5,feeling pretty intense. Things have kind of gone downhill since I was here last time.,inactive,157_5,P,gt,-1.0,Feeling bahut intense hoon. Last time jab main yahan tha tab se things thik nahi hain.

So So tell me what has happened, what what is what's shifted?",story,157_8,T,gc,0.0,"Mainne hum baat kiya hai uss time jab tumne aur Kalie ne engage kiya tha, aur tum apne jeevan ke liye exciting plans ke liye bahut utsaahit the. To ab mujhe batao kya hua hai, kya kuch badlaav hua hai?"
9,"I think that we've just sort of fallen back. You know, I was really hopeful that and with the proposal also came the promise to, you know, work on the relationship and work on anger and work on, you know, being the couple that we we hope to be, and that it's not happening its not happening. We're right back to where we were. ",symp/reasoning,157_9,P,id,-1.0,"Main mere khyaal hai ki hum bilkul peeche chal diye hain. Pata hai, main bahut umeedwaar tha ki aur is saath jo vyaaphar hua hai usme wada bhi tha ki hum rishte par kaam karenge, gussa ko kam karne ka kaam karenge aur hum woh jodi banenge jaise hum chahte hain, lekin yeh hone hi nahi de raha hai. Hum ab wapas usi jagah par pahunch gaye hain jahan se humne shuru kiya tha."
10,"I'm sorry to hear that. I know you were. You were excited. You were feeling hopeful for change. And I don't get that same sense from you right now. In fact, it seems like you're feeling pretty sad and maybe even a little hopeless about that situation. Well, how can I make How can I be helpful and supportive and useful to you right now.",symp/reasoning,157_10,T,ap,0.0,"मुझे यह सुनकर खेद हुआ। मुझे पता है कि आप थे। आप उत्साहित थे। आप बदलाव के लिए आशावादी महसूस कर रहे थे। और अभी मुझे आपसे वही भाव प्राप्त नहीं हो रहा है। वास्तव में, आपको उस स्थिति के बारे में बहुत उदास और शायद थोड़ा निराश होने का लगता है। अब, मैं आपके लिए कैसे मददगार और सहयोगी और उपयो"
11,I just I don't I don't know how to make change. I don't know how to I don't know how to end this. I don't know how to get out. I don't know how to. I just I can't do it anymore.,inactive,157_11,P,id,-3.0,Main dilmai aata nahin par chupkar kaar dena nahin aata. Pata nahin kaise kahunion mein secret rakhna hai. Main pareshaan hoon. Pata nahin kya karna hai. Main sab bas ho nahin sakta.
12,"So you've decided to make a change. And in fact, it sounds like you've decided to leave the relationship. ",symp/reasoning,157_12,T,gc,0.0,"Toh tumne faisla kiya hai ki tum kuch badalna chahte ho. Aur sacchi, lagta hai ki tumne rishtey se door hone ka faisla kiya hai."
13,"I don't know. I mean, I want to I don't want to be in it. But I don't, I don't know how to get to not being in it.",symp/reasoning,157_13,P,id,-3.0,"Muje nahi pata. Mera matlab hai, mai chahta hu ki mai isme na ho. Par mai nahi janti, mai isse bahar kaise niklu."
14,"So you're thinking about it. It's not that you've committed or decided that you absolutely want to leave the relationship. But correct me if I'm wrong. What you're saying is, you want to make a change, and you don't want this relationship as it is. ",symp/reasoning,157_14,T,gc,0.0,"Toh tu soch raha hai. Ye nahi hai ke tu fazool hogaya hai ya decide kar liya hai ke tu relationship se nikalna chahata hai. Lekin mujhe sahi hona par bata dena. Tumhara kehna hai, tum change karna chahte ho, aur tum is relationship se aise hi nahi rehna chahte."
15,Yeah.,inactive,157_15,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
16,"Now, what what are you when you think about changing? What what ideas? I mean, I guess you mentioned leaving, what other possibilities or thoughts have you had about change and what that might look like?",symp/reasoning,157_16,T,irq,0.0,"Abhi, jab tum change ke bare mein sochte ho, to tum kya ho? Kya kya vichaar hai? Mera matlab hai, tumne jaane ki baat ki, kya aur kya badalne ka vichar kiya hai aur uska roop kaisa ho sakta hai?"
17,"I don't know. It just feels so overwhelming when I think about it. I just I can't seem to find a way out of it. and that feels feels ethical. It feels like it can No, I don't want to hurt her. I just don't want to be in this relationship anymore.",symp/reasoning,157_17,P,id,-1.0,"Mujhe nahi pata. Jab main iske baare me sochta hu, toh yeh bahut hi overwhelming lagta hai. Main bus ise se nikalne ka koi rasta nahi dhoond pa raha hu. Aur yeh sahi lagta hai ki mujhe galat lag raha hai. Yeh lagta hai ki main nahi chahta ki main use chot pahuchau. Main bus is rishte me nahi rehna chahta."
18,Why don't you want to be in this relationship anymore?,symp/reasoning,157_18,T,irq,0.0,Tum is rishte mein nahi rehna chahte kya?
19,"It's not healthy. It's I'm not happy. I can't imagine that she's happy even though she says she is. It's, you know, we're fighting constantly. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with her. She's overprotective. She just it doesn't feel right. just doesn't feel right.",symp/reasoning,157_19,P,id,-1.0,"Yeh swasth ni hai. Yeh mujhe khush ni hai. Mujhe yakeen ni hota ki woh khush hai, woh khud kehti hai ki hai. Yeh, tum jaante ho, hum constant ladai krte hain. Mujhe lagta hai jaise mai uske sath pairon pe chal rhi hu. Woh bahot dhyan rakhne wali hai. Woh bus yeh lgra hai ki kuch shi ni hai. Kuch shi ni hai bus."
20,"It doesn't feel right. So, what would feel right?",symp/reasoning,157_20,T,irq,0.0,"Yeh sahi nahi lagta. Toh, kya sahi lagta?"
21,"Ah, that's a huge question. I just don't I'm not sure just this isn't right.",symp/reasoning,157_21,P,id,-1.0,"Ah, woh ek badi sawaal hai. Main yahi nahi samajh paa rahi hu ki yeh thik nahi hai."
22,"So the way things are is not right. It's not working, you don't feel supported. This isn't the kind of relationship that that you want or that you had hoped that it would be. ",symp/reasoning,157_22,T,crq,0.0,"So the way things are, it's not sahi. Things are not chal raha hai, you don't feel supported. This isn't the tarah ka rishta that you want or thought it would be."
23,"Yeah. I mean, when we started it was it was lovely. She was amazing. She was this super caring and thoughtful woman and you know, we are lots of same interests, you know, same friends it's, you know, she was just fantastic. And I don't know, I don't know where that changed. And I feel like we did this on again off again stuff and it's just, it just seems like, just not right. And I know, I know, I don't deserve to be treated this way. And I know that I'm, I'm better than that.",symp/reasoning,157_23,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan. Main isliye keh raha tha, jab humne shuru kiya tha toh itna pyaara tha. Woh lajawab thi. Woh ek bahut hi parwaaz dil aur soch-vichaar wali aurat thi aur samajhlijiye, hum mein bohot saare milte-julte interests the, humare saare doston ke saath connections the. Woh sach mein badiya thi. Lekin pata nahi kahan se kuch badal gaya. Aur mujhe lagta hai, humne on aur off ka khel khele aur yeh, yeh bas sahi nahi lag raha hai. Aur mai jaanta hoon, mai aise tarike se behave karne ke laayak nahi hoon. Aur mujhe bhi pata hai ki mai us se behtar hoon."
24,"You really value your self and your well being and in your spirit. And it sounds like you don't feel like you're taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship and Even though things started out well, they haven't turned out to be the kind of relationship that you want for yourself",symp/reasoning,157_24,T,gc,0.0,"Tum apni taakat aur apne swasthya ko bahut ehmiyat dete ho aur apne jazbaat mein bhi. Aur lagta hai ki aap apne aap ki acchi tarah se dekhbaal nahi kar rahe hain kyunki aap is rishtey mein rehkar khush nahi hain aur chahe vaqt shuru mein kaisa bhi ho, yeh aapke liye apne aap ke liye woh rishta nahi ban gaya jaisa aap chahte hain."
25,"No, but you know, but she's lovely and I love her and I can't imagine. I can't imagine my life without her in it.",inactive,157_25,P,cd,-1.0,"Nahi par tu jaanta hai, par woh bahut pyaari hai aur main usse pyaar karta hu aur main imagine nahi kar sakta. Main apni zindagi ko uske bina nahi soch sakta."
26,So you feeling torned?,inactive,157_26,T,yq,0.0,Kya tuhme torna ho raha hai?
27,Yeah,inactive,157_27,P,op,0.0,Haan
28,"you're you're torned between your love and affection for her and your sense of honoring yourself, and you've got a lot of mixed feelings. And you are saying that you need something to change that sounds like you're able to kind of hold that complexity, if you will, that you've got these strong feelings for this person and you don't feel like this is the good relationship for you. ",symp/reasoning,157_28,T,gc,0.0,"आप अपने प्यार और स्नेह से उस लड़की के बीच अपनी भावनाओं और अपने आप को सम्मानित करने की भावना से फंसे हैं, और आपके मन में कई उलझन हैं। और आपकह रहे हैं कि आपको कुछ बदलाव की जरूरत है जो ऐसा लगता है कि आप उस परिस्थिति से निपटने के लिए सक्षम हैं, अगर आप चाहें तो, कि आपके पास इस व्यक्ति के लिए ये मजबूत भावनाएं हैं और आपको"
29,No. I think it's  not good for either one of us.,symp/reasoning,157_29,P,cd,-1.0,Nahi. Mujhe lagta hai yeh na to hum dono ke liye achha hai.
30,"For both of you. Yeah. So so then you've talked a little bit about leaving. I mean, tell me more about what you thought about. And when you think about making a change in terms of leaving, what, what might that look like for you?",symp/reasoning,157_30,T,gc,0.0,"Tum dono ke liye. Haan. Toh phir tumne leaving ke baare mein thoda sa baat ki. Mera matlab yeh hai ki tumhari thoughts kya hai. Aur jab tum leaving ki baat karte ho, toh kuch badlao ka soch rhe ho toh wo tumhare liye kaisa hoga?"
31,"I don't know. I mean, it feels. I just can't imagine my life without her in it. So the idea of not having her there feels really scary. And the idea of staying the way it is, and things not changing, feels even scarier. So I don't I don't know how to and I don't even know how I would do that. Our lives are so intertwined. I mean, my business, our friends, the queer community is so small, you know, that's my family as much as my friends and my family as well. And so just, you know, how do you how do you extract yourself from that in a way For me, like, in a way that I feel, I'm doing that with grace and respect for her and respect for myself.",symp/reasoning,157_31,P,id,-1.0,"Meri jaankari nahi hai. Matlab, mujhe lagta hai. Meri zindagi uske bina sochne se dar lagta hai. Toh uski kami se mujhe bohot daraavna lagta hai. Aur yeh soch ki sab kuch vaisa hi rahega aur kuch bhi badle ga nahi, usse bhi zyada daraavna lagta hai. Toh main nahi jaanti aur main jaanti hi nahi ki main yeh kaise karungi. Hamari zindagi itni gehri mili huyi hai. Matlab, meri business, hamare dost, LGBTQ samuday itna chota hai, pata hai, woh mera parivaar aur dost hai. Aur isliye, bas, aap kaise aap khud ko isse alag karoge? Mujhe aisa konse tarikese karna hai jisme main mahsus karu, ki main isse uski aur apni izzat se kar rahi hoon."
32,"What What thoughts do you have about how you do that? How do you extract yourself? How might you extract yourself in a way that has some integrity and grace as you said,",symp/reasoning,157_32,T,irq,0.0,"Tumhare dimaag mein kya khayal hain ki t'am ko kaise karte ho? T'am khudko nikalna kaise hai? Tum khudko nikalne ka tareeka batao jo thoda sammaan aur shishtata ke saath ho, jaisa tumne kaha."
33,"I don't I don't even know. I mean, talk to my friend Jay about it and I don't know he suggested like a break, but I don't I don't know. I just don't want to get caught in that on again off again before like, you know, like we've done before and, but the idea of a break. feels a little less. I don't know, maybe more gentle. I don't know,",symp/reasoning,157_33,P,id,0.0,"Main to bas aise hi soch rahi thi ki, mere dost Jay se is bare mein baat karo aur pata nahi kya bola ki hum ek chhutti le lein, par main nahi chahti ki hum phir se waise hi chakkar mein pad jayein jaise humne pehle bhi kiya hai. Lekin thoda sa break lene ki soch, thoda sa kam intense lag raha hai. Mujhe nahi pata, shayad thoda sa araam se karna ho."
34,say more a little more gentle.,inactive,157_34,T,cv,0.0,थोड़ा और दयालु होकर ज्य
35,"I don't know how to give us both time to really think about it and and I don't know, maybe maybe she'll change maybe maybe if I'm you know, if this is it, if this is it, like if this break is it, maybe Maybe she'll be able to change.",story,157_35,P,cr,-3.0,"Mujhe nahi pata ki hum dono ko samay dena kaise hoga is par sochne ke liye aur mujhe nahi pata, shayad shayad woh badal jayegi, shayad agar main aapko pata hoon, agar yeh woh hai, agar yeh break woh hai, shayad woh badal jayegi."
36,"I heard you say that. Live it, you know, moving on and having a life without Kelly is really scary. In fact, it's almost impossible for you to imagine what that would look like, especially with the way that your lives are so intertwined. I also heard you say that the thought of not making a change is scarier. And I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about what you mean by that.",routine,157_36,T,irq,0.0,"Maine suna hai ki tumne kaha ki. Yeh jee lo, pata hai na, Kelly ke bina jeevan ko aage badhana aur jeena bahut darravna hai. Haqeeqat mein, tumhare liye toh soch bhi nahi sakte ki woh kaisa dikhega, khas karke tumhare zindagi kitni gahrai se jude huye hain. Maine bhi suna hai ki tumne kaha ki kisi badlav ki soch bhi darravna hai. Aur mujhe yeh janna tha ki tum kya matlab kehte ho?"
37,"It's just I feel exhausted. I feel like I'm not. I'm not who I was. When I came into this relationship. I feel like I'm constantly struggling to make her happy, and that just doesn't work. There's nothing I can do. And I feel like I've lost my joy. And I don't know. I'm just afraid of what will happen if I just keep staying in a place where I feel like I'm falling apart. Hmm, my piece. ",symp/reasoning,157_37,P,id,-3.0,"Bas yehi hai ki mujhe bohot thaka hua mehsoos hota hai. Main waisa nahi lagta. Main woh nahi hoon jo pehle tha jab main is rishte mein aaya tha. Mujhe aisa lagta hai ki main hamesha se hi usko khush rakhne mein laga rehta hoon, aur yehi chal nahi padega. Main kuchh nahi kar sakta. Aur mujhe aisa lagta hai ki maine apna khushi khokhli hai. Aur mujhe pata nahi. Main bus darta hoon ki kya hoga agar main wahi rahoon jahan se main toot raha hoon. Hmm, mere hisse ki baat hai."
38,"Yeah. So you're concerned about your own well being and your own joy and your, your spirit if you you stay and don't make this change, and that's the part that's really scary for you. ",routine,157_38,T,crq,0.0,"Haan. Toh aap apni khushi aur khud ke khud ko fikar kar rahe ho, aur apne aap ko, apna jaanbaksh aur apna aatma agar aap yahaan rukte hain aur yeh badlaav nahi karte, aur yahi woh hissa hai jo aapke liye sach mein darawana lag raha hai."
39,Yeah.,inactive,157_39,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
40,You mentioned that your friend suggested possibly taking a little break. And you said that that was a scary thought for you. And I guess I'd like to hear more additional thoughts you might have about that as a as an option for you.,story,157_40,T,gc,0.0,Tumne bataya ki tumhare dost ne possibly ek short break lena suggest kiya hai. Aur tumne kaha ki yeh tumhare liye ek darawna sujhav hai. Mai suppose karna chahunga ki aur bhi kuch additional thoughts hai tumhare paas uske bare mein.
41,"Well, it seems like I mean, if it could happen if we could find a way to make it happen that it would be it would just give me some time to think about, like, what I want and what I need and, and, you know, I feel like I can't sort out what's me in this anymore. And, and so like if I have that space, just to sort of breathe and not have to worry about her feelings and Taking care of her and just being able to focus on myself for a little while. I don't know, it seems like that would be helpful.",story,157_41,P,gc,-3.0,"Arey, it feels like ki agar hum uss kismet ko pa sake jahan yeh ho sakta hai toh yeh ho sakti thi..bas mujhe thoda waqt dekar sochne ka mauka mil jaye, aisi lagta hai. Jaise ki mein kya chahti hoon aur mujhe kya zarurat hai, aur pata nahi, aaj kal mujhe lagta hai ki iss main kaunsa mera hai aur kaunsa nahi. Aur, agar mujhe woh jagah mil jaye jahan main bas saans le saku aur uski sensitive feelings ki chinta na karun aur sirf apne aap par dhyaan de saku kuch samay ke liye. Pata nahi, mujhe lagta hai yeh madad karegi."
42,"It sounds like you're feeling like you're so in, in it just so in the the mixed emotions and the sense of hopelessness and sadness and disappointment that it's really hard for you to see out of it. And an advantage reason to take a break would be just to give you a moment to breathe and look around and collect yourself and not be so stuck in that ambivalence, if you will, that sense of not knowing. ",routine,157_42,T,crq,0.0,"ऐसा लग रहा है कि तुम लग रहे हो कि तुम हो बहुत, इसमें बस इसलिए कि आप एम्बिवेलेंस में और आशाहीनता और उदासी और निराशा के एहसास में इतने लग रहे हो कि यह आपके लिए बहुत मुश्किल है उस से बाहर निकलने के लिए। और एक बेहतर वजह अवधारणा है कि आप एक अवकाश ले लें तो बस आपको जाने दें कि सांस लेने के लिए और चारों ओर देखने के लिए और स्वयं को इकठ्ठा करने के लिए और उस अस्थिर"

I just kind of wrote this down really quickly, but on a scale of zero to 10 zero being not motivated at all and 10 being extremely motivated. how motivated would you say you are to take a break in your relationship right now?",routine,157_44,T,irq,0.0,"Aye, agar teri baat ho, main tujhse yeh guzarish karna chahunga ki tu iss ek lakh dekhe is riyasat ko.

55,Exactly.,inactive,157_55,P,cd,0.0,Bilkul
56,"Well, kind of following up on that on a scale of zero to 10 zero being not confident at all. 10 being extremely confident. How confident are you that if you decided to take a break from your relationship with Kelly, you would be successful at making that happen?",routine,157_56,T,irq,0.0,"Accha, thoda us par dhyan dena, zero se lekar das tak ka scale hai, jisme zero matlab bilkul bhi confident nahi aur das matlab bohot hi confident.

57,I don't know maybe like a three or four.,routine,157_57,P,id,-1.0,"Mujhe nahi pata, sayad aise teen ya chaar."

65,it creates a lot of anxiety for me.,symp/reasoning,157_65,P,id,-2.0,यह मेरे लिए बहुत चिंता का कारण बनता ह
66,Yeah. What do you think needs to be different in order for you to feel more confident about successfully being able to take a brief break.,routine,157_66,T,orq,0.0,Han ji. Tum kya sochte ho ki tumhe apni uplabbdhata ke baare mein adhik vishwas hona chahiye taki tum ek chota sa break le sako.

So I really appreciate you spending the time to share with me with with this has been like for you. You've been feeling stuck. And things were great for a while you had some hope that things were going to change and now you are realizing that Kelly's not going to change and that you are suffering in the process that you are really being kept from your aspirations and your dreams, in a lot of different regards. You know, that you need to make a change, you want to make a change, and you have a lot of mixed feelings about this change. You know, it's what you want to do, it's the right thing for you. And you still really care and love, Kelly. And you're also concerned, kind of on an outer level, about your business, about your community, about your family and your friends and how they may be affected by a breakup. In order to make this more manageable, you're thinking maybe in terms of smaller change, like taking a small break, as opposed to breaking off the relationship and you feel like you're pretty ready. You're somewhat You know, you're motivated. And then maybe a little less confident. But you also said that if you were able to maybe think through a concrete plan, that that might help you feel more confident.

Aap stuck feel kar rahi hain. Aur kuch samay ke liye sab theek tha, aapko kuch aasha thi ki sab badal jayega, lekin ab aap smajh rahi hain ki Kelly badalne wali nahi hai aur aap iss process mein bhaut kuch sahan kar rahe hain. Aapki khwahishein aur sapne aap se nazar gira rakhi ja rahi hain. Aapko yeh maloom hai ki aapko kuch badlav ki zaroorat hai, aur aap badlav karna chahti hain, lekin aapke mann mein kuch uljhanen bhi hain iss badlav ke baare mein. Aap jaanti hain ki yeh aapke liye sahi hoga, aur yeh aapke liye sahi faisla hoga. Aur aap abhi bhi Kelly se pyaar aur mohabbat karti hain. Aap ki fikar bhi hai, bahut saare mamle pe, apne vyapaar, apni samaj, apne parivar aur apne doston ke baare mein ki unhe iss rishtey ki khatir kya asar padega. Iss sab ko kam karne ke liye, aap choti choti badlav pe zyada focus kar rahi hain, jaise ki chot"
