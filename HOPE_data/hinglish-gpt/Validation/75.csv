1,"Yes, it's really hard. So like when I'm in the middle of being worried, I'm it's really hard for me to focus. So I can't focus on like what I need to do. Because I feel like my mind is on a lot of different things and I can't focus on you know exactly what I should be doing. It's just like, I'm worried about You know, all the different aspects.",symp/reasoning,75_1,P,id,-1.0,"Haan, bahut mushkil hai. Jaise jab main chinta mein beech mein hoti hun, tab mere liye dhyan dena bohot mushkil ho jata hai. Main apne karna zaroori kaam par dhyan nahi de paati kyunki mere dimaag mein bohot saare alag-alag cheezein hoti hain aur main tum par dhyan nahi de sakti. Yeh bas aisa hai, main Chinta mein hun na, sabhi alag-alag pahluon ki wajah se."
2,"Alright, so your ability to concentrate and do the hard work of preparing is affected",symp/reasoning,75_2,T,crq,,"Achcha, tao tumhare pas samadhan karne ki kshamata aur ready hone ka mein kaam peh asar ho raha hai."

4,"Alright, so this excessive worrying and all this interfering of preparing all this goes on right up until you're getting ready to present",routine,75_4,T,crq,,"Theek hai, toh yeh atyadhik chinta aur saari is beechh mein tayar hone ke beechh sab beechh mein bhalaai jaari rehti hai jab tak ki aap taiyaar hone mein lage hai."

Humare paas koi kaam aane wala hai jiske karan tumhari ability pe asar padh raha hai, par tumhe usse pareshani bhi ho rahi hai."
7,Yeah.,inactive,75_7,P,op,,Haan.
8,Now these presentations are in class? ,routine,75_8,T,irq,,Abb ki presentation toh class mein hain?
9,Yeah,routine,75_9,P,id,,Arre ha
10,So it's you're in you're in the classroom. Do you write the only one to present in that classroom is it rotate through several PV?,story,75_10,T,irq,,So it's tum tum classroom mein ho. Kya tum sirf ek hi ko present karne ke liye likhate ho ya fir kuch PV se ghoomte rehte ho?
11,"It depends on the presentation. Sometimes there's like one or two other people that have to present that night, depending on like how long the topic is.",story,75_11,P,id,,"Yeh presentation par nirbhar karta hai. Kabhi kabhi raat ko uske alava ek ya do aur log bhi hote hain jo presentation karna hai, topic kitna lamba hai us par nirbhar karta hai."
12,"All right, well, let's choose the last time you presented that classes as a template. What was the order to go in there?",story,75_12,T,irq,,"Theek thik hai, accha, aap uss template ko presentation karne wale pehle waqt ko chun lete hain. Wahan kya baatsheertijh hai?"
13,"Well, the one that I really messed up, I think in that I was first But usually, like, I'm like, second maybe.",story,75_13,P,id,,"""I really messed up in that one, but usually I'm second, I think."""
14,"Okay. So for this example, let's say you're through the second. Okay, so you're sitting in the classroom and another student is presenting. What's going through mind that?",story,75_14,T,irq,,"So for this example, let's assume you have gone till the second. Okay, so you're sitting in the classroom and another student is giving a presentation. What is going on in your head?"
15,"I feel like I am totally zoned out. Like I'm not even paying attention to what that person saying, because I'm so worried about how I'm gonna mess it up. You know, I'm, I'm starting to like be sweaty, like my hands are clammy, my heart started to race a little bit, and I'm just totally zoned out on what they're doing. Just, you know, worrying about what's gonna happen when I get up there.",story,75_15,P,id,-2.0,"Mujhe lagta hai ki mai poori tarah se zoned out hoon. Aisa lagta hai ki main woh vyakti ke baat par dhyaan hi nahi de raha hu, kyunki main itna pareshan hu ki main usse kaise bigaada hoga. Pata hai, meri haath paani chalk jate hai, dil thoda tez tez dhadakne lage hai, aur main bilkul unke kareeb se zoned out hoon. Bass, fikr hai ki mai upar jaake kya hoga."
16,"So in that moment as you're seated, you're not really watching their presentation as much because you have these strong or somewhat strong physical symptoms. You have your heart racing a bit is sweaty palms. You're zoned out. Have you ever felt the need desire to, like, run out of the room?",story,75_16,T,id,,"So uss waqt jab tum baith kar dekhte ho, aap unke presentation ko utna dhyan nahi de rahe ho kyunki tumhare paas ye zor-dar ya thoda zor-dar shareeri lakshan hote hain. Tumhari dil ki dhadkan tezz chal rahi hai aur paalmo mein pasina hai. Tum bilkul apni hi duniya mein khoye huye ho. Kya kabhi tumne mehsus kiya hai ki tumhe un mehmaan ke kamre se bahar bhaagna chahiye?"
17,Yes. It's funny you should say that was a little bit hesitant to mention that but I kind of I do I feel like I need to find excuse to like use the bathroom or I just need to get out of there.,story,75_17,P,op,,"Yes. It's fun toh tu yeh kehne ke chakkar mein uljha hua tha ki par maine kabhi kabhi apni jarurat batadeni ki halat tha, par mujhe aise mein toh sirf bathroom jaana tha ya wahan se jaldi se bahar aana zaroori hota tha."
18,"Yeah, so what do you feel is most pressuring you to leave the room like what? What symptom?",inactive,75_18,T,irq,,"""Yeah, toh kya tumhe lagta hai ki tumhe kamre se jaane ke liye sabse zyada dabav padh raha hai, jaise kya? Kya lakshan hai?"""
19,"Um,",inactive,75_19,P,gc,,या
20,"And what thoughts are going through your mind right then like, so let's take that kind of severe moment. When you're, you're, let's just say still before the presentation, okay? So you're sitting at the desk and your heart rates elevated. And you're not focusing on what they're doing. You're zoned out your anxieties high. What was going through your mind right, then?",routine,75_20,T,irq,,"Aur tumhare dimaag mein kya khayal aa rahe hain, jaise ki, to chalo us prakar ke gambhiri pal ko lete hain. Jab tum, tum, chalo bas kehte hain ki abhi bhi presentation ke pehle, thik hai? To tum apne table par baitha hua ho aur tumhara dil ka dhadkan tej ho raha hai. Aur tum par focus nahi kar rahe ho jo wo kar rahe hain. Tum apni tasawwur se alag ho tumhare tanaav bahut zyada hai. Tumhare dimaag mein kya soch rahe the, phir?"
21,"I think I'm thinking, like, I'm gonna bomb this anyway. So I might as well just, you know, not go through the stress of having to do it. Like I've already in my head, I know that it's going to end badly.",symp/reasoning,75_21,P,id,-2.0,"Mera toh khayal hai ki main soch raha hoon, jaise hi main abhi toot jaunga. Isliye main bas yahi sochne ki koshish kar raha hoon ki ise na karoon. Jaise hi maine apne dimagh mein soch liya hai, main janta hoon ki yeh bura hi khatam hoga."
22,So you've already failed.,story,75_22,T,crq,,Toh tum already fail ho gaye ho.
23,"right. So there's no sense in getting up there. And maybe if I don't get up there, you know, I guess it couldn't be any worse. So I might as well just leave",story,75_23,P,cd,,"Bilkul. To yahaan uthna koi fayda nahi hai. Aur shayad agar main wahan nahi utha, to tum jaante ho, mujhe kahaan bhalaai milegi. Is liye main bas chala jaata hoon."
24,Are you embarrassed that the professor or Other students will see that you were really anxious?,story,75_24,T,yq,,क्या आप शर्मिंदा हो कि प्रोफ़ेसर या अन्य छात्र देखेंगे कि आप सचमुच चिंत
25,"Yeah, I don't want I figure if I leave and people won't, will just make me think I was sick or whatever. And it'll be a better situation, if I just left then happened to see me up there, you know, sweating and all these other symptoms that I have when I actually get up there, it would be better just to leave before that starts.",story,75_25,P,op,-2.0,"Haan, mujhe nahi chahiye ki agar main chhoot jaun aur log us waqt nahin mile, toh mujhe lagta hai ki main bimaar tha ya koi aur baat hai. Aur yeh ek aur accha halaat hoga agar main bas us se pehle hi chala jaun phir mujhe wahan upar dekhna ho toh, paseene chadhne aur aur aise hi lakshan jaan lena ki main ust pahunchne ke waqt hote hain, acha hoga ki main usse pehle hi chala jaun."
26,"Okay. So, so better to be thought ill and had to leave because you're saying. ",story,75_26,T,crq,,"Acha. Toh, sochne se kharab hona behtar hai aur jaana padna kyunki aap keh rahe ho."
27,"Yeah, or have them wonder what happened then to just be up in front of everybody, you know,",story,75_27,P,cd,,"Haan ya phir unhein sochna padega ki phir kya hua aur sabke saamne aa jaane se pehle bas aap sab ke saamne hain, samjhe na?"
28,to have a severe anxiety for that buddy. And then they can very embarrassing. That would be a very undesirable outcome for you.,routine,75_28,T,crq,,Mere paas us dost ke liye gambhir chinta hona chahiye. Fir woh bahut sharmnaak ho sakte hai. Yeh aapke liye bahut anutthi parinam hoga.
29,Right.,inactive,75_29,P,cd,,Theek hai
30,"So as you're debating that thought, because that's coming to your head, and you're thinking I just need to, yeah, gotta get out here. What happens there, so we're maybe What, 15 minutes before we present? So tell me about that. So you have that thought you want to flee,",story,75_30,T,irq,,"Toh jab aap us vichaar par bahas kar rahe hai, kyunki wo aapke dimaag mein aa raha hai, aur aap ye soch rahe hai ki mujhe bas yahan se nikalna hai. Waha par kya hota hai, to hum lagbhag 15 minutes pehle present karne se pehle hai? To uske baare mein bataiye. Toh aapko woh vichaar hai ki aap bhagne chahte hai."
31,"right. And I'm looking at the clock and saying, you know, like, how much more time in this presentation before I have to go like, should I go? Should I not go? What are the consequences of running out? You know, and kind of playing out, which would be worse?",story,75_31,P,id,,"Sahi. Aur mai ghadi dekh rahe hu aur bol rahe hu, tumhe pata hai, ki presentation me abhi aur kitna samay hai, tab tak mai jana chahiye ya nahi, jaau ya na jau? Khatam ho jane ke kya nuksaan honge? Tumhe pata hai, aise hi soch rhe hai, ki kaunsa bura hoga?"
32,Have you ever had to run out?,story,75_32,T,yq,,Kya tumhe kabhi nikalna pada hai?
33,"Um, once I went to the bathroom to try to, like calm myself down or talk to myself, or you know, like, Cool off my face. Um, but I came back",story,75_33,P,op,,"Um, eka baar mujhe bathroom gaye Gaye tha toh mai, apne aap ko shaant karne ya khud se baatein karne ki koshish karne gaye, ya pata nahi, vapas aake apna chehra thandak pohchaane gaye. Um, par mai lautke aagaye."
34,"and you presented then you presented Alright, so you you survived. One of the more stressful presentations",story,75_34,T,crq,,"Okay, so you gave a presentation and you survived. It can be really stressful to present, after all."
35,"Yeah, I almost felt like I was gonna be ill. I was so stressed that day.",story,75_35,P,cd,,"Haan, main toh almost lag raha tha ki mujhe bimaar hona padega. Main us din itna stressed tha."
36,"That was very, very tough on you. What happened on that particular day?",story,75_36,T,irq,,"Uss din tum par bahut, bahut bojh tha. Kya us din kuchh hua tha?"
37,"So typically, like, I go to load my presentation, at this point, like, I have my new cards or whatever, in front of me. I am like, shaking at this point. I am so I don't know if it's scared, or worried or maybe a combination of everything. And I'm just like sweating. My heart is racing. Like I almost feel dizzy. I'm just so stressed out about what's going to happen. And then you know, I'm starting to speak. And then the presentations are usually like 20 minutes or so. Okay, so I have to stay up there for the duration and I'm just like, you know, sweating and then I'm wondering like, are people looking at me or people? Can people see it? You know, am I going to forget something?",story,75_37,P,id,-2.0,"So, basically, like, I have to go and load my presentation, and by that time, I have my new cards or whatever, in front of me. I'm like, trembling at this point. I am so, I don't know if it's fear or worry or maybe a mix of both. And I'm just sweating. My heart is pounding. Like, I almost feel dizzy. I'm just so stressed out about what's going to happen. And then, you know, I start speaking. And the presentations usually last around 20 minutes. So, I have to stay up there for that long, and I'm just like, sweating and then I'm thinking like, are people looking at me or what? Can they see it? You know, am I going to forget something?"
38,"So the some of the thoughts are you wonder if they can see how anxious you are you wonder if you're gonna do poorly on the presentation,",story,75_38,T,crq,,"Toh kuch vichaare hai ki kya wo dekh sakte hai ki aap kitne bechain hai, aap sochte hai ki aap presentation me bura karne wale hai."
39,"right. Or they think I've been lazy and I didn't prepare, are they going to think that, you know, I'm dumb or I don't know, you know what I'm doing.",story,75_39,P,cd,,"Sahi ya toh woh samajhte hain ki maine kuch nahi kiya hai aur taiyaari na hui hai, kya yeh sochenge ki main nikamma hoon ya mujhe pata nahi hai ki main kya kar raha hoon."
40,"So they might, they might think less of you as a person.",story,75_40,T,crq,,"So wo shayad, wo tumhari shaqs-e insaniyat pe kam kuam soch sakte hain."
41,Right. Or like be judging me. Okay.,story,75_41,P,cd,,Thik hai. Ya mujhe judge kar rahe ho. Theek hai.
42,Yeah. So there's a number of concerns that kind of going through your mind in that moment. So when does this start to turn around so you start presenting is 20 minutes you initially get up there and get your presentation up on the The projection monitor. Yeah. When does it start to turn the corner?,story,75_42,T,id,,"Haan. Toh vaha kuch chintaayein hai jinhe aapke dimaag me sampurna samay me rehna hai. Toh iss baat par, jaab aap upar ek na ek baar khada hotein ho aur aapka presentation The projection monitor me upar aa jaata hai, tab yeh sab maamla kis samay ek mod par badalna shuru hota hai?"
43,"Um, it's depends sometimes I settled down a little bit, but then usually like that, I get some sort of rhythm I think. And then, but then it gets anxiety again until I get my grades. Do you know what I mean? And I'm like, until, because I feel like I'm gonna do poorly. Until that happens when",story,75_43,P,id,,"Uh, sometimes I manage to calm down a bit, but then usually I get into a kind of flow I guess. But then, it triggers my anxiety until I find out my grades. Do you understand what I'm saying? And then I keep worrying until I actually get the results."
44,when you receive the grades.,story,75_44,T,crq,,Jab aapko grade mile.
45,"Sometimes, like she usually doesn't give them that day but like often like the next day or the day after",story,75_45,P,cd,,"कभी-कभी, जैसे वह आम तौर पर उन्हें उस दिन नहीं देती है लेकिन अक्सर अगले दिन या फिर उसक"
46,So does that intense anxiety that you're having while you're presenting last all the way?,story,75_46,T,yq,,"Toh kya tumhare presentation ke dauran jo gahri chinta hai, vo poori tarah se rahati hai?"
47,now? It definitely like dissipates once I can like go sit down.,story,75_47,P,on,,Abhi? Ye bilkul ghatta hai jabtak main bethne jaa sakta hun.
48,"Okay, so so the sort of next big drop off for symptoms would be when you're done with  the presentation",symp/reasoning,75_48,T,crq,,"Okay, so, baaki sab kaam toh ho gaya, ab agla bada farak aayega jab presentation ho jayega."
49,"Yeah, when eyes are maybe no longer on me. They've moved on to somebody else. So I figured like, okay, they forgot about me. I'm safe.",symp/reasoning,75_49,P,cd,,"Haan, jab aankhein shayad mujh par se hat gayi ho. Ab woh kisi aur par chali gayi hai. Isliye maine socha, thik hai, unhone mujhe bhool gaye hai. Main surakshit hoon."
50,"All right, then. But then there's this other worry of now we have to see what the grades are right?",symp/reasoning,75_50,T,yq,,"Theek hai, phir. Lekin phir yeh aur fikar hai ki ab humein dekhna hoga ki grades kya hai, theek?"
51,And I convince myself that I did poorly.,symp/reasoning,75_51,P,id,-1.0,और मैं खुद को यकीन दिलाता हूं कि मै
52,So the thought is going through your mind is I'm gonna receive a bad grade.,routine,75_52,T,yq,,Socho tou humara dimaag mein ghoom rahi hai ke mujhe ek kharab darja milne waala hai.
53,"Yeah, and that everyone saw me, you know, sweating and all these symptoms that I have everyone is judging me",symp/reasoning,75_53,P,op,,"Haan, aur sabne mujhe dekha, pata hai, pasina bahaata huve aur is saare lakshano ke sath joh mujhe hai woh sab mujhe tashreef rakhte hai."
54,summary,"The patient is worried and it is hard for them to focus. The patient is not able to present to the class successfully. If it their turn to present next, they zone out completely, heart racing, sweating and think of walking out. The patient once walked out of a presentation, but came back and presented. The patient is anxious if the people could see them sweating and other symptoms, or if they think the patient hasn't prepared. The patient feels they might be judged. After the presentation, the patient's anxiety level immediately drops once they are seated and everyone's eyes are off them. But then, they are anxious about their grades next which will be given in a day or two for which the patient convinces themselves that they did poorly. ",,,,,
