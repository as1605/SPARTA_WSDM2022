And I guess I come here today to Tell you like, Oh, I want to leave uni I guess that's why Coming to you today. ",symp/reasoning,198_1,P,id,,"Arey, I'm working full time. I'm part time student.

Achcha, aur ab to mere exams bhi fail ho gaye, ek bohot bade exam ka. Aur ab main aisa feel kar rahi hoon ki main aur kuch nahi kar sakti hoon. Mai kuch nahi kar sakti hoon, sahi hain. Stress mujhe bohot hai, aur mujhe lagta hai ki mai bohot naakaam hoon, meri family ko bhi embarrass kar diya hai fail hokar. Yeah, main bas ye kya karoon, mai ab kuch nahi samajh rahi hoon. Aur main aaj aapko bataane aayi hoon ki mujhe lagta hai ki, arre uni chhod hi doon, isi liye main aaj aapke paas aayi hoon."
2,"Okay, so it sounds like a whole lot of stuffs on top of you ",inactive,198_2,T,crq,,"Acha, toh lagta hai ki poora tere upar kaafi zyada cheezein hain."
3,Yeah that's so much just piling on me,inactive,198_3,P,cd,,Yeah woh hua bahut hi overload mere par ke upar padega.
4,"So you're working full time part time study, and then you've got your wedding preparations.",symp/reasoning,198_4,T,irq,,"तो तू पूर्ण समय पार्ट टाइम अध्ययन कर रहा है, और फिर तुझे अपनी श"
5,"Yeah, just got engaged and weddings just a month away now. So yeah, so just got so much happening. Work is really demanding. Yeah, I just found this exam. It's just, yeah. All too much. ",symp/reasoning,198_5,P,id,,"Haan, abhi dil se haan kar karva li hai aur shaadi bas ek mahine baad hai. Toh haan, bohot kuch ho raha hai. Kaam bilkul kaabil-e-taareef hai. Haan, maine yeh exam abhi paaya hai. Yeh sab toh zyada ho raha hai."
6,So Imagin you've been sweating on this for a while and it's all been swirling around in your head,symp/reasoning,198_6,T,gc,,"Toh imagine karo, aap iss par bahut ghanton se pasine bahate hue kaam kar rahe ho aur yeh sab aapke dimaag mein ghum raha hai."
7,"just been building up and so much pressure with everything and I'm living at home so my parents You know, a lot of pressure need to do everything right. And, and by failing this, I feel like I've just embarrassed them and disappointed them and I just don't feel like I'm good enough to go on Studying.",symp/reasoning,198_7,P,gc,,"Mujhe bas badh rahi hai aur bahut pareshani hai har cheez se aur mai abhi ghar pe reh rahi hu toh mere mummy-papa ko bhi bahut pressure hai ki mein sab sahi karo. Aur, yeh fail karke, mujhe aisa lagta hai ki maine unhe sharminda kiya aur unhe nirash kiya hai aur mujhe lagta hai ki main padhai mein aage jaane layak nahi hu."
8,Okay. And have they said much to you about filing exam?,inactive,198_8,T,irq,,Theek hai. Aur kya unhone aapko exam ki file ke baare mein bahut kaha hai?
9,"They haven't said much. I was really scared to tell them actually because I knew they just be so disappointed and disinterest by the fact that I did fail. Yeah, I've never failed anything before. And so Yes. Really hard.",symp/reasoning,198_9,P,id,,"Woh bohot kuch nahi bole. Actually mujhe unhe bataane se bohot dar laga kyunki mujhe pata tha ki woh bahut nirash aur akarshith honge jab main fail hua hoon. Haan, maine kabhi pehle kisi cheez me fail nahi kiya hai. Aur haan. Bohot mushkil tha."
10,Yeah. So it's new and you don't like it at all?,inactive,198_10,T,irq,,Haan. Toh yeh naya hai aur tujhe bilkul pasand nahi?
11,Not at all. I think leaving uni will just be the way out just so I don't have to go through it again.,symp/reasoning,198_11,P,id,,Bilkul nahi. Mujhe lagta hai ki uni chhod dena hi bahar ka raasta hoga taki mujhe usse dobara nahi guzarna pade.
12,"Okay, well, I'm glad you've come to counseling, because it's good for us to get an outsider's opinion when we've got so much on our plate, and we confused as to what to do and our emotions can get in the way. And you just said earlier that a whole lot of stuffs on your plate at the moment. Okay. So I'm glad you've come here. Here with the clinic We use the ABC model, which is a cognitive behavioral therapy model. So Marsha, some counselors have put together a list of beliefs that we often use. And we don't realize that we're using those beliefs and they tend to be faulty ones. Here's the least here. Have a look through that to see if there are any beliefs that you might be operating on at the moment.",routine,198_12,T,gc,,"Thik hai, chalo, mujhe achcha laga ki tum counseling ke liye aaye ho, kyunki humare paas bohot saare kaam hai aur hum confuse bhi hain aur hum emotions mein bhi uljh jaate hain. Aur tumne abhi bola ki bohot saari cheezein tumhare plate par hain. Thik hai. To main khush hoon ki tum yahaan aaye ho. Yahaan clinic mein hum ABC model ka prayog karte hain, jo ek cognitive behavioral therapy model hai. Isliye Marsha, kuch counselors ne akhbaar mein jo beliefs hain uski list taiyaar ki hai. Aur hum realize bhi nahi karte ki hum uss beliefs ka istemaal kar rahe hain, aur woh kaafi kharab bhi ho sakte hain. To yahaan se dekh lo, kahi aisi beliefs toh nahi hain jo tum abhi istemaal kar rahe ho."
13,"I think number two,",inactive,198_13,P,id,,Mujhe lagta hai do number hai.
14,okay. Read that one out for me,inactive,198_14,T,ci,,okay. Mujhe wo padhke suna do na.
15,that it's necessary to have a high degree of uncertainty in order to be happy and perform well.,routine,198_15,P,cr,,उसको खुश रहने और अच्छा प्रदर्शन करने के लिए अधिकतम अनिश्चितता होने की आवश्यकता ह
16,Yeah. You mentioned that,inactive,198_16,T,ack,,Haan. Tumne yaad kiya tha ki...
17,Number 4 that it's necessary to be competent and successful in all those things which are attempted.,routine,198_17,P,id,,Number 4 यह ज़रूरी है कि सभी उन क़ामयाबी प्राप्त हों जिन्हें हम कोशिश करते हैं।
18,"Hmm yeah, that's an expectation from your family. ",inactive,198_18,T,ack,,"Hmm haan, yeh tere parivar ki ek ummeed hai."
19,Yeah. Possibly number eight. That loss should be entirely pleasant ending And enjoyable that any frustration discomfortable pain would be unbearable.,routine,198_19,P,id,,Haan. Shayed number eight. Woh haar puri tarah se sukhad khatam honi chahiye. Aur maza hi maza hoga ki kisi bhi besari ya takleef ki ghabrahat ka koi bhi dard sahna asahniya hoga.
20,Hmm. Yeah. Which one of those stands out the most for you at the moment?,inactive,198_20,T,irq,,Hmm. Haan. Tumhare liye ab sabse zyada kaun dikhta hai?
21,Umm probabily number 4. Yeah.,inactive,198_21,P,id,,"Umm to #4. Yeah, pata nahi."
22,"How would you put that, in your own words?",inactive,198_22,T,irq,,"Aap kaise daaloge, apne apne shabdon mein?"
23,That I need to be successful all the time andeverything that I do.,inactive,198_23,P,id,,Main chahta hoon ki main hamesha safal ho jao aur sab kuch jo main karta hoon.
24,Hmm.,inactive,198_24,T,ack,,Hmm.
25,Yeah.,inactive,198_25,P,ack,,Haan.
26,And is that different from what's happening in your life at the moment?,inactive,198_26,T,irq,,"Aur kya ye mumkin hai ki aapki jindagi mein abhi jo ho raha hai, kya wo alag hai?"
27,"Well, failing that exam I mean, I wasn't successful with that. So yeah, it just throws out I guess even number two, because throw that all the order in my life. I'd need to have everything. I need to know what I'm doing where I'm going. Yes.",story,198_27,P,id,,"Accha, exam toh fail hogaya tha, matlab, mujhe wo success nahi mila thi. Haan, samajh mein aata hai, ki thoda sa number do toh bhi nahi chala, kyonki usne phir se meri life mein sabki taraf se ghaav diya. Mujhe sab kuch chahiye tha. Main sab kuch hona chahiye tha, jaanna chahiye tha ki main kya kar raha hoon, kahan ja raha hoon. Haan."
28,"Okay, so if number four is an expectation that your family has given that you have of yourself How do you measure up next to number four?",routine,198_28,T,irq,,"Theek hai, agar number chaar ek aasaami hai jo tumhare parivaar ne diya hai kyonki tum khud ki ummeed rakhte ho Toh number chaar ke saamne tumhara kaisa khada ho?"
29,I don't feel like I'm good enough.,symp/reasoning,198_29,P,id,,Mujhe lagta hai ki main acchi tarah se kamyaab nahi hoon.
30,"Okay. All right. Well, what I'd like to do is, is put some of those ideas on the board under the ABC. And I'll explain as we go along. ",routine,198_30,T,gc,,"Thik hai. Baaki sab teek hai. Acha, main jo karna chahta hu, vo hai ki, main kuch uss khayalat ko board par ABC ke neeche likhu. Aur main tumhe samjhata rahunga jab tak hum age badte hai."
31,Okay.,inactive,198_31,P,ack,,Okay.
32,Okay. So what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment?,inactive,198_32,T,irq,,Theek hai. Toh tu kya samajh raha hai ki tere liye abhi moment mein trigger point kya ho sakta hai ya activating event kya ho sakta hai?
33,"I mean, there are a lot of things, but I think, obviously filing the exam was the main one.",,198_33,P,id,,"Main baat toh ye hai ki bahut saari cheezein hain, par main toh sochta hoon ki obviously exam ko file karna hi sabse bada kaam tha."
34,"All right. And, and the consequences, you thinking of leaving uni. And, and that statement you made earlier about? Yeah, that's, that's the one. That's the crucial one, and I'll explain it shortly when I get up to the board. ",routine,198_34,T,gc,,"Theek hai. Aur, aur sazaayein, tu university chhodne ki soch raha hai. Aur, aur wo statement jise tune pehle kiya tha? Haan, wahi. Wahi woh maamuli nahi, aur main abhi bataunga jab main board ke paas pahunchunga."
35,Okay.,inactive,198_35,P,ack,,Thik hai
36,"Okay, I think I'll put it up there now for you so we can work through that. So Marsha, the activating event, which is what you stated earlier And the kind of decision that you're thinking about is ",routine,198_36,T,gc,,"Arama, aaram se socho toh main use vahan aapke liye rakh doon, jisse hum saath mein kaam kar sakte hain. Toh Marsha, woh pravartak ghatna, joh aapne pehle kaha tha aur woh prakar ka faisla joh aap soch rahe hain woh hai..."
37,leaving Uni?,inactive,198_37,P,crq,,Leave kar raha hai tu University se
38,That's right okay. So it's important that we consider the jump from here over to here. And the kind of thinking that you've been swirling around in your head affects the consequence. And you've mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit. And you put that in your own words. What are your words before?,routine,198_38,T,cd,,"Woh sahi hai theek hai. Toh yeh zaroori hai ki hum isse yahan se wahan tak ka jump dhyaan mein rakhein. Aur woh tarah ka soch jo aapke dimaag mein ghoom rahi hai, woh parinaam par asar dalti hai. Aur aapne pehle bhi kaha tha ki number chaar sahi lagta hai. Aur aapne khud ke shabdon mein kaha hai. Aapke shabde kya hain pehle se pehle?"
39,That I'm not good enough.,inactive,198_39,P,id,,"- ""Mai thik se kaafi acha nahi hun."""
40,"It's really important for us to consider that kind of thinking, hmm. Okay, Marsha, it's good that we've got those things on the board. And what I'd like to do now is focus, stepping out a bit from your situation and looking, looking at it from another point of view. To me, it sounds like you've, you're doing a whole lot of things really well. Can you list all of the things that you're doing really well?",routine,198_40,T,id,,"Yeh humare liye bahut zaruri hai ki hum uss tarah ka soch le, hmm. Thik hai, Marsha, accha hai ki humare paas board pe woh sab cheezein hai. Aur ab main jo karna chahta hu hai dhyan se dekhna, apni situation se thoda bahar nikalte hue aur usse doosre angle se dekhna. Mujhe lagta hai ki aap bahut saari cheezein bahut achhe se kar rahe ho. Kya aap mujhe sab cheezein bata sakte hai jo aap bahut achhe se kar rahe ho?"
41,"I'm working, It's a really demanding job, You know, keeping up with it. I guess. Things that my fiance I mean, we're engaged. So planning the wedding That's going really well. It's stressful, but it's going well.",story,198_41,P,id,,"Main kaam kar rahi hun, Isse bahut hi mushkil kaam hai, Tu janta hai, uske saath sambhaalna. Shayaad. Woh cheezein jo mere fiance ab aap samajh gaye honge, hum sagai kar chuke hain. To shaadi ka intezam Yeh bahut accha ho raha hai. Thoda stressful hai, lekin accha ho raha hai."
42,And all of you other university subjects?,story,198_42,T,crq,,Aur tum sabhi ke paas aur koi prakriti vishay hai?
43,"Yeah. never sold anything before. This is the first time I guess all the other subjects? Yeah, yeah.",story,198_43,P,cd,,"Haan. Kabhi kuchh becha nahi hai. Ye pehli baar hai mujhe lagta hai sabhi doosre vishay? Haan, haan."
44,And you're succeeding in all of those things together?,story,198_44,T,yq,,Aur tum sab cheezon mein ek saath safal ho rahe ho?
45,Yeah.,inactive,198_45,P,ack,,Haan.
46,You're juggling it. And it's a lot on your plate at the moment. But it sounds like you've been able to cope up until this point of the one exam.,story,198_46,T,crq,,Tum use juggling kar rahe ho. Aur yeh moment mein aapke plate mein kaafi hai. Lekin aisa lagta hai ki aapne is ek exam ke point tak handle kar liya hai.
47,Yeah. This one just threw me off balance. just failing.,symp/reasoning,198_47,P,cd,,Haan. Yeh ek ne mujhe off balance kar diya. Sirf fail ho raha hai.
48,"So, would you describe yourself as successful most of the time?",inactive,198_48,T,irq,,"Kya, kya aap apne aapko jyadatar samay safal ke roop me varnan kar sakte hain?"
49,"Yeah, Most of the time",inactive,198_49,P,id,,"Haan, Jyadatar samay toh"
50,Yeah. And what's the evidence for that?,inactive,198_50,T,irq,,Haan. Aur usske liye saboot kya hai?
51,passing all my fans all the time. I'm just passing my subjects not getting that full time job. It's a great job that I'm doing. I'm getting married.,story,198_51,P,id,,"Sabhi mere sare fans se guzar raha hun. Main sirf apne subjects pass kar raha hun, par mujhe wo pura waqt naukri nahi mil rahi hai. Ye ek bahut acchi naukri hai jo main kar raha hun. Main shadi kar raha hun."
52,"Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So how do all of those successes compared to that belief that you've written that I've written on the board for you?",routine,198_52,T,irq,,"Haan, yeh sahi hai. Haan. Toh us sab successes ko us vishvaas ke saath kaise compare kiya jaaye, jis par maine aapke liye board par likha tha aur jis par aapne likha tha?"
53,"I guess in comparison, I am good enough.",inactive,198_53,P,id,,"Main mauj badi hai, main kafi achha hoon."
54,"Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And all the evidence is there. All of the subjects that you've passed in first year, and now second year. year round, full time job. That's a success. Yeah, it's great. Yeah. Good. Okay. Well, what I'd like to do is get you to write that on the board to dispute that belief. Okay. Yeah. Would you do that?",routine,198_54,T,ack,,"Haan, yeh sahi hai. Haan. Aur sab saboot hai yahaan. Saare subjects jo tumne pehle saal mein clear kiye hain, ab second saal mein bhi. Saari saal, poore din kaam. Yeh hai safalta. Haan, yeh ekdam mast hai. Haan. Accha. Thik hai. Toh main tumhe yeh karne ke liye keh raha hu ki tum us vishwaas ko rokne ke liye board par likho. Thik hai. Haan. Kya tum karoge?"
55,Alright,inactive,198_55,P,gc,,Thik hai
56,Well done last That's a powerful statement. What kind of decision goes along with that?,routine,198_56,T,irq,,बढ़िया किया आपने पिछले का वह एक शक्तिशाली बयान है। इसके साथ कौनस
57,Staying at uni.,symp/reasoning,198_57,P,id,,Uni pe rehna.
58,Good. Okay. Knock that on the board first.,inactive,198_58,T,gc,,Theek ho. Thik hai. Pehle usko board par knock kardo.
59,Okay,inactive,198_59,P,ack,,ठी
60,"Alright, that's good. Good. Okay. So you've made a bit of a decision, haven't you?",routine,198_60,T,yq,,"Thik hai, yeh toh achha hai. Achha. Theek hai. Toh tumne thoda sa faisla kiya hai, kya nahi?"
61,Yeah.,inactive,198_61,P,ack,,Haan.
62,Okay. Tell me about it. Does it feel like okay?,inactive,198_62,T,irq,,Theek hai. Mujhe iske baare mein batao. Kya ye theek lagta hai?
63,Yeah. I feel like I should stay.,inactive,198_63,P,id,,Haan. Mujhe lagta hai main rukna chahiye.
64,Okay. Why is that?,inactive,198_64,T,irq,,ठीक है। वो क्यों
65,"I can try again. Everything doesn't have to be 100% all the time. Good. Good. Yeah, I mean, I could reset the exam. ",routine,198_65,P,id,,"Main kar sakta hu phir se. Sab cheezo ka hona 100% nahi zaruri hai hamesha. Achha. Achha. Haan, matlab main exam reset kar sakta hu."
66,"Okay, yeah. Yeah. And we've talked about all your successes. Yeah. So it's hard now to believe that top statement that I'm not good enough.",routine,198_66,T,gc,,"Okay, haan. Haan. Aur hamne tere sabhi safaltaon ke baare mein baat ki hai. Haan. Isliye ab yeh mushkil hai ki main woh peeche wala keh raha hu jo ki main bahut hi kamzor hoon."
67,"Yeah, I mean, I am good enough compared to all the things that you helped me realize with all the successes that I've had that I am good enough. Yeah. Good.",routine,198_67,P,gc,,"Haan, mujhe mtlab hai, mai tere dwaara mujhe smjhane se jo baatein realize huee un sabse tulna mein kaafi acha hoon. Haan, acha."
68,"Okay. And so, this idea about staying at uni.",symp/reasoning,198_68,T,crq,,"Haan. Aur isliye, yeh vichaar uni mein rahne ka."
69,"Yeah I will stay. I am good enough. So I'm sure I can give it another go and see how it go from there. I can reset the exam, and I'm sure I'll be fine.",routine,198_69,P,cd,,"Haan main rahunga. Mujhe kaafi accha lagta hai. Toh main pakka dobara try kar sakta hoon aur dekh sakta hoon ki kya hota hai. Main pariksha ko punah shuru kar sakta hoon, aur main pakka thik rahunga."
70,"Okay, good. Okay. What I'd like you to do is to keep saying that statement. I am good enough to say it in front of the mirror two or three times a day, so that you build up your confidence, because it's going to take some time to reprogram you confuse it or up here with that kind of positive belief of about yourself, rather than carrying around that other belief. And we tend to carry those other beliefs for years and years and years. And so it's going to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief system. But you've made a great start here today. So congratulations.",routine,198_70,T,id,,"Okay, good. Thik hai. What I'd like you to do is to keep saying that statement. Main chahta hu ki tum us vaakya ko baar-baar bole. Main khud aaine ke saamne use do ya teen baar ek din mein kehne mein saksham hu, taki tumhari himmat badhe, kyunki tumhara dimag doosre belief se confuse ho jata hai, jabki tumhare dil mein khud ke baare mein hota hai. Isse apna positive vishwas rakhna zada mushkil nahi hoga. Aur hum generally saalon-taron se ye beliefs apne saath liye rakhte hai. Isliye tumhari taraf se thodi mehnat karni padegi tumhare vichar aur belief system ko consciously badalne ke liye. Lekin aaj ke din se tumne ek achha shuruat ki hai. To badhai ho."
