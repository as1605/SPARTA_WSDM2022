2,Not too good?,inactive,153_2,T,crq,0.0,Thoda sa theek?
3,"Yeah. So something happened over this past week I was I was driving to my buddy's house and I forgot that my tags for my car is  expired earlier this month. So I got pulled over for that and then I don't know why I did this but the cop asked to search my car and I was like, yeah, that's fine like whatever because he said he had two searches. This is getting towed. And I completely forgot that I had my junk bag in the trunk. So we opened the trunk and he was looking through the bag. So he found me he found everything. I had my weed in there at the bottom the pipe like all my pieces. So I got a, I got in trouble for possession. So I just I just want him to court and the judge offered me this decision. He said that I could either do two weeks of community service like about 80 hours, or I could pay $1,000 fine. And I'm trying to I'm really trying to figure out which one really which one would be better I guess, the both kind of suck but",story,153_3,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan. Toh kuch ho gaya is past week main main apne dost ke ghar ja rahe the aur main bhool gaya ki meri gaadi ki tags ki expiration earlier this month hone wali thi. Toh mujhe uske liye pull over kar diya gaya aur phir main iska karan kyun kiya main pata nahi hai, lekin cop ne meri gaadi ko search karne ko kaha aur maine kaha, haan, theek hai, koi baat nahi kyunki usne kaha tha ki uske paas do searches hain. Yeh gaadi ko tow karne ke liye hain. Aur main poori tarah se bhool gaya tha ki trunk main mera kuda bag tha. Toh humne trunk khol diya aur woh bag check kar raha tha. Toh usne mujhe sab kuchh mil gaya. Meri weed ko maine bottom main rakhi thi pipe ke saath, meri saari cheezein thi. Toh mujhe possession ke liye mushkil ka samna karna pada. Toh main bas court jaana chahta tha aur judge ne mujhe yeh decision diya. Usne kaha ki main do hafte ki community service yaani 80 ghante kar sakta hoon, ya phir $1,000 fine de sakta hoon. Aur main yeh decide karne ki koshish kar raha hoon, kaunsa option mujhe better lage. Dono hi thode hi aache hain lekin."
4,"So you're struggling with the decision between two options you perceived as negative, right. ",symp/reasoning,153_4,T,crq,0.0,"Toh tujhe do options mein se ek chunne mein dikkat ho rahi hai jo tujhe negative lag rahe hain, sahi?"
5,Right.,inactive,153_5,P,cd,0.0,Theek hai
6,Now we've discussed the marijuana usage before was just probably the root of this problem. Right?,symp/reasoning,153_6,T,crq,0.0,"Abhi humne pehle hi marijauna ki upyog par baat ki thi aur shayad yeh problem ka mool tha, sahi hai na?"
7,Right.,inactive,153_7,P,cd,0.0,Thik.
8,But it sounds like you didn't really want to explore change this time.,inactive,153_8,T,crq,0.0,Par tumhara toh muje esa hi lag raha hai ki iss baar tum explore karna hi nahi chahte the.
9,"No, I mean, it's it's really not a problem like it's just they don't really want it problem is that I got caught like I'm doing good in school works fine. So obviously like marijuana is other than just going to court It has never been a problem.",story,153_9,P,cd,-1.0,"Nahi, main matlab kar raha tha, yeh itni badi samasya bhi nahi hai, bas unko chahiye hi nahi hai ki main caught ho gaya ki main school mein achha kaam kar raha hu. Lekin dhyaan rakho, marijuana ki cheez pareshani se zyada hai, bas court jaane se issue hai. Kabhi bhi yeh samasya nahi hai."
10,So let's focus on this decision then.,inactive,153_10,T,gc,0.0,Toh chaliye is faisle par focus karte hain phir.
11,Right,inactive,153_11,P,gc,0.0,Right ह
12,so the decision is between a couple weeks of  community service what kind of community service?,inactive,153_12,T,crq,0.0,"Toh faisla hai ki kuch hafte samuday seva ke beech, kaunsi prakar ki samuday seva?"
13,just picking up crap inside of the road?,inactive,153_13,P,cd,0.0,Kya bas sadak ke ander se kachra uthane ki baat kar rahe ho?
14,"Or $1,000 fine?",inactive,153_14,T,crq,0.0,"Kya $1,000 ka jurmana?"
15,Yeah.,inactive,153_15,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
16,And do you have the thousand dollars?,inactive,153_16,T,yq,0.0,Aur tumhare paas hazar dollar hain?
17,"I do, but I have I got a vacation coming up and I definitely like I want to I want to keep the money for like a little little vacation we'd like do some, some fun stuff with my buddies. Definitely like I want to keep that money. But I mean, I also like the community service is like also kind of close to the vacation so I might have to like give up part of the vacation or to to do the two weeks so that I think that didn't really help my decision either.",story,153_17,P,op,-1.0,"Mai to karti hoon, par mere paas ek chhuti ka vikalp hai aur main zarur chahti hoon ki mujhe us paise ko chhota chhota chhutti ke liye rakhe jo mere saathiyo ke saath kuch maze karne ke liye hai. Main zarur chahti hoon ki main wo paisa rakhoon. Par haan, seva samajh seva bhi chhuti ke pass hai, isliye mujhe thoda sa chhuti se haath dhona pad sakta hai taaki do hafte ke liye karoon, isse mere faisla ko asar hoga."
18,"Do you see any value in either one of these options, which is all become negative?",inactive,153_18,T,yq,0.0,"Kya tummein koi bhi vipeshaas dekhne ko milta hai in donon mein se kisi ek mein, jiski sab kuch negatif ho jaati hai?"
19,"I mean, really, like they both they both have the same negative, I guess like, like if I if I do the community service that I like, you know, I do get to keep the money. But I mean other hand, like if I keep the money, I'm doing community service, like I'm not gonna have all the time to spend the money. So it's now I mean, neither really have a positive and both the negatives are kind of equal to so it's it's kind of tough to choose.",symp/reasoning,153_19,P,on,-1.0,"Yaar, I'm saying yaar, both have same negative yaar, I'm guessing yaar, if I do community service that I like yaar, I get to keep the money yaar. But listen, if I keep the money, I'm doing community service yaar, I won't have time to spend it yaar. So now yaar, neither of them have any positives yaar, both negatives are same yaar, so it's like tough to decide yaar."
20,"So let's talk about what's important to try to help you make this decision. Really what you're going to have to determine is, and what I want to explore is the importance of keeping the money. Right, because that's really what this comes down to. ",routine,153_20,T,gc,0.0,"Isliye chalo hum baat karte hain ke kya hai jo zaruri hai aapki madad karne mein aapki is faisle ko lene mein. Sach mein, aapko faisla karna hoga ke, aur main janna chahta hoon, paise rakhna kitna zaruri hai. Sahi baat toh yeh hi hai."
21,Right.,inactive,153_21,P,gc,0.0,Sahi hai
22,"You You keep it and you do the service, or you spend it and you don't do the service?",routine,153_22,T,crq,0.0,Tum ye rakh lo aur tumse sewa karwana hai ya tum ise kharch karke sewa na karwana?
23,right,inactive,153_23,P,cd,0.0,sahi
24,So you could you could say that it's about the importance of keeping the money rr you could say it's about the importance of avoiding the community service.,symp/reasoning,153_24,T,crq,0.0,Aap aap keh sakte ho ki yeh paise ko rakhna ka mahatva hai ya fir aap keh sakte ho ki yeh samudaay seva se bachna ka mahatva hai.
25,Right.,inactive,153_25,P,cd,0.0,Theek hai
26,"So let's talk a little about that. What How would you say on a scale of one to 10, where 10 is very important. How would you scale keeping the money?",routine,153_26,T,irq,0.0,"So chalo uske baare mein thoda baat karte hain. Ek se dus tak ka scale dekh kar bataye, kahaan tak important hai. Paise rakhne ko scale kaise karoge?"
27,"I mean, that's obviously pretty high. Like, I guess keeping the money, it'd be like a nine. Because if I, like if I, if I keep the money, obviously, I can, like use it for other other things. I'd say probably nine. ",routine,153_27,P,id,0.0,"Mere matlab, yeh toh bilkul zyada hai. Jaise, main samajhti hu ki, paise rakhna, wo toh ek nau jaise hi hoga. Kyunki agar main, jaise main, agar main paise rakhu, toh bilkul, main alag cheezo ke liye uska istemal kar sakti hu. Toh main kahungi shayad nau bahut sahi hoga."
28,"So keeping in mind, that's, that's very important to you. ",inactive,153_28,T,irq,0.0,"इस बात को ध्यान में रखते हुए, ये बहुत ही महत्व"
29,Right.,inactive,153_29,P,id,0.0,Sahi hai
30,So that scenario would be would lean more toward completing the community service.,inactive,153_30,T,irq,0.0,Is scenario mein hum community service poora karne ka zyada taiyaar ho jaayenge.
31,"Right. Yeah, I mean, I guess that's true. Like, I didn't think about it in that way, like if I if I give up the the two weeks of time, like, obviously that would suck, but like I have, I guess I have more of a choice of what to do with money compared to my time. You know, so I guess I could think about it that way maybe",story,153_31,P,id,0.0,"Haan, haan, matlab, mujhe toh yeah lag raha hai ki yeh sahi hai. Jaise maine socha nahi tha uss tarah se, agar main do hafte waqt kharch kar doon, toh obviously yeh bahut bura hoga, par paise ke saath mera zyada choice hai, aur mere waqt ke compare mein. Tum pata hai, toh ho sakta hai main iss tarah sooch saku."
32,"Well, let's look at the other side too. How important is it for you on a scale of one to 10 to avoid the community service? So we know it's a nine, right to keep the money?",routine,153_32,T,irq,0.0,"Achha, hum bhi doosri taraf se dekh lete hain. Kitna zaroori hai aapke liye ek se das tak ki karein nahi karna? Toh hum jaante hain ki ye nau hai, seedhe paise bachaane ke liye?"
33,right.,inactive,153_33,P,id,0.0,thik.
34,How to avoid the community service ?,inactive,153_34,T,irq,0.0,Community service se kaise bach sakte hain?
35,"Maybe like, I guess maybe about a seven because the like the community service, I mean, it wouldn't be that bad. Obviously, like, it would be a waste of time. We're gonna have to do this crap work for for so long, but I don't know. Like, at least I know if I do the community service and it would be like done after this amount of time. You know, so I can I can always keep that in mind.",story,153_35,P,id,0.0,"Maybe, I think around a seven because of the community service, yaar. I mean, it won't be that bad. Of course, it'll be a waste of time. We'll have to do this boring work for so long, but I don't know. At least if I do the community service, it'll be over after this much time. So, I can always keep that in mind."
36,"So, as you're talking, it seems like you're leaning toward or maybe you're leaning toward completing the service. Even though you're not happy with either choice, right?",symp/reasoning,153_36,T,crq,0.0,"Toh, jaise tum baat kar rahe ho, lagta hai ki tum iss taraf jhuk rahe ho ya phir tum seva puri karne ki taraf jhuk rahe ho. Halaanki tum dono vikalpon se khush nahi ho, sahi na?"
37,Right,inactive,153_37,P,cd,0.0,Theek hai
38,That might be the least objectionable.,inactive,153_38,T,gc,0.0,वो संभवत: सबसे कम आपत्तिज
39,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I guess cuz I never like I never thought about scaling it like that way. So yeah, I think so. ",inactive,153_39,P,gc,1.0,"Haan, haan. Haan, mujhe lagta hai kyuki main kabhi bhi usko usi tarah se scale karna socha nahi. Toh haan, mujhe lagta hai."
40,When do you have to make this decision by ?,inactive,153_40,T,irq,0.0,Tumhe yeh faisle ko lena kab tak karna hoga?
41,"by the end of the week So today's Tuesday, so I have like a couple of days to think it over.",inactive,153_41,P,id,0.0,"Hafte ke ant tak Toh aaj hai Tuesday, toh mere paas kuch din hain sochne ke liye."

43,"on Friday, yeah. When I get the decision.",inactive,153_43,P,gc,0.0,"Friday ko, Haan. Jab main decision milti hai."

Patient went under possession the sent to the court and charged a $1000 fine or community service of 80 hours. Patient was confused between selecting either of the options. Therapist got to know that marijuana is the root of this problem. Patient was doing school work fine, so patient thought that marijuana is just a thing that made to go to court. Therapist asked to patient choose either of the options between a $1000 fine or Community service of 80 hrs. Therapist asked to scale both options from 1 to 10. Patient was planning for a vacation but patient wasn't ready give 2 weeks for community services. Then the patient scaled money 9 out 10 and community services 7 out of 10. Therapist asked to take a decision by the end of the week and choose the right option for you.",,,,,
