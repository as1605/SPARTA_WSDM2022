1,I'm pretty good. How are you Dr. Grande ?,inactive,154_1,P,gt,0.0,"Main thik hoon. Aap kaise ho, Dr. Grande?"
2,I'm doing I'm doing well thanks for asking. What's been going on?,inactive,154_2,T,gt,0.0,"""Hum kar raha hoon aur tu kaisa kar raha hai, shukriya poochne ke liye. Kya chal raha hai?"""
3,"Um, so I've, I've been applying to doctor programs for this upcoming fall. And I'm like, I'm kind of stuck because I got into two of the schools that that I was looking at. I get and like I got into both of them and both of their programs are really good. Both of them have like great research track records and kind of what I want to do. ",story,154_3,P,id,-1.0,"Um, toh maine doctorate programs ke liye is aane waale autumn mein apply kar diya hai. Aur main thodi si phansi hui hoon kyunki mujhe do colleges mein admission mila hai jahaan maine dekha tha. Aur mujhe dono mein se admission mil gaya hai aur dono ke programs bahut acche hain. Dono ka research track record bahut accha hai aur yeh woh kuch hai jo main karna chahti hoon."

5,"And yeah, but the problem is is like I don't know how to decide between the two now.",symp/reasoning,154_5,P,gc,-1.0,"Haan, par problem yeh hai ki ab mujhe yeh faisla kaise karna hai ki dono ke beech mein kya farak hai."
6,"Okay, So you, you applied to two places, and you got them both. ",symp/reasoning,154_6,T,crq,0.0,"Okay, to me, you applied to two jagahs, aur tum dono ko le liye."
7,Hmm,inactive,154_7,P,cd,0.0,ह्म
8,It sounds like both have programs that are really well suited to what you want to do?,inactive,154_8,T,yq,0.0,Yeh dono ke program lagta hai ki woh tumhare kaam ke liye bilkul sahi hain?
9,Right.,inactive,154_9,P,op,0.0,Thik hai
10,And you're having difficulty deciding which one to go with.,symp/reasoning,154_10,T,irq,0.0,Aur tumhe sahi rasta chunne mein mushkil ho rahi hai ki kis ek ke saath jaana chahiye.
11,"Yeah. Um, yeah, like I've always I've always had trouble, like, within decisiveness and it's like, when I, when I had two choices of something that's very similar, like I always I always get stuck. And I like, it's very hard for me to actually like make a decision",symp/reasoning,154_11,P,id,-1.0,"Haan. Um, haan, jaise ki main hamesha se confushion se do chunautiyon ke beech hoon, aur jab main, jaisa ki main hamesha se karta hoon, do chizon mein se kisi ek ka chayan karna hota hai jo bahut hi saman hoti hai, toh main hamesha phass jaata hoon. Aur mujhe pasand hai, ki meri taraf se faisla lena bahut hi mushkil hota hai."
12,"Let's are start to the beginning. You definitely want to go on for a PhD. Okay, so we've established that",story,154_12,T,gc,0.0,"Chalo, hum shuru karein to shuruvaat par. Tum zaroor PhD ke liye jaana chahte ho. Theek hai, to humne ye tay kar liya hai."
13,right.,inactive,154_13,P,gc,0.0,thik.
14,"So it's going to be one of these programs either way. So really, the only question you're really left with is which one? ",symp/reasoning,154_14,T,crq,0.0,"Toh yeh ek aise program ka hona hai jisme se koi ek hoga. Toh asal mein, wahi sawaal hai jiske saath aap bache hue hai ki kaunsa ek?"
15,Yeah.,inactive,154_15,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
16,"So oftentimes, these situations we look at pros and cons, right? Are there any? Well, it sounds like there's a lot of pros to each one. Are there any cons to the one ?",routine,154_16,T,irq,0.0,"Aksar baar, ham in haalaat ke liye faayde aur nuksaan dekhte hain, na?
Koi hain kya? Acha, jaise ki lagta hain ki har ek kaafi fayeda hai.
Kya koi nuksaan hain iss pe?"
17,"I mean, really not, not any that I can think of like, I've tried to, like, I've tried to write them down the piece of paper, do the pros and cons and like the pros look very close. And it's like the same number, but I mean, both programs are good. I have connections with like the some of the teachers and both of them. They're both in the same city. Like they're really close to each other. They're, they're both very similar, but like, for some reason, I just, I don't know, it would be easier if there's like some cons to one of them",story,154_17,P,id,-1.0,"I mean, sacchi mein nahi, koi aisa jo mujhe yaad aaye, maine koshish ki, jaise ki, maine koshish ki unhe kagaz ke tukdon par likhna, pro aur cons ko karna aur pro bahut karibi dikh rahe hain. Aur waise hi same number hai, lekin yani dono programs achhe hain. Mere kuch teachers se connection hain, dono mein se kuch, wo bhi same sheher mein hain. Jaise ki bahut karibi hain dono aur bahut similar bhi hain, lekin kisi wajah se, mujhe lagta hai ki agar koi ek ke cons hote toh kaam asaan ho jaata."
18,It will make the decision easier if you had some negatives that for one of the programs,routine,154_18,T,gc,0.0,"Yeh faisle aasaan ho jayenge agar aapke paas kuch negatives hote, ek program ke liye."
19,right,inactive,154_19,P,gc,0.0,saheb
20,"there for the other one. So in a way, you know, I guess this we call quote unquote, good problem",routine,154_20,T,gc,0.0,"Toh dusri cheez ke liye. Toh ek tarah se, tum jaante ho, main samajh raha hun ki hum isko quote unquote, achha problem kahte hain."
21,right,inactive,154_21,P,gc,,ठी
22,"It's a problem, but you're choosing between two alternatives that are both really positive for you, but it's there is a choice, right? It's still tough. And you mentioned before that you had some, in your past you're indecisive. ",symp/reasoning,154_22,T,gc,0.0,"It's a problem yaar, lekin tu do options ke beech choose kar raha hai jisme dono hi bohot acche tere liye, lekin ik choice toh hai na? Fir bhi mushkil hai. Aur pehle tune bola tha ki tune past mein thoda hi kar matlab tu indecisive hai."
23,Yeah.,inactive,154_23,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
24,"So maybe we can do in this process is help you build decision making skills or contribute to that ability. Because whichever whichever program you get into where you choose, you're gonna have to make decisions later on to ",routine,154_24,T,gc,0.0,"Toh shayad hum iss process mein tumhe decision making skills banane mein madad kar sakte hai ya uss kshamta mein yogdan de sakte hai. Kyunki jis bhi program mein tum dakhila lete ho, waha baad mein tumhe decisions leni padegi."
25,right,inactive,154_25,P,gc,0.0,Correct waala
26,"and probably vary, or maybe some of those will be easier, maybe some of those choices won't be as easy. So I think this would be a matter of looking at what's important to you. But you mentioned the research agenda already, or agendas at both universities, that's important, too",routine,154_26,T,gc,0.0,"Aur shayad thoda sa antar hoga, ya shayad kuch chunav aasaan honge, shayad kuch chunav mushkil nahi honge. Toh main sochta hoon ke yeh aapke liye kya mahatvapurn hai dekhte hain. Par aapne pehle se hi research ka agenda ya dono vishvavidyalayon ke agenda ke baare me baat ki hai, yeh bhi mahatvapurn hai."
27,right,inactive,154_27,P,gc,0.0,सही
28,"What are the aspects and maybe not so much thinking about these two universities, but in general, if you had to rank order them, what aspects are really the most important?",routine,154_28,T,irq,0.0,"Yeh dono universities ke baare mein soch kar bahut kam tu sahi hain, par agar tu unko rank karne par dhyan dena, toh sabse mahatvapurna aspects kaun se hote hain?"
29,"Um, well, definitely, the research is up there. I definitely want to get that out of out of whichever school I go to. I think something else that's important is for the university to have kind of like maybe a post doctorate plan, whether they have connections with, like businesses where I can get a job like right after graduate or, like if I was going to move into a faculty position, like if they kind of had a pathway that would help set me up for that like that. Those are probably the biggest, like the biggest influencers,",story,154_29,P,id,0.0,"Um, well, zaroor, research hai upar wala. Mujhe definitely out of whichever school I go to se usko nikalna hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki aur koi important baat hai ke university ke paas ek tarah ka post doctorate plan ho, jahaan humare paas koi connection ho, jaise businesses jahaan main job immediately after graduation mil sakti hai ya phir agar main faculty position mein jaana chahti hu to kya unke paas aisi pathway hogi jo mujhe prepare kar sake. Ye sab shayad sabse bade influencers hai."
30,"The research and not a guarantee, necessarily, but some high probability employment?",inactive,154_30,T,crq,0.0,"Kya research hai aur na koi guarantee hai, zaruri toh nahi, lekin kuch zyada se zyada chances hai ki employment milega?"
31,right.,inactive,154_31,P,cd,0.0,thik.
32,"So really what we could do here, if you want to look at these two universities, even though we don't really have any negatives to look at, we can rank these positives. So it sounds like both have the research that you're looking for that ",routine,154_32,T,gc,0.0,"Actually yadi hum dekhte hai toh hum in do universities ko dekh sakte hai, haalanki humein koi bure points dekhne ke liye hai hi nahi, par hum in achhaiyon ko rank kar sakte hai. Toh lagta hai ki dono mein se dono ke paas woh research hai jo aap dhoondh rahe hai."

34,"they're both there. But if you could rank and maybe you don't have this information right now, but if you could rank them in terms of the next most important aspect, which is really how hard Will you work to find a job? ",routine,154_34,T,irq,0.0,"Unko dono hain. Lekin agar tum unhe rank kar sakte ho aur shayad abhi tumhare paas yeh jaankari na ho, lekin agar tum unhe next most important aspect ke hisaab se rank kar sakte ho, jo hai ki tum kaam dhundhne ke liye kitna jyada mehnat karoge?"

36,"That's, that's kind of what you're saying. ",inactive,154_36,T,gc,0.0,"Yeh toh, yeh toh aise hi hai jo tum keh rahe ho."
37,"Okay, right. ",inactive,154_37,P,gc,0.0,"Theek, theek."
38,"I mean, it sounds like what you're saying?",inactive,154_38,T,gc,0.0,Mera matalab ye hai ki tum kya keh rahe ho?
39,right,inactive,154_39,P,gc,0.0,सही
40,"So, do you have any information? Or is that something you can find?",inactive,154_40,T,irq,0.0,"सुनो, क्या तुम्हारे पास कोई जानकारी है? या वह कुछ ऐसा है ज"
41,"Um, actually, that's I never thought about like that. Like, I guess I could go online and kind of look at a lot of times universities put up like job acceptance rates like afterwards and they put up percentages, kind of like what what people do afterwards. So maybe if I looked at the websites and kind of found information and see like, how many of them go on to be professors or like work in the industry, maybe maybe I should check that out. That might help me",story,154_41,P,id,9.0,"Um, actual mein, maine kabhi aisa nahi socha tha. Jaise ki, mujhe lagta hai ki main online jaake dekh sakta hu aur bahut saari baar universities job acceptance rates ke baare mein daalte hai baad mein aur percentage bhi daal dete hai, waise hi jaise log apne baad mein karte hai. Toh shayad agar main websites dekhu aur information khoju toh pata chal jayega ki unme se kitne log professors bante hai ya fir industry mein kaam karte hai, shayad main woh dekh lu. Mujhe yeh madad kar sakti hai."
42,"that might allow you to have a difference between them because right now, it's like they're just kind of, they're kind of melded together",routine,154_42,T,gc,0.0,"ऐसा हो सकता है कि आपको उन दोनों के बीच अंतर होने दे, क्योंकि अभी तो ऐसा है कि अभी वे बस मिले हुए हैं"

45,right.,inactive,154_45,P,gc,0.0,Theek hai
46,"So maybe this can build a bit of a discrepancy that the gap between them so you can say, Okay, this one, neither one is bad, right? But this one might be a little better for what I want to do. ",routine,154_46,T,gc,0.0,"Toh shayad yeh ek difference banasakta hai ki unke beech ka furqat, iss liye aap keh sakte hain, Theek hai, dono mein se koi bhi bura nahi hai, sahi? Lekin iss mein meri karna chahti hui cheez ke liye thoda behtar ho sakta hai."
47,Okay.,inactive,154_47,P,gc,0.0,Okay.
48,Does that does that kind of make sense?,inactive,154_48,T,yq,0.0,Kya wo thoda sa samajh me aa gaya hai kya?
49,"Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.",inactive,154_49,P,op,0.0,"Haan, woh toh sense karta hai. Haan."
50,"Similarly, as the I think about it, I know whenever I leave speaking with somebody or some situation, that's right, I always think of all the questions I want to ask, right. So when you leave here, you can consider some of the other aspects and like, Think it over like really important to me and try to create that distance between them. So you can look at them as really two separate entities. Another possibility would be to find out this information, maybe talking to representatives from each university. ",routine,154_50,T,gc,0.0,"Ji hods, I think jab mai ise soochta hun, tab mai jaanta hun ki jab mai kisi ke saath bolna chordun ya kisi situation se exit ho, tab sahi h yaar, mai hamesha uss amazing sawaalon ki sochta hun jinhe main poochna chahta hun, theek. Toh jab tum yahan se jaoge, tum kuch aur pehluon ko dhyan mein rakh sakte ho aur usse baat kar sakte ho, samjhe, socho jo mujhe bahut mayne rakhte hain aur us bhed ko banane ki koshish karne ki koshish karo. Phir aap unhe do alag alag entites ki tarah dekh sakte ho. Ek aur avsar ye ho sakta h ki aap is jaankaari ko pata laga sakte ho, shayad har ek university ke wakilon se baat karke."
51,Okay,inactive,154_51,P,gc,0.0,ओक
52,If they may or may not have more information about potential pros and they might even have some cons right now. I'm sure they'll present a plate manner but they can let you know maybe some of the negatives.,routine,154_52,T,gc,0.0,Agar unhe possibility hai toh unke paas potential pros ke baare mein adhik jaankari ho sakti hai aur shayad abhi unke paas kuch cons bhi ho. Main yaqeen hai ki woh aapko tameez se batayenge lekin unhe pata chal sakta hai ki thoda sa negativity bhi ho sakta hai.
53,Okay.,inactive,154_53,P,gc,0.0,Theek hai

57,Okay.,inactive,154_57,P,gc,0.0,Thik h
58,So it sounds like this information gathering would really be your next step.,routine,154_58,T,gc,0.0,Toh aisa lagta hai ki ye jaankari ikattha karna aapki agla kadam hoga.
59,Yeah. Yeah. I never actually thought about ranking the the pros and going from there. So I think that's a good idea. Yeah.,routine,154_59,P,gc,0.0,Haan. Haan. Mujhe kabhi yeh sochna hi nahi padha ki pros ko rank karna aur usse aage badhna hai. Isliye main samajhta hun ki yeh ek achha vichaar hai. Haan.
60,"One of the things that might be helpful to drive is the importance you place on these different aspects, right. So kind of clarify, and we can we meet again, we'll talk about this, but clarify your values and what's important to you.

61,Okay.,inactive,154_61,P,gc,0.0,Thik hai
62,And then that'll help you to kind of rank some of these attributes.,inactive,154_62,T,gc,0.0,Aur phir yeh aapko thodi si madad kar dega in gunvankon mein se kuch ko rank karne mein.
63,"Right. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. ",inactive,154_63,P,ack,0.0,"Theek hai. Thik hai. Haan, vah samajh mein aata hai."

Chalo, chod dete hai wahi pe. Aur agli baar, hum dekhenge jo humne baat ki. Agar tumhare paas koi aur sawaal hai to batao na."

70,summary,"Patient is applying for a doctor programs but is stuck between two schools because both the schools have great research tracks. Patient is not getting which program to choose. The patient always had such kind of trouble in making the decision. Therapist asked to make pros and cons table but both the programs were good, so therapist asked cons of the programs. Patient told the pros are very similar but didn't know about cons that much. Therapist started a process to improve decision making skills of patient. Therapist asked to look at the rank of the universites and list down the general benefits of these two schools like post graduation or placement after the program etc. Therapist also told that rank these universities according to the positive points they have. Therapist asked to collect such information and rank them before the next aspect. Patient got to know that patient could go online and put up job acceptance, then it will show a percentage and how many people got jobs as a professor or in industry. Therapist gave an example like whenever patient talk to a therapist, patient will ask all the questions but while leaving consider only the things according to the aspects. If they may not have more information about pros so they consider negative points of the therapist, likewise it is associated with the universities. Some are positive and some aren't quite as positive. So it will give you a clarity regarding choosing either of the unversities.",,,,,
