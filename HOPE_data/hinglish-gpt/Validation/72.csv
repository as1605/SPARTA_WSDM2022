3,"Again, the year bench record this week is the last last week. It was like, kind of squeaky clean. So how's it been feeling? I'm sure it does. It really does. Yeah. It's been really a process. So that's fantastic. What? Tell me about what's been going on this week?",routine,72_3,T,irq,,"यह बार-बार होने वाली मिलावट में एक हफ्ते की रिकॉर्ड हुई है। ठीक है, मुझे पता है कि तुम्हारा अनुभव इससे सुधारता है। ये वाकई है। हां, इससे संबंधित होने का भावना दर्शाता है। यह वाकई एक क्रिगर है। तो बताओ मुझे, इस हफ्ते में क्य"
4,I had a good conversation.,routine,72_4,P,ack,,Mujhe acchi baat cheet hui.
5,"Yes, I feel good. ",routine,72_5,P,id,,"Haan, mujhe acha lag raha hai."
6,Tell me about it.,routine,72_6,T,irq,,Batao na mujhe uske bare mein.
7,"I just talked with her on the phone. And yeah, it just went really well. And we actually, after that we had a Skype meeting, a Skype meeting last night. Yes, it was. And, yeah, caught up a little bit and kind of talked about some things.",routine,72_7,P,id,,"Mere abhi uss se phone par baat ki hai. Aur haan, wo sach mein kaafi achi ja rahi thi. Aur humne hakikat mein, uske baad raat ko humne Skype meeting ki, ek Skype meeting ki. Haan, wo thi. Aur, haan, thoda sa baatcheet ki aur kuch baaton ke baare mein baat ki."
8,"Great. Yeah. Oh, nice. Nice. happy to hear about that. And then I don't remember I'm trying to think from last time, like any Allen updates or Yeah, nice things going, Okay, good. I'm happy to hear that. And then I guess the other thing that I wanted to, you know, talk with you about I know that we, you know, kind of had mentioned it briefly. But today kind of marks the kind of beginning of that kind of final phase for us like so then over the next, you know, three sessions, we're going to be starting to kind of wrap up our work together. And I've been feeling that way too, because it's like, it's hard to, it's hard to want to bring that up, because it's really, it's been really just great working with you. And so I really don't want to see that come to an end. But I thought one of the things that's really important is maybe just to get us starting to talk about and again, we don't have to do it all today but just at least get a starting to talk about, you know, some of the changes that you've made, things that have gone really well for you. And really maybe kind of recap like how it is that you've gone from like almost like binge eating daily to almost now you're not at all and kind of, maybe we can kind of talk about how that's gone. Because I think the other thing that's really important is not only the things that you've done in terms of like, how things have gotten better for you, but I also want us to start thinking about to like, okay, what's going to happen when we, you know, kind of get to the end of our work together and, you know, beyond so like in terms of like, how will kind of how you will kind of keep the work going. And so, I've kind of thought, you know, like, I feel like, I'm kind of being like a wet blanket here. You've had a really great week, and now I'm bringing up our kind of departure. But I think it's really important to kind of mark that mark that transition, and also to market to by having, you know, things go so well. I think it's really important. So I guess the first thing I want to talk about is, I guess I'm pointing my my pad of paper because it's like it's so filled with just all the different things that have occurred for you, you know, over the last several weeks, and I think the first thing that's really notable to me is I really, really appreciated your willingness to engage your mom because I know that that's been so hard for you. And it's been so painful, you know, the way that she's treated you in the past. But that you know, I guess I'm even getting kind of emotional talking about because it just been so rich, the transition you've made in terms of the way you've engaged in a more genuine way and allowed her kind of back into your life and it seems like that that's been, you know, really vital to your you know, like getting better.  So what what's you know, in terms of like, from your perspective, kind of what's that been like for you? ",story,72_8,T,irq,,"Great. Haan. Acha hai. Acha hai. sun kar khushi hui. Aur phir main yaad nahi aa raha hoon, mujhe gulo bhai ki updates yaa acha hote hue nahi ya nahi, par thik hai, khushi hai ki sun rahi hoon. Aur phir mujhe lagta hai ki, main aap ke saath baat karna chahta tha, mujhe pata hai ki, maine aap ke saath baat ki thi bas. Lekin, aaj se hamare hamaare saath saath hamare kaam ki tulna se mera shuruvaat hai aur hamare kaam ki tulna se hamare kaam ki tulna se mein rah chuke hai. Aur mujhe yeh bhi aattaa hai kyoki, yae bahut hi achaa kaam hai aur ham saath kaam kar rahi hai. Aur main yeh dekhna chahta hoon ki aapne kitni badhaayi ki hai, kahin na kahin aap bahut hi achaa kiya hai. Aur mein nahi chahta ki hamare kaam ke ant mein aap hamare kaam kiya hai, lekin mein nahi chahta ki, shuruvaat mein bahut hi badi badhaayi ko yaad kiya jaye. Lekin aaj main aapke saath naraz lag raha hoon. Lekin hamare bich mein aaj, shuruvaat ke baad bhi aapke badle hamar badle mein bataaun ki aapke badle kaise kiya.
 Main samajhta hoon ki, hamare saath is kaam ko asaani se aise mamal kiya hai. Aur main sochta hoon ki mein mai kar sakta hoon ki jitne bhi badle jitne bhi hamare saath kaam ho sakta hai.uske baad bhi hamare bich mein bhi sab acha hoga. Aur main sochta hoon ki, agar aapke badle hamari tarah bana sakta hoon, to ise awaaz suniye. Lekin, hamare saath aaj mein hi tujh. Usme laga hoon ki aapke mamuli badle pehle bhi par baad mein bhi aapke liye. Aur main sochta hoon ki aapne kaise kiya hai, aur jab ki badale se rahi ho, tab tak maine aapke liye badle ke baare mein bhi rakhna chahta hoon. Lekin, main sochta hoon ki, hamari part ko aapke saath jab ki aapke saath hi aapko bhaag sir dhakaate hai, unhe bhi mat ke. Aur abhi aapke mamuli baam bhi aae, pinning ki jab bhi ki badle pehle hi aapke mamuli par mere liye. Lekin baad mein aapke liye badi of kaun hai, yeh baath hi par, it is hamari it is hamari aapke saath hi itni tareef kar raha hai yaad kar dijiye ki aap hamare mamuli hum hain. Aur mujhe itna bhayarya hai ki aapko bhi samajh kar bada bada hai aur hamne jalgaon bar baad bhi laga de, tab bhi aap ke liye kya kehna hai, bahut hi bada bada hai. Aur hamne bhi badle ke sath bhaag gambal, hamare liye achaa nahi bhi bada bada. Lekin, main aasha karta hoon ki ham bhi shuruvaat yeh bhi kiya hai, aur usse bhi bahut hi achaa kar sakta hoon."
9,Yeah. It's kind of emotionally and it feels good.,symp/reasoning,72_9,P,ack,,Haan. Yeh thoda sa emotional hai aur acha lagta hai.
10,It's nice not butting heads with her cuz,routine,72_10,P,id,,Yeh accha hai ki hum uske saath sar karne par na takrayen
11,"I'm sure like, ",routine,72_11,T,gc,,"Me sure like,"
12,"you want like, I want a good relationship with my mom. I don't I don't choose purposefully to not have a good relationship with her. Yeah, it feels really good. I feel like I can have better relationships, other places as well now because that's healthy.",story,72_12,P,gc,,"Theek hai, you want that, I also want a good relationship with my mom. Mujhe purposefully, have karne ka intention nahi hai ki I don't have a good relationship with her. Haan, ye mujhe bada acchha lagta hai. I feel like mera aur bhi theek se ho sakta hai kahin aur places par kyunki woh sehatmand hota hai."
13,"Right. Right money. And also to I think along with that, is that kind of the strategies, I think that you've, you know, my hunch would be is that some of the strategies that you've used, engage your mom in a more meaningful way have really kind of come in handy in some respects in terms of like, some of the other relationships that you've had, you know, especially, I know that you and Kathy have gotten closer, and even the fact that you've allowed yourself to kind of, you know, connect with somebody else, like, you know, with Alan, you know, I know you were talking with me the other day about some other friends that you've, you know, met and people that you've really got a little bit closer to so that's been really exciting. Yeah,",routine,72_13,T,gc,,"Haan. Haan paise. Aur saath mein mere hunch ke mutabik, main maanta hoon ki kuch strategies, jinhe aapne use kiya hai, apni maa ko ek zyada munasib tareeke se shaamil karne mein, aapke dusre rishtey bhi kaafi kaam aaye hain, aapki aur Kathy ki dosti aur khaas karke yeh ki aapne khud ko doosre kisi ke saath jodne ki ijazat di hai, jaise ki Alan ke saath, main jaanta hoon aapne mujhse baat ki thi kal hi kisi aur dost ke baare mein, jise aapne jaana aur jinse aapne khoob mulaqaat ki hai, yeh sach mein bahut exciting raha hai. Haan."
14,yeah. Yeah. Just get to not go home and feel terrible. Right.,routine,72_14,P,ack,,Haan. Haan. Bas jao ghar nahi jaane aur bura mehsoos karne ke liye. Theek hai.
15,"Yeah. Yeah. So then, then, kind of from, from your perspective, again, you know, we'll talk more about this in, you know, as you mean, I realize I'm kind of putting you on the spot, but as you've kind of thought about or thinking about it. Maybe you can think about it. To even from now on to the next couple of sessions, but just starting to think about like, what is it that you've really done that you really feel like has been really, that's really helped you make changes in the way in which you've, you know, managed your food or your binge eating.",routine,72_15,T,ack,,"Oh haan. Oh haan. Toh fir, fir, se, se, kind of from, from tumhari perspective se, again, pata hai, we'll talk more about this in, jaisa tumhe samjha rahe ho, main realize kar raha hoon ki main tumhe thoda pressure de raha hoon, par jaise hi tumne is bare mein socha ya soch rahe ho. Shayad tum iske bare mein soch sakte ho. Abhi se hi agle kuch sessions tak, par bas shuru karo sochne ke bare mein, ki tumne kya kiya hai jo tumhe sach mein kaafi madat ki hai, jisse tumne apni khana peena ya apne binge eating ko manage kiya hai."
16,"I mean, just really trying to be more positive in my relationships and being more open and communicating, not keeping things in Sofia, like, when I kept things in it kind of bubble up. And that's what made me want to do something that made me feel better. And I yeah, I mean, like, something bothers me, like, immediately express it,",story,72_16,P,gc,,"Main keh rha tha, main bas apne rishto mei thoda sa positive banna chaahta hu aur zyada khula ho kar baat karna chaahta hu, Sofia, maine jab bhi kuch cheezein andar hi rakh li tab wo badh jaati thi. Aur tab mujhe kuch aisa karna ka mann karta tha jo mujhe accha mehsus karata tha. Aur haan, agar koi cheez mujhe pareshan karti hai, toh main turant use bayan kar deta hu."
17,"bro. No, I've noticed that as well. And it seems like that that's been one of the important things that you've done. It's really helped, you know, with the changes that you've made. What else feels like that? I mean, you know, I mean, obviously, that's been really important, but what are the other things that you've noticed in terms of like, you know, how it's been going",routine,72_17,T,gc,,"Bhai, maine bhi dekha hai ki jo tune kiya hai woh kaafi maayne rakhta hai. Issne toh asaani se kafi madad ki hai, pata hai na? Aur kya aur cheezein aisi hain jo aisi hi lagti hain? Pata hai, yeh bahut mahatvapurna tha, par aur kya cheezein hain jo aapne dekhi hain, jaise ki, aapko kuch badlaav nazar aa rahe hain."
18,"I feel better about myself. And, like not having comments from my mom anymore and having a guy in my life who really likes how I love. Yeah. And yeah, just yet feeling happier with myself.",routine,72_18,P,id,,"Mujhe apne aap se achha mehsoos hota hai. Aur, ab meri maa se koi comments na hona aur ek aadmi mere zindagi mein hai jo mujhse bahut pyaar karta hai. Haan. Aur haan, bas ab khud se khush hona zyada aasaan hai."
19,"grades are good. No, you know, things like, like we're really in a good space. And I think the other thing too, I was aware of that we, you know, that you'd mentioned to me in particular last time was that and I didn't get a chance to talk with you as much about it. So I think we had so much to talk about last session, but I was really struck by the fact that you It seems like you haven't been as body conscious as you have been in the past. And I didn't know if you've if you've noticed that.",routine,72_19,T,gc,,"Acchaan achee hain. Nahi, tum jaante ho, cheeze aisi hai, ham bilkul achee sthiti mein hain. Aur mujhe yeh bhi pata tha ki hum, tumne mujhe pehle bhi bataya tha ki is baare mein aur maine tumse uske baare mein itna nahi baat kar paya. Toh humare paas pehle itna bahut kuch baat karne ke liye tha, lekin mujhe yeh bahut dhyan gaya ki tum pichle samay se zyada sharir ko lekar chintit nahi lagte. Aur main nahi jaanta ki kya tumhe bhi yeh pata hai ya nahi."
20,"Yeah, no, I feel like I've known like a little bit. Notice that Yeah. Especially that you bring it up. It's true,",routine,72_20,P,ack,,"Haan, nahi, mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe thoda sa pata hai. Dekh, haan. Khaas kar ke jab tum isko uthaate ho. Sach hai."
21,"right? Yeah. Cuz I know like initially and even like, there have been times even along the way. When you'll make, like, you know, I didn't feel like it looked very good, or I felt like something felt really tight on me or, you know, I just felt like that other people were looking at me or maybe judging me, but it seems like that, that as we've kind of moved along that there's really been I've really noticed a real kind of a little bit of a shift in the way in which you've kind of been regarding yourself. And it seems like it's been a little bit different",routine,72_21,T,gc,,"Right? Haan. Kyunki pata hai initially aur bahut baar aise hi hua hai. Jab aap banate ho, jaise, pata nahi mujhe nahi lagta ki woh bahut accha dikh raha hai, ya mujhe lagta hai ki kuch bahut zyada tang raha hai ya, pata nahi, mujhe lagta hai ki log mujhe dekh rahe hain ya shayad mujhe judge kar rahe hain, par lagta hai ki, jabse humne age badhna shuru kiya hai, mujhe pata hai ki aapne khud ko thoda alag tareeke se dekhne lagi hai. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki ismein ek chota sa change aane ki shuruwat hui hai, jaise aap khud ko dekhne ka tarika. Aur lagta hai ki ismein kuch alag hi ho gaya hai."
22,"in that hearing, like, any comments, all my mom about any of that stuff, right. I feel like I've gotten to the point where I'm not concerned like that. I'm going to hear a comment. Right.",routine,72_22,P,gc,,"Isme suniye, koi baat nahin, meri maa se kuch bhi ho, par mujhe aisa lagta hai ki ab main us stage tak pahunch gayi hoon jahan main uske baare mein chinta nahin karti. Main toh bas ek comment sunne jaa rahi hoon. Sahi hai na?"
23,"Okay, but so I'm going to go ahead and make you talk about it anyway. But what did you do in order to be able to get those comments, though, to stop? Because obviously, I think you did something really significant with her. Yes.",routine,72_23,T,irq,,"Thik hai, par main aage badh ke tumhe uske baare mein baat karane ko majaboor karungi. Lekin tume kya kiya shayad un comments ko rokne ke liye? Kyunki nishchit roop se, mujhe lagta hai tumne uske saath kuch khaas kiya hai. Haan."
24,"I mean, I thought about what you said about really acknowledging that that put a lot of pain on me and Justin Lee, and I know I was able to let her know that and is hired scared to tell her that I mean, she recognized that. Yeah. And yeah, she kind of explained how she thought that she was helping me or she wanted me to have a lot of friends in high school. And that's what she, I mean, she kind of said, like her mom said the same thing to her.",routine,72_24,P,od,,"Mai toh socha tha ki jab tumne kaha ki yeh mere aur Justin Lee pe bhaari dard dala, tab maine tumhe is baat ko samajhane ki koshish ki aur use pata bhi tha ki main tumhe woh baat bata chuki hu aur woh darr gayi thi ki main usse yeh baat batana chahti. Usne yeh baat samjha. Haan, woh bataya ki woh mujhe kaise help kar rahi thi aur woh chahti thi ki main high school mein bahut saare dost banau. Aur yahi baat uski maa ne bhi usse kahi thi, waise hi jaise meri maa ne mujhse kahi thi."
25,"Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and that's really not uncommon when you have, you know, it's funny that just even like, not, you know, like, big, big research had, but it seems like that that's pretty consistent, that, you know, kind of, like, you know, mothers to daughters who become mothers to daughters, like sometimes it's kind of what we call this intergenerational transmission of like, you know, kind of criticality about, you know, shape and weight and, and, you know, some, you know, really proud of you that you, you know, kind of had the courage to address it with her directly and just let her know how you feel because, you know, I think, you know, as a parent, I know that you owe it Like, you know, I always want to try to do the right thing, you know, and I always, you know, I don't purposely want to inflict pain on my children, even though my daughters would suggest that I probably do. But in general, I don't. That's not my goal is to be, you know, harsh and critical. In fact, I really was, you know, try to really be helpful. And I think most parents try to do the right thing. But I, and I think maybe your mom just didn't realize the degree to which that really bothered you and how much that hurt. And in many respects, how much that kind of really drove you to, you know, really, you know, take it out on yourself, so to speak. And so for you to have the courage to bring that up, I think was really helpful. Yeah, yeah. So I really think that that made a lot of differences, as well as, you know, kind of reaching out to others and again, in just the open expression of your feelings, so yeah. So yeah, I think the things that we're doing like now, I think I'd really like to see us kind of continue to, you know, obviously, you still are doing a lot of really good work in terms of like the things that you're talking about and, but yet, I'm also aware that you know, as we're over the next couple sessions, we kind of keep doing a few of these things kind of wrapping up. And then our last session we can more or less, kind of formally, you know, say goodbye and talk about kind of like what the next steps are and, you know, some things you might want to be paying attention to or things you might want to, you know, be mindful of, but we'll get there so yeah. ",story,72_25,T,gc,,"Han, han. Accha, tu jaante ho, aur yah bahut aam hai jab tumhare paas hota hai, jaante ho, yah mazedaar bat hai ki kabhi kabhi lagta hai ki bahut badi, badi talaash karte the, lekin yeh seems kar raha tha ki yah bahut consistent hai ki maa beti se maa beti ban gayi aur, kabhi kabhi yah hamari bolte hain ki yah hamare intergenerational transmission se related hai jaisa ki tum takleef ke baare mein kafi critical ho, yah shape aur weight ke baare mein. Aur tumne, tumhe yah batane ke liye bahut khush hu ki tum, sidhe uske saath is baare mein baat karne ka saahas dikhaae kyunki, tumhe chahiye tha yah pata hona ki, tum, ek ma aur main jaanta hu ki tum uska hissa ho. Jaise ki, main hamesha achhe kam karna chahta hu, tumhe chot pahuchaane ke aalawa, mujhe yah nahi chaahiye. Lekin yah mere lakshay nahi hai, achhe aur harsh aur critical hokar. Haan, main sach mein, kam karna chahti thi. Aur maine unki madad karne ki koshish ki aur mujhe lagta hai ki sabse achhe ma baap koshish karte hai. Lekin, mujhe lagta hai ki tumhari maa ne realise nahi kiya tha ki tumhe kitna pareshaan karti hai aur tumhe kitna hurt krti hai. Aur kai baar yah haalat hai ki tum apne aap par bahut zyada gussa utaar dete ho, jaisa ki kaha jata hai, tumne apne aap par aur apne iraade par bahut ho liya. Aur tumne yah saahas dikha dete hue ki tumne yah baat uthaya hai, mujhe lagta hai ki yah bahut madad kiya hai. Han, han. To main yah sochta hu ki yah bahut important changes mein, jaise ki tumne bhi kaha hai ki yah chiz kaam kar rahe ho aur, lekin main bhi jaanta hu ki tumhe kafi plays aur kabhi kabhi, humare agli kuch sessions mein, kuch fundamentals pe focus karte hue, aur phir hamare last session mein, officially alwida keh sakte hai aur iss baare mein baat kar sakte hai ki agle kadam kya hai aur tumhe kya dhyaan rakhna chahiye ya dhyan mein rakhna chahiye. Lekin woh hum wahan pahunch jayenge, so han."

27,summary,"The therapist recounts how the patient has successfuly overcome binge eating, and discusses the patient's willingness to engage with mom despite their ill-treatment. The patient has been trying to keep their relationships positive by being open and more communicative with Sophia. The patient feel better about themselves to have someone to love them and their grades have been good. The patient's mom has been critical about the patient regarding shape, weight and other things as an intergenerational transmission. The patient has progressed greatly by communicating this with their mom and seeking help from others. The therapist asks to continue discussing these things more in the next couple sessions and probably wrap up.",,,,,
