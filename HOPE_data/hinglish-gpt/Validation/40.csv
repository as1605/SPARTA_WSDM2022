0,"Hello, Maria, it's nice to see you.",inactive,40_0,T,gt,,"Namaste, Maria, it's acchi to dekhna tujhe."
1,Hello. I wish I could say it's nice to see you but it's never good to go to the doctor.,inactive,40_1,P,gc,,"Namaste. Main chahta huin ki main aapko dekh kar khush hun, lekin doctor ke paas jaana kabhi bhi achcha nahi hota."
2,"Fortunately for me, I hear that a lot. So we're going to be talking about ways to manage your blood clots and options for treatment. But first I'd like to check in on a few things. The first is you're smoking. You were to half pack at during your last visit and we talked about how important it is for To quit, I'd say it's even more important now that smoking is associated with DVT. So, have you quit?",symp/reasoning,40_2,T,yq,,"Mujhe khush kismat hokar jo yeh sunai de raha hai. Isliye hum apki khoon ke galtiliyon ko sambhalne aur ilaj karne ke tarike ke bare mein baat karne wale hain. Lekin pehle main kuch cheezein janchna chahunga. Pehli baat hai aapki smoking ki. Aapke pichle dauraan aadhe pack shayad kiye the aur humne baat ki thi ki isse band karna kitna jaruri hai. To, kya aapne smoking chhod di? Kyunki ab smoking aur DVT ka rishta pakka hai, isliye ab bahut hi zyada zaroori hai smoking chhodna."
3,"No, I haven't quit.",symp/reasoning,40_3,P,on,,"Nahin, maine nahi chhoda hai."
4,So deep. Do you remember our conversation from our last visit? That's when I give you the information about quitting smoking and the contact number for tobacco treatment specialist.,routine,40_4,T,irq,,Kitna gehra. Kya aap hamare pichhle milne ki baat yaad rakhte hain? Tab maine aapko dhumrapan chhodne ki jankari aur tambaku ka ilaaj karne ke liye sampark karene wale specialist ka number diya tha.
5,"Yes, I remember. But no, I didn't quit. And no, I didn't call her. ",routine,40_5,P,id,,"Haan, main yaad kar raha hu. Par nahi, maine chhod nahi diya. Aur nahi, maine usse call nahi kiya."
6,And why is that?,routine,40_6,T,crq,,Aur kyon aisa hai?
7,"I'm not ready. And I'm too upset to talk about this. I don't mean to be rude doctor. But I've had a hard time lately. And I'm not in the mood for you to get mad at me for not quitting. I'll let you know when I'm ready. We can talk about it. But here now today, I'm here to talk about my blood clots.",story,40_7,P,cd,,"मैं तैयार नहीं हूँ। और मुझे इस बारे में बात करने के लिए बहुत उदास व्यथा हो रही है। मैं डॉक्टर को अस्वच्छ न होना है, यह मतलब नहीं कि मैं असभ्य हूँ। लेकिन आज मेरे पास कठिन समय था। और मुझे आपसे क्रोधित होने की इच्छा नहीं है कि मैं धुम्रपान नहीं छोड़ने पर मुझ पर गुस्सा हो जाऊं। मैं आपको बता द"
8,"Well, we're on the same page then because that's exactly why I'm talking to you about quitting smoking, because smoking is a major risk factor for DVT. Even if you even if we treat you now if you don't quit smoking, I'm afraid the blood clots will return again.",routine,40_8,T,irq,,"Achha, hum toh ab ek hi panno pe hai kyunki main aap se aur kyun bata raha hoon DVT se bachne ke liye dhoomrapan chodne ki baare mein, kyunki dhoomrapan DVT ke liye bada khatra hai. Agar abhi aap ko ilaaj kar lein lekin dhoomrapan chhodna na karein, main dar hai ki khoon ke thos thos phir se wapas aa jaenge."
9,Let's just talk about my treatment right now. Okay?,routine,40_9,P,com,,चलो अभी मेरे इलाज के बारे में बात करें।
10,I haven't really thought about it actually. I thought about canceling this appointment because I knew you're going to bring it up again.,routine,40_10,P,id,,"Actually, mujhe yeh sooch ke bhaav bhi nahi diya tha. Main iss afspraak ko raddh karne ke baare mein soocha kyunki mujhe pata tha tu phir se iske baare mein charcha karega."
11,Talking about smoking with me as hard for you.,routine,40_11,T,irq,,मुझसे धूम्रपान के बारे में बात करना तुम्ह
12,"Yes, it's because you're going to tell me to quit like you always do a limit filter just like everyone else. Like my caseworker. The building manager everybody seems to They know what I need to do. And nobody thinks I know anything.",routine,40_12,P,id,,"Haan, yeh tab hota hai kyunki tum mujhe hamesha ki tarah chhodne ke liye bolne wale ho ek seema filter bas sabhi ki tarah. Mere case worker ki tarah. Building manager saare log jante hain ki mujhe kya karna hai. Aur koi nahi sochta ki main kuch bhi jaanta hoon."
13,"So when it comes to smoking, you feel that other people want to tell you what to do and make your decisions for you. You don't feel heard or respected?",routine,40_13,T,crq,,"Smoking ke mamle mein, tumhe lagta hai ki dusre log tumhe kya karna hai wo bata kar, tumhari adhikar chheen lete hain aur tumhare faislay tumhare liye kar dete hain. Kya tumhe lagta hai ki tumhari baat suni aur samman kiya jaata hai?"
14,No respect. That's it. Yes.,routine,40_14,P,cd,,Koi izzat nahi. Bus. Haan.
15,"Well, I just want to say that I am very glad you decided to come in today. So we can take care of this blood clot because blood clots are very serious and I know you're concerned. As your provider, I have to be honest, and say that smoking can cause blood clots. But hopefully some of the information I give you today will help you in your decision to quit smoking. Now, having said that, I know my opinion, is not the deciding factor. Quitting smoking as a decision only you can make.",story,40_15,T,irq,,"""Well, I just want to say that I am very glad that you decided to come in today. We can address this blood clot because these blood clots are not good relations, and I know you're worried. As your doctor, I must be honest, and tell you that smoking can cause blood clots. But hopefully some of the baaten-mijaaz I give you today will help you in deciding to chhod do smoking. Having said that, I know that my opinion is not the deciding factor. To quit smoking is a choice that only you can make."""
16,"Well, I'm really glad I came into I have to get this blood clot condition under control. I know that",routine,40_16,P,id,,"Achha, mujhe bahut khushi hui ki maine iss blood clot condition ko control karne ke liye apne paas aana chahiye. Mujhe pata hai ki"
17,"would it be okay with you, if I share some information about smoking and blood clots. And I can tell you what I know and then we'll see what you think. ",routine,40_17,T,orq,,"Kya aapke liye theek hogi, agar main smoking aur khoon ke taale ke baare mein kuch jaankari share karoon? Aur main aapko bata sakti hoon ki main kya jaanti hoon aur phir hum dekhenge ki aap kya sochte hain."
18,"Yes. I don't know that I will quit, but I will listen.",routine,40_18,P,od,,"Hanji. Mujhe nahin pata ki main chhodunga ya nahin, par main sununga zaroor."
19,"So, what do you think?",routine,40_19,T,irq,,"Toh, tum kya sochte ho?"
20,"I always thought that the blood clots came from my mother. Hello, like passed down like genetics. I didn't know that smoking could cause this. I just thought that blood clots ran in my family. I guess I also didn't get how dangerous this clotting can be. ",story,40_20,P,id,,"Main humesha sochate the ki mere maa se hi khoon ki dabbiyaan aati hain. Hi, isasee utarati hui prajaati ki tarah. Mujhe nahin pata tha ki yeh smoking se bhee ho sakati hai. Main to bas yeh sochata tha ki khoon ki dabbiyaan mere parivaar mein chal rahee hain. Shayad main yeh bhi na samajh paaya ki yeh jamavat kitana khatarnak ho sakata hai."
21,You seem surprised and a little more aware now of the smoking risks?,routine,40_21,T,yq,,Kya tumhe smooking ke khatre ke bare me ab thoda aur pata chal gya hai aur tum lagta hai hairaan ho gye ho?
22,I guess so. Yes.,routine,40_22,P,op,,शायद मैं सही कह र
23,"So Maria, I'd like to get a better sense of what you think about smoking. So on a scale of one to 10 with one being, you don't think it is at all important that you quit and 10 being you're ready to quit today? Where would you put yourself?",story,40_23,T,irq,,"Toh Maria, main chahta hoon ki mujhe tumhare viewpoints ke baare mein zyaada idea mile smoking ke baare mein. Toh ek scale ki madad se ek se das tak, ek being tumhe lagta hai ki yeh bilkul zaroori nahi hai ki tum quit karo, aur dus being tum ready ho quit karne ke liye aaj? Tum kahan khud ko daaloge?"
24,"Well, if you had asked me when I first came in, I would have said less than one. But now I would have to say four ",story,40_24,P,id,,"Achha, agar aap pehle mujhse poochhte ki main yahan pehle kab aaya, toh maine kam se kam ek kam bataya hota. Lekin ab mein kahna padega ki char."
25,Why Four and not a lower number.,routine,40_25,T,irq,,Kyun char aur ek chota sankhya nahi.
26,That's a good question. Let me think about it.,routine,40_26,P,id,,Woh ek achhi baat hai. Mujhe is baare mein sochna hai.
27,I guess it's a four because of the blood clots. The blood clots are really heavy on my mind right now.,symp/reasoning,40_27,P,id,,Mujhe lagta hai yeh chaar ho sakta hai kyunki khoon ki gaddiyan hain. Khoon ki gaddiyan mere dimaag par bohot bojhdaar hain abhi.
28,"So having a better understanding of how smoking adds to the risk of blood clots, increases your desire to quit.",symp/reasoning,40_28,T,yq,,"इसलिए स्मोकिंग का अधिकतर समझने से यह दिखाने की क्षमता, फ्लैक्स। क्योंकि स्वयं में तोड़ने क"
29,A little. Yes.,inactive,40_29,P,ack,,थोड़ा हाँ। ह
30,"What else if anything, makes quitting important to you?",routine,40_30,T,orq,,"Kya aur koi, aapke liye chhodna kitna mahatvapurn hai?"
31,"Know, the bigger thing for me, is the fear of being evicted from my apartment. There's a rule that we can smoke in the house. And I stick to it for the most part, but the other day, I smoked out the window. And that was only the second time I've done it. But don't you know, the building manager caught me. So now I am sure she's going to be watching me even more. I can't lose my part. With",story,40_31,P,od,,"Pata hai, meri liye, mera bada darr yeh hai ki mere flat se eviction ho jayega. Wahaan par chakhna allowed hai. Main mostly uski toh rule follow karti hoon, lekin kal, maine window se chakh liya. Aur woh meri doosri baar thi. Lekin tu jaanta hai, building manager ne mujhe pakad liya. Ab main 100% sure hoon ki woh mujhe aur zyada closely dekhegi. Main apna part nahi kho sakhti."
32,"the possibility of losing your apartment because of smoking really upsets you, in addition to your health,",routine,40_32,T,irq,,"""Tere swasthya ke sath-sath, tambaku karne ki wajah se apne flats ko kho dene ki sambhaavna tumhe sachmuch chinta deti hai."""
33,"I would hate to think that my sogdian they lost their home because their mom chose smoking over abiding by stupid code, even if I hate that rule. I smoked when I was pregnant with them. And thank you, Holy Mother, they were born healthy. I don't think I could live with myself if they lost their home because of something I'm doing.",story,40_33,P,id,,"My jee bhais, mere sogdian ka ghar jaanu guzarti rohbaano se jo unki mummy ne smoking ki pehle kar lia code ke bhaiyo se churaliya, waise hi ki mai oos rule se nafrat bhi karni. Mai unke mother banai pahale unki pregnancy ke waqt daru pite the. Aur shukr hai, pavitra maa, unka janam swasth hua. Mai apne aap se na sahi rakh payegi agar mere soutan se humari baithi ka ghar gum ho jaye kuch karne ke wajah se."
34,So it sounds like your priority in life is taking care of providing for your children. It's obvious that you're a good mom. And if you had to leave your home because you were smoking that would be tough to bear.,routine,40_34,T,yq,,"Toh aisa lagta hai ki teri zindagi ka sabse bada kaam hai apne bachcho ka khayal rakhna. Yeh bilkul saaf hai ki tu ek acchi maa hai. Aur agar tu apne ghar chhodna padhna padega kyuki tu cigaratte pi rahi thi, toh woh sehna mushkil ho jayega."
35,"Yes, they would.",inactive,40_35,P,ack,,"Haan, woh karenge."
36,So let me ask you a slightly different question on that same scale of one to 10. How would you rate your confidence to quit?,routine,40_36,T,orq,,Toh mai aapse ek alag sawaal puchna chahta hu usi scale par ek se dus tak. Aap apne bharose ko chhodne ki darjay se kis tarah se khenge?
37,confidence? I'd have to say at two.,routine,40_37,P,od,,भरोसा? मैं कहना होगा कि दो पर।
38,So you are not feeling very confident right now,inactive,40_38,T,crq,,Toh tum abhi bohot confident nahi lag rahe ho
39,"who Oh, no, not confident at all. I mean, I've tried to quit so many times, and I just can't do it.",inactive,40_39,P,cd,,"Kaunse, oh, bilkul bhi confident nahi hai. Mainai bohot baar try kiya hai quit karne ki koshish kari hai, par main kar nahi paaya."
40,"So you've been persistent and trying and haven't been successful yet. Still, you you set a two and not a one. I'm curious about that.",routine,40_40,T,irq,,"Toh tum persistent rahe ho aur koshish kar rahe ho lekin abhi tak safal nahi hue ho. Fir bhi, tumne two set kiye hai aur ek nahi. Mujhe uspe kuch aur janne ki ichha ho rahi hai."
41,"Well, the only reason I said are two is that I tried quitting smoking when I was pregnant with Santhi and they are both. I went for two months without a cigarette with Dale. And I didn't make it past that. And that was really mad at myself for that. I really wanted to quit from my babies and I failed. I guess. I'm just hopeless. I mean, who keeps smoking when there's a baby inside? ",story,40_41,P,id,,"हाँ, मैंने कहा था की दो ही कारण हैं इसलिए कि मैंने संति के गर्भावस्था के दौरान धूम्रपान छोड़ने का प्रयास किया था और वे दोनों मेरे साथ थे। मैं डेल के साथ सिगरेट बिना दो महीने तक गई थी। लेकिन मैं उससे आगे नहीं बढ़ा। और मैं खुद को उसके लिए बेहद नाराजगी करता था। मुझे अपने बच्चों के लिए धूम्रपान छोड़ना था और मैंने विफलता को पाया। शायद, मैं बेहिस"
42,Sounds like you really feel like you let yourself and your children down. And that's hard to accept given how much you love your kids.,routine,40_42,T,crq,,"Lagta hai ki tum sach mein apne aap aur apne bachon ke saath kuch galat kiya hai. Aur yeh bohat mushkil hai qubool karna, kyunki tum apne bachon se kitna pyaar karte ho."
43,"Yes. And I'm doing it again right now by not following the rules. I'm addicted to cigarettes, just like a drug addict. In the end the cigarettes always with.",story,40_43,P,cd,,"Haan. Aur main abhi phir se kar rahi hoon, rules ko na maan kar. Cigarette ka nashaa mujhe hai, bas ek drug addict ki tarah. Ant mein, cigarette hamesha jeet jaati hai."
44,So what what do you think Santa and to think about your smoking?,routine,40_44,T,orq,,Toh tumhe lagta hai ki Santa ko tumhara smoking ke baare mein kya sochna chahiye?
45,"Santhi yells at me. And sometimes they'll cry when I go out to smoke. He says, Mama smoking is bad.",routine,40_45,P,od,,"Santhi mujhse daant lagati hai. Aur kabhi-kabhi jab main cigarette peene jaata hu, wo ro dete hai. Uska kehna hai, Mama smoking kharab hai."
46,"So you know it would be best for you and your children if you quit. If you had the right support and tools to manage this addiction. If you believed you could do it, you would",routine,40_46,T,irq,,"Tumhe jante ho ki tumhare liye aur tumhare bachchon ke liye sabse accha hoga agar tum chod do. Agar tumhe sahi sahyog aur upkaran mile toh is lat ki niyantran karne ke liye. Agar tum ye maante ho ki tum kar sakte ho, toh tum kar paoge."
47,I would like to do so but I just don't think I can do it.,routine,40_47,P,id,,"I am interested in doing it, but I am not sure if I am capable of doing it."
48,You quit for two months when you were pregnant with tail.,symp/reasoning,40_48,T,irq,,Tum do mahine ke liye chhod deti jab tum'pe garbh tha kuchh problem ki vajah se.
49,How did you do with them?,routine,40_49,T,irq,,Tum unke saath kaise rahe?
50,I don't know. I just did it. I fought the urges with sucking on straws and some hard Kelly's I just did it.,symp/reasoning,40_50,P,id,,Main nahi jaanta. Main bas kar diya. Mein ne Úhshao se ladhna chhoda aur kuch hard Kelly's chuse kar main bas kar diya.
51,So you were able to quit on your own for two months. That's impressive. Have you ever used any other form of help like nicotine replacement or support groups?,symp/reasoning,40_51,T,irq,,"Kya tum apne aap do mahine se chhod paaye? Wah kamaal hai! Kya tumne kabhi kisi aur tarah ki madad li hai, jaise nicotine replacement ya support groups ki?"
52,"No, I think people can quit. If they really want to. I'm just too weak.",symp/reasoning,40_52,P,id,,"No yaar, I think log chhod sakte hain. Agar unhe sach mein chahiye toh. Main toh bas bahut kamzor hun."
53,"Ah, wow. You must be pretty hard on yourself. What would you say if I told you that very few people only 4% of us are able to quit successfully cold turkey.",routine,40_53,T,irq,,"Aye, wah. You must be tedha khud pe. Kya bolte, agar main tumhe bataunga ki kafi kam log sirf 4% humse afsos ke bina thanda turkey chhut sakte hain."
54,"No, there really? Is that true, huh?",inactive,40_54,P,crq,,"Nahin yaar, sach mein? Woh such hai kya, hain?"
55,Yes. And and most people try many times before they're successful. their medications and groups at and I'd be happy to share that information with you. I'd like to help you if that's something that you'd like.,routine,40_55,T,cd,,Haan. Aur aam taur par log kai baar koshish karte hain jab tak ki unki safalta nahin hoti hai. Unki dawai aur dalon ko dekh kar main khushi hogi ki main aapke saath ye jaankaari baant sakoon. Agar aap chahte ho to main aapki madad karna chaahoonga.
56,"Well, I don't know. I'm Let me think about it. Can you give me the information again? The booklet the brochure you gave me before. I didn't want to tell you but I threw them away when I got home. But I really want to read them this time.",routine,40_56,P,id,,"Well, main nahi jaanta. Main sochne do. Kya aap mujhe fir se wahi jaankari de sakte hain? Wo booklet ya brochure jo aapne pehle mujhe diya tha. Main aapko bataana chahta nahi tha lekin jab main ghar aaya tab maine unhe phaink diya. Lekin main iss baar unhe padhna chahta hoon."
57,That's great. Maria.,inactive,40_57,T,gt,,Yeh to bahut achcha hai. Maria.
58,"You can look them over and I'll have our tobacco treatment specialist, Sonia, follow up with you. We have an excellent tobacco treatment program here and I am I believe that Sonia can help you quit when you're ready. Right? What? When would be a good time to check back in?",routine,40_58,T,id,,"Tum unhe dekh sakte ho aur mai hamare tobacco treatment visheshagya, Sonia, tumhare sath phir se sampark karungi. Hamare yaha ek utkrist tobacco treatment karyakram hai aur mai vishvas karte hu ki Sonia tumhe tyag karne mai madad kar sakti hai jab tum tayar ho. Sahi hai na? Kya? Kab hum firse check kar sakte hai?"
59,"She can call me next week and number two, I may be ready to try again.",routine,40_59,P,id,,"हो सकता है कि वह मुझे अगले हफ्ते कोल कर सकती है और दूसरे नंबर पर, मैं वापसी"
60,Absolutely. And I'll have Sonia call you. I just want you to know that I understand how hard it is for you to talk about quitting smoking. And I really appreciate it.,inactive,40_60,T,gt,,Haanji. Aur main Sonia ko tumhe call karne doongi. Mujhe bas yeh pata lagaana hai ki tumhe dhumrapaan chhodne ke baare mein baat karna kitna mushkil hai. Aur main tumhari mehnat ko sach mein prashansaa karta hoon.
61,"So, would you like to talk about how to manage blood clots? Yes,",inactive,40_61,T,orq,,"Toh, kya tumko blood clots ko manage karne ke baare mein baat karni hai? Haan."
62,that sounds good. All right.,inactive,40_62,P,od,,Woh achcha lagta hai. Theek hai.
63,summary,"The patient needs to manage blood clots and explore options for treatment. The therapist asks the patient if they have quit smoking since it is associated with DVT. The patient feels it has been passed down by genetics from their mom, and they feel motivated by a score of 4 on 10 to quit today.
