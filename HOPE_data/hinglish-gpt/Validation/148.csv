1,"Umm I'm doing okay, I guess. Umm I guess something happened over this past week. I have been looking for a new job since I left my last one. And I found I found this really good job on the internet. But the problem is that the job is working with kids and they they have to do a drug test in order for me to get the job. And it kinda like it made me think it made me think a little bit more about something that I've been considering for a while which is kind of just given up, given up we'd forget like it I'm thinking about it for a while. But okay, I also kind of think about the way the way we'd really helps me and like, if I'm ever feeling like really, really anxious about something I mean, we kind of have to chill out and hope to relax and I just don't know if I'm ready to give that up yet.",symp/reasoning,148_1,P,gt,-1.0,"Umm main theek hoon, I guess. Umm mainne kal se kuch hua hoga. Main apni last job chhodne ke baad se naya job dhoondh raha tha. Aur maine internet pe ek bahut achha job dhoondha hai. Lekin problem yeh hai ki job baccho ke saath kaam karna hai aur unko drug test karna hoga mujhe job milne ke liye. Aur yeh mujhe sochne par majboor kar diya, main kuch waqt se soch raha tha ki bas sab chhod hi de yaaro, isko bhool jaate hain. Par theek hai, maine ye bhi socha ki we yeh baat mujhe kaise help karta hai yaaro, jab bhi main kuch bahut pareshaan hota hoon us waqt, we hi mere saath baith ke mujhe shaant karane mein madad karta hai aur main nahi jaanta ki kya main abhi isse chhodne ke liye taiyaar hoon."
2,So the marijuana has real value for you that you don't want to see going.,symp/reasoning,148_2,T,yq,0.0,Toh kya marijauna tumhare liye sucha nahi hai ki tum use jane nahi chahte ho?
3,"Yeah, it does. It's a it's a good way to self medicate in a way",inactive,148_3,P,op,0.0,"Haan, yeh toh hota hai. Yeh ek achha tarika hai khud ke liye dawai lena ke liye ek tarika hai"
4,"and at the same time, you would like this job. ",inactive,148_4,T,crq,0.0,"Aur iss samay, tumhe ye naukri pasand hogi."

6,"So I could see how this would be you know, a pincher.",inactive,148_6,T,crq,0.0,Tu main dekh sakta hun ki ye tumhare liye ek pincher hoga.
7,"right. Yeah, it's I mean, it's kind of like it's put me in a difficult spot like I definitely I definitely want to get that job but you know, if I cut it if I cut out smoking like, I don't know what else I would do, like if I if I started to have a panic attack or if if I was really like anxious about Like anything that I'm worrying about, like i don't i don't know what i did copes.",symp/reasoning,148_7,P,cd,-1.0,"Right. Haan, mujhe matlab, mujhe wo mushkil par le aaya hai jaise hi ki wo naukri pakka chahiye par tum jaante ho, agar main smoking chor du toh kuch aur kya karungi, jaise agar mujhe panic attack hua ya fir agar mujhe koi chinta hai uski wajah se, jaise main actually wo job paas hi nahi kar paaungi, toh main kya karungi, mujhe koi jugaad nahi pata."
8,Have you been treated for anxiety before?,symp/reasoning,148_8,T,yq,0.0,Kya aapne pehle se hi chinta ki samasya ka ilaj karvaya hai?
9,"Um, I did therapy for a little bit, but it was like, I don't know, back then it was kind of like when the anxiety was just starting, so it wasn't too big of a problem. So I like I quit there because it wasn't really doing that much. Yeah.",story,148_9,P,op,-1.0,"यूम, मैं थोड़ी देर के लिए थेरेपी किया, लेकिन यह था जैसे, मुझे नहीं पता था, पीछे से यह कनै है जब मैं चिंता करने थे बस शुरू था, इसलिए यह काफी बड़ी समस्या नहीं थी। तो मैं वहां छोड़ दिया जिस लिए कि यह दिला नहीं कर रहा था। हाँ"
10,You take the marijuana for any other reason other than to help with the anxiety.,symp/reasoning,148_10,T,crq,0.0,Tum marijuana use karne se chinta kam karne ke alava kisi aur wajah se kar rahe ho.
11,"I mean, like, if I'm bored or maybe if I'm like hanging out with buddies, like, I don't really have a reason not to do it. I can tell now, but it wasn't like, like, I really use it whenever I'm like feeling really anxious about something.",symp/reasoning,148_11,P,cd,-1.0,"Arre bhai, like, agar main bore ho raha hu ya fir mere buddies ke saath time pass kar raha hu, toh shayad main kuch karna hi nahi chahta. Ab toh main bata sakta hu, par pehle aisa nahi tha, main sach mein tabhi use karta tha jab main kisi cheez ke liye bahut zyada pareshan tha."
12,"So and you may not be able to answer this question, but if you didn't have any anxiety would that change your motivation to use marijuana?",symp/reasoning,148_12,T,cv,0.0,"शायद तुम इस सवाल का जवाब नहीं दे पाओगे, पर अगर तुम्हारी कोई चिंता न होती तो क्या तुम्हारी गांजा का उपयोग करने की प्रेर"
13,If I didn't have like any kind of anxiety?,inactive,148_13,P,crq,0.0,Agar mujhe koi bhi chinta na hoti toh?
14,Hmm,inactive,148_14,T,cd,0.0,Hmmm
15,"Umm like it was so be kind of tough to give up. Because like, if I'm hanging out with my buddies and they offer it to me like that's that's always pretty chill but I don't like I really I'm really looking forward to this job and like the benefits of having that job without weighing the benefits of just like smoking smoking with my buddies so",story,148_15,P,cr,-3.0,"Umm jaisey ki, itna mushkil tha chhodna. Kyuki, aggar main apney doston ke saath time guzar raha hu aur woh mujhey offer kar rahey hai toh woh hamesha suhana hota hai lekin mujhey asal mein iss naukri ki taraf intazaar hai aur iss naukri ke fayde ko dhoondney se mahatvapurna hai jaisey ki doston ke saath smoking karna."
16,so you're excited about the job?,inactive,148_16,T,crq,0.0,Kya tu naukri ke baare mein uthe hue hai?
17,"I am? Yeah, it's it's almost kind of a dream job.",inactive,148_17,P,cd,-1.0,"Mai hoon? Haan, yeh woh almost ek sapna jaisa hi hai job."

19,"Well, it's working with it's working with kids with autism in the school. So like, I would be kind of like, almost like a personal TA in a way. So like, it's part of an inclusion program. So when the kids are going into the class, like I would either sit with them or like maybe back behind the class and kind of like help them out in case something comes up. And it's just my brother has autism that's like it's that's something that I've always really kind of wanted to work with.",story,148_19,P,id,0.0,"Well, iski saath kaam ho raha hai, baccho ke saath school mein jinke paas autism hai. Toh aise mein, mai kisi tarah se personal TA ki tarah hounga. Aisa hai ki, ye ek inclusion program ka hissa hai. Jab bacche class mein ja rahe hote hain, tab mai unke saath baithega ya phir piche class mein aur unki madad karunga, agar kuch samasya aati hai. Aur mera bada bhai autism ki wajah se hai, isliye main hamesha se unke saath kaam karna chahta tha."
20,So it sounds like your real passion for this type of work.,inactive,148_20,T,crq,0.0,Toh lagta hai jaise ye teri asli pasand ka kaam hai.
21,Hmm,inactive,148_21,P,cd,0.0,Hmm iski
22,"And really, the big obstacle here is this marijuana?",symp/reasoning,148_22,T,irq,0.0,"Aur sacchi, yeh yahaan ka bada rok hai ki yeh marijuana hai?"
23,"It is it's like a catch 22 because it's like, I know the job will be great, but it's like it's a it's a big step for me to take that job. And it's, it's gonna be super umm It's gonna make me super anxious. You know, it's gonna be like, it's gonna be a lot of anxiety taking a new job. So it's like, if I have to give up the marijuana and then like, not have another way to cope with anxiety, like to get the job. It's like a catch 22",symp/reasoning,148_23,P,id,-1.0,"Isko waise hi jaise catch 22 hai kyonki mujhe pata hai ki yeh naukri bahut achhi hogi, lekin yeh bahut bada kadam hai mere liye ki main yeh naukri le lon. Aur phir, bahut khilon hu ke yeh mujhe behad pareshan karegi. Pata hai, aisa hai jaise ki, nayi naukri lekar pareshan bahut hota hai. Toh yeh jaise hai, agar main mariwana ko chhod kar phir aur koi tareeka nahi hai mere paas pareshani karne ke liye, toh naukri milni bhi muskil hai. Isliye yeh catch 22 ki tarah hai."
24,"Yeah, it's a predicament. You're kind of weighing both sides of this right. Now. I'm wondering. Do you have Do you think you'd have like a physical craving for the marijuana?",symp/reasoning,148_24,T,yq,0.0,"Haan, yeh ek maujoda hai. Tum dono taraf se iska wazan bhaar rahe ho. Ab. Mujhe yeh soch raha hoon. Kya tumhare paas marijuana ke liye ek sharirik taqat ka vaise hai?"
25,"No  I mean, not really No.",inactive,148_25,P,on,0.0,"Nahi yaar, main matalab nahi bilkul nahi."
26,So you're really using it recreationally and as an anti anxiety agent?,symp/reasoning,148_26,T,crq,0.0,Kya tum ise sachmuch manoranjan ke liye aur ek anti chinta aushadh ke roop mein istemal kar rahe ho?
27,"Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.",inactive,148_27,P,cd,0.0,"Haan, haan, bilkul."
28,"So if you were I know you didn't have great success before therapy, to combat anxiety, but if you were being treated for anxiety and working that job, which seems like you would really like do you think you'd be able to stay with the marijuana?",story,148_28,T,irq,0.0,"Agar agar aap I-hai toh mujhe pata hai ki aapko therapy se pehle badi success nahi mili thi, aur agar aap anxiety se ilaaj kar rahe the aur wo kaam kar rahe the, jo aapko bahut pasand hai, kya aapko lagta hai ki aap marijuana ke saath reh paate?"
29,"I think if the therapy really worked, I would be able to, like, it's just so easy now just to kind of light up. Like, that's an easy fix. And, like, I don't think therapy is going to be that instant. So like it would, it would be tough. I think if I had real confidence that the therapy would work, I could do it. But I mean, it was I have to it would definitely have to work like I just as well as as smoking. ",story,148_29,P,id,0.0,"मैं सोचता हूँ कि अगर थेरेपी वाकई काम कर जाती है, तो मुझे ये करने में सक्षम होना चाहिए, जैसे ही मेरे दमाग में ख़ामोशी होगी। जैसे, यह एक आसान ठीक काम है। लेकिन, मुझे लगता है कि थेरेपी तुरंत आराम नहीं देगी। इसलिए, मुझे सच्चे आत्मविश्वास का होना चाहिए कि थेरेपी होने पर ये काम हो सकता है। लेकिन, मैं मतलब हमेशा ये बात रखता हूँ कि मुझे पूरा भरोसा होना चाहिए कि थेरेपी सिगरेट से भी ज्यादा मददगार होगी।"
30,You would need to see results ?,inactive,148_30,T,crq,0.0,Tumhein results dekhne ki zaroorat padegi?
31,"Yeah, yeah, definitely",inactive,148_31,P,cd,0.0,"Haan, haan, zaroor"
32,would having the job that you're passionate about reduce your anxiety ?,inactive,148_32,T,yq,0.0,"क्या आपको उस नौकरी की ज़रूरत है जो आपको पसंद है, क्य"
33,"After a while, like after I got used to this job, but like just starting the new job would make me kind of anxious. And then like it would be tough not not to smoke or doing that. Like I don't I don't want to get on a drug test anymore because like it's it's being decriminalized being legalized so many places, and there's so much research, saying that it's not that bad. It's kind of like, it's really upsetting that the place that I really want to work sas that policy, I think it's really silly.",story,148_33,P,op,-1.0,"Withtimeplegable  Agle time ke baad, jab main is naukri se aadat lag gayi thi, lekin jab nayi naukri shuru hogi tab mujhe thoda sa ghabraahat ho sakti hai. Phir, dhoomrapaan na karne ki bhi mushkil ho sakti hai. Mujhe aur drug test pe nahi jaana hai kyunki uska legalization bahut jagah ho chuka hai aur bahut saare research ke mutaabik yeh itna bura nahi hai. Bahut afsos ki baat hai ki mujhe kaam karne ki ichha wali jagah us policy ko manti hai, mujhe lagta hai ki yeh bahut bakwaas hai."
34,you're frustrated. Marijuana is illegal.,inactive,148_34,T,crq,0.0,Tum frustrated ho. Marijuana illegal hai.
35,"Yeah, it's Yeah.",inactive,148_35,P,cd,-3.0,"Haan, yeh hai Haan."
36,"At the same time, it's the reality you're living in.",inactive,148_36,T,gc,0.0,"Wahi samay mein, yeh vaastavikta hai jo aap jee rahe hai."
37,"Right.. Yeah, it's either They will be legalized in like in the state in a couple of years. But until then, like,I mean, I can't wait that long to start start working so",story,148_37,P,gc,-1.0,"Haan, main samajh raha hoon, abhi wo legalized honge state mein kuch saalon mein. Lekin usse pehle, matlab, main itna lamba intezaar nahi kar sakta kaam shuru karne ke liye."
38,until then you still need to address this dilemma?,symp/reasoning,148_38,T,crq,0.0,Tab tak kya aapko iss sangharsh ka hal dhoona hoga?
39,"Right? Yeah, it's still a problem.",inactive,148_39,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan? Haan, ye abhi bhi ek samasya hai."
40,"So you have choices here, right.  You can continue to use the marijuana and not take the job. ",symp/reasoning,148_40,T,gc,0.0,"So here you have options, right. You can still continue using the marijuana and refuse to accept the job."
41,Hmm.,inactive,148_41,P,gc,0.0,Arre ya
42,"And that seems like something that has some advantages for you, but some, some disadvantages, right?",inactive,148_42,T,crq,0.0,"Aur vo kuch aisa lag raha hai jo tumhare liye kuch fayde toh lekin kuch kuch nuksaan bhi hain, na?"
43,Right,inactive,148_43,P,cd,0.0,Right
44,Because you would really like that job.,inactive,148_44,T,gc,0.0,Because tu sach mein us job ko pasand kar raha hai.
45,"Yeah. And I would, it's it sounds so pathetic to be like, No, I don't want to take my dream job because I need weed like, sounds really stupid.",symp/reasoning,148_45,P,gc,-1.0,"Haan. Aur main, yeh sunne mein itni dukhad am kyun hai ki, Nahi, mujhe apna sapna kaam nahi karna kyunki mujhe weed chahiye, bohot bekar lagta hai."
46,So where do you think you are in terms of making this change? Do you feel motivated to take some steps toward it?,inactive,148_46,T,irq,0.0,Tumhe yeh badlav karne mein kitni der lagi lagti hai? Kya tumhe hosla hai uss taraf kuch kadam uthane ka?
47,"I don't like I'm, I'm still kind of on the fence because like if I if I have to give it up for the job, I could do that. But I would definitely need, like some other way to get rid of all this anxiety. Like, whether it's therapy or whether it's like something else I yeah, I would, I would definitely need like a substitute if I got rid of it for good. ",symp/reasoning,148_47,P,id,-1.0,"Main job ke liye agar mujhe chodna padega toh main kar sakta hu, lekin mujhe ek tarah ki zaroorat hogi, jaise ki therapy ya phir kuch aur. Mujhe toh definitely koi na koi dusra upay chahiye, kyunki yeh sab anxiety se chutkara dila sakta hai."

49,Yeah,inactive,148_49,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
50,So you can't give up the marijuana unless you have some other available alternative that would help with that anxiety?,routine,148_50,T,yq,0.0,Toh kya tum marijuana chhod nahi sakte jab tak tumhare paas us matra parivartan ke liye koi aur upalabdh vikalp nahi hai jo us ghabrahat ke saath madad kar sakta?
51,Right.,inactive,148_51,P,op,0.0,Thik hai
52,That's that's key to you to make this change.,inactive,148_52,T,gc,0.0,Wohi tumhare liye yehi upaay hai is badalav ko karne ke liye.
53,"Yeah. Yeah, definitely. ",inactive,148_53,P,gc,0.0,"Haan. Haan, zaroor."
54,"But at the same time, that would be ideal, because then you could take the job.",inactive,148_54,T,gc,0.0,"Lekin wah bhale hi ho, par aisa hona accha hoga, kyunki phir tum kaam ko le sakte ho."
55,"Right? Yeah. I mean, I mean, if I really thought that I could, like get some kind of treatment that was as good as weed. Yeah, I mean, I could maybe quit, especially the house to get the job, especially.",inactive,148_55,P,gc,0.0,"Sahi toh? Haan. Main toh keh raha hoon, agar mujhe sach mein lagta ki main kisi aisi treatment se labh paa sakta hoon jo shisha ke jaisi hi acchi ho. Haan, main toh shayad chhod sakta hoon, khaas karke ghar ko chhod kar naukri ke liye."
56,"So with anxiety reduction, your chances of stopping marijuana increase, and then you could take the job that you want",routine,148_56,T,gc,0.0,"Isliye chinta kam karne se aapki maheen ke chahne se aapki maheen mein kami hai, fir aap woh naukri le sakte hain joh aap chahte hain."
57,"Yeah, yeah, I mean, that would be the best the best outcome.",inactive,148_57,P,gc,0.0,"Haan, haan, main mazaak nahi kar rahi, wo sabse achha result hoga."
58,Is that the outcome you would most want?,inactive,148_58,T,yq,0.0,Kya wo hi parinaam hai jo aap sab se zyaada chahte hain?
59,"Yeah, I think so. I think I could give up record, like, doing it with my buddies recreationally. I could, yeah, I'm just going to have a cigarette.",inactive,148_59,P,op,-1.0,"Haan, main sochta hu. Main record chhod sakta hu, jaise ki, apne dosto ke saath majak karne mein. Haan, main sirf ek cigarette peeyunga."
60,"So here's what I'm thinking. And let me know what you think about this. When you come back next week, right? What if we start looking at this anxiety? When we start, you know, I start treating anxiety. We'll see if we can get it reduced. And kind of work from there. Because maybe when you start to feel if that works, and that anxiety starts to abate, it sounds like it'll just be easier for you to stop the marijuana usage.",routine,148_60,T,gc,0.0,"""So ab kuch aisa soch raha hoon. Aur mujhe batao ki tum is bare mein kya sochte ho. Jab tum agle hafte lautte ho, thik hai? Kya agar hum is anxiety ko dekhna shuru kiya jaaye? Jab hum shuru karte hain, tum jaante ho, main anxiety ka ilaaj shuru karta hoon. Dekhenge ki kya hum use kam kar sakte hain. Aur phir, wahin se kaam shuru karenge. Kyunki shayad jab tum us cheez ka ehsaas hoga agar vo kaam karta hai, aur wo anxiety kam hone lage to tumhare liye mariyuana ka istemaal chordna aasan ho jayega."""
61,Yeah. Yeah.,inactive,148_61,P,gc,0.0,Haan. Haan.
62,What kind of timeframe Are you on in terms of taking this job?,inactive,148_62,T,irq,0.0,Kya tarikhke aadhar per tum job leneme ho?
63,"I mean, the job. It has a high turnover rate, so Like, even if I think I need to apply this week, but if I don't get in more than likely another position like it will open up, like within a month or two.",inactive,148_63,P,id,-1.0,"Maine firse, job dekho. Uska turnover rate bohot zyaada hai, toh Mera matlab hai, agar mujhe lagta hai ki main is week mein apply karna zaroori hai, par agar main select na ho, toh zyada tar koi aur similar position jald hi khul jaayega, kareeb ek mahine ke andar."
64,And when would they drug test you?,inactive,148_64,T,irq,0.0,Aur jab woh aapko drug test karenge?
65,"It would be like, Oh, all right after I apply, so I applied and then did the interview. That's when they will give him the paperwork. And I have to go get drug tested on.",inactive,148_65,P,id,-1.0,"Ya to vaise hoga, Accha, to maine apply kar diya, fir maine interview diya. Tabhi woh use paperwork dega. Aur mujhe drug test karana hoga."
66,And when did the last time you use Marijuana?,inactive,148_66,T,irq,0.0,Aur kab tak ho gaya tha aapne marijuana ka istemaal?
67,just a couple days ago.,inactive,148_67,P,id,0.0,Thoda din pehle hi.
68,To see what I'm getting that ?,inactive,148_68,T,irq,0.0,Mujhe voh dekhna hai ke main kya pa raha hoon?

But I would like to be off it by the next one.",inactive,148_69,P,id,0.0,"Han haan, yeh hai, wo uh, han. Toh main aisa hai ke main nahi kar paaunga, main is application ko bana nahi paaunga. Lekin main agle waale ke baad se isse off karna chahta hu."
70,So you're fortunate in the sense that the turnover is high,inactive,148_70,T,crq,0.0,"Toh aap bhagyashali hai,kyunki turnover kaafi zyada hai"
71,right,inactive,148_71,P,cd,0.0,ठी
72,Because it gives you an opportunity to apply later on. So do you feel like you can invest in that plan? Let's work on the anxiety. See what happened with the marijuana. See if we can Reduce your usage of it or have you stop that altogether? And then kind of move towards this job?,story,148_72,T,id,0.0,Kyonki yeh aapko baad mein laagu karne ka mouka deti hai. Toh kya aapko lagta hai ki aap uss yojana mein invest kar sakte ho? Chalo darr ko kam karte hain. Dekho marijuana ke saath kya hua. Dekhte hain kya hum uski upyog ki matra ko kam kar sakte hain ya phir bilkul band kar sakte hain? Aur phir iss naukri ki taraf jaate hain?
73,"Yeah, yeah, I could deal with that.",inactive,148_73,P,cd,0.0,"Haan, haan, main usse deal kar sakti hoon."

Toh agli baar jab aap aayenge, hum uss ubhrishi ke baare mein baat karenge. Aur dekhte hain hum kya kar sakte hain uske baare mein. Hum wahan se chalte hain."

Patient already had therapy for anxiety, but it was the initial stage, so it didn't make any difference. Patient doesn't have a reason not to consume marijuana. Patient used to do it whenever it feels like anxiety. Patient is confused between selecting the job or the marijuana. Therapist asked if the therapy started along with your dream job will you leave the marijuana.? If the therapy worked, the patient was fine to leave marijuana and smoking as well. Patient don't want to do a drug taste because it seems silly. Therapist asked to select an option like marijuana or a dream job. Patient still confused like patient needs dream job but also wants something to fight anxiety, whether its a marijuana or a therapy. Therapist told to have any other alternatives to fight anxiety to get the job. Patient told the therapist that patient would have only cigarette.  Therapist told the anxiety therapy will start from next week if the patient anxiety level is reduced. Because if it reduced it will be easy to quit marijuana.",,,,,
