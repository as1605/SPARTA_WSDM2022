1,"Yeah, I guess that's what we said last week, but I'm not really feeling it. I really feel it this time. You know, I, I, I know that I said I would do this, but I really haven't been able to stop thinking about it the whole week, and I am sure you know, my chest is tight. I almost didn't come I almost called and canceled. I just I don't really think that I can I can do this. I can't, I can't get in the car and drive over to that mall. If I walk inside, I know I am going to lose it. I imagine these I imagine these crowds of people, you know, going up and down and like, I almost feel like the walls are coming in on me when I start thinking about that. It's Just slow it down so to catch it we can still do this but it's we had agreed to sort of look for Mr. Anxiety and it looks like he's here. Oh, yeah, I found a big time. ",symp/reasoning,201_1,P,id,,"Yeah, mai maanta hu ki peechle hafte humne yahi kaha tha, lekin mujhe sach me lag nahi raha hai. Iss bar mai sach me mai mehsoos kar raha hu. Tum jaante ho, mai, mai, mai janta hu ki mai ne ye kaam karne ka bola tha, lekin mai sach me iske baare me sochna rok nahi paaya poora hafte, aur mai sure hu tum bhi jante ho, mere seene me bohot tangi hai. Mai paas aa hi nahi paya, mai almost phone karke cancel karne wala tha. Mai bas nahi lag raha hai ki mai ye kar sakta hu. Mai nahi kar sakte, mai car me baithke us mall tak jaa nahi sakta. Agar mai andar jaaunga, mai janta hu mai toot jaaunga. Mai yeh imagine karta hu, ki yaha par log bheed hai, upar neeche ghum rahe hai, aur mujhe lagta hai ki diwar mere taraf aane wale hai jab mai is baare me sochta hu. Bas use dheeli se karo, hum ye abhi bhi kar sakte hai, lekin humne sehmati se Mr. Anxiety ko dhoondhne ka decide kiya tha aur lag raha hai wo yaha par hai. Oh, haan, mai bada waqt se dhoondh raha hu use."
2,"Yeah. And minister asked you this as you start to enter into this, is this familiar? Is this a familiar territory?",symp/reasoning,201_2,T,yq,,"Haan. Aur minister ne aapse yeh poocha jab aap isme pravesh shuru karte ho, kya yeh aapke liye parichit hai? Kya yeh parichit kshetra hai?"
3,"Yeah, this is me all the time. That's why I came here in the first place, right. So we've been kind of working on trying to stand in a different way to it but now we're actually going to do something and here it is big time.",story,201_3,P,op,,"Haan, yeh hai woh sabse durr tak. Isiliye main yahaan pehle se hi aaya hoon, samjhe. Toh hum koshish kar rahe hain ki kuch aur tareeke se khade ho saken, lekin ab hum sach mein kuch karenge aur yahaan bohot bada mauka hai."
4,Very familiar would you say?,inactive,201_4,T,yq,,Kya tumhe yeh bahut hi pahchana lagega?
5,"Yeah, that's very familiar. It's very disconcerting as well.",inactive,201_5,P,op,,"Haan, woh bohot familiar hai. Lekin woh bohot disturbing bhi hai."
6,"Sure. Yeah.  How old would you say those thoughts are like that what you just said do you did you notice there was like an urgency to it they kind of went one after another after another after another like like one led to another another I'm, this is going to happen when I get there, then this is going to happen with me. ",symp/reasoning,201_6,T,id,,"Pakka. Haan. Yaar. Kitni umar honi chaiye un thoughts ki jaise ki tumne abhi kaha tha kya tumne notice kiya tha ki usme urgency thi woh ek ke baad ek ke baad ek ke baad chale gaye jaise ki ek se doosre ko lead karte rahe aur mujhe pahuchte hi yeh hoga, fir yeh mere saath hoga."
7,"Mm hmm. Yeah, no, I see what you're saying.",inactive,201_7,P,ack,,"Hm ji. Haan, nahi, main samajh raha hoon ki aap kya keh rahe hain."
8,And how old is this whole little  I don't mean those exact words. But kind of mmaamma ?,inactive,201_8,T,irq,,"Aur yeh whole little kitne saal ke hai? Main na, woh exact words nahi sense kar raha. Lekin, mmaamma jaisa kuch?"
9,"I used to happen to him when I was when I was a kid. You know, when, even when I was, you know, before I was a teenager, okay, same same kind of thing. You know, like, my parents would try to take me out to some public place and, you know, mall or street fair or something, and I just, you know, in the car on the way over, I'd be I'd be a wreck. ",symp/reasoning,201_9,P,id,,"Main baachpan mein uske saath aisa hota tha. Pata hai, jab main, aap jaante hain, jab main ek teenager se pahle thi, thik hai, waise hi ho jaata tha. Pata hai, mere mummy papa koshish karte the ki mujhe kisi public jagah leke jayein, mall ya street fair par, aur main, aap jaante hain, car mein baithke, main bahut pareshaan ho jaata tha."
10,Okay. So this has a history.,inactive,201_10,T,crq,,Okay. Iski to ek itihaas hai.
11,Yeah.,inactive,201_11,P,cd,,Haan.
12,"Would it be fair to say that what you have been doing is sort of turning over your life to that, whatever that was. And you've come in here. We've been working now for these weeks. Getting ready for this moment to try to create a space in which something different can happen.",routine,201_12,T,irq,,"Kya yeh sahi hoga ki jo tum kar rahe ho woh thoda sa apne zindagi ko us cheez ki taraf palatna hai, jo bhi woh ho. Aur tum yahan aa gaye ho. Hum is samay se kaam kar rahe hain. Iss pal ko taiyaar karne ke liye jisme kuch naya ho sakta hai."
13,"That was that was what I hope to do. Yeah, I I've missed out on a lot because because I can't, you know, I can't I can't keep it together enough to, you know, do the stuff that other people do. ",symp/reasoning,201_13,P,id,,"""Main yahi chahti hoon ki main kar sakoon. Haan, main bahut kuch miss kar gayi hoon kyunki main nahi kar sakti, pata hai, main itna sambhal nahi sakti ki, pata hai, dusron ke tarah kaam kar sakoon."""
14,Okay,inactive,201_14,T,ack,,Achha
15,go to places other people go.,inactive,201_15,P,id,,Chalo dusro ke jaane ke
16,"Okay, so now we're up on or right up on where the action happens. Like what do you do when you have thoughts like what you just had? Because you're not there yet. We're not yet actually in the situation where those things are happening yet. But we are right here where those things are being conceived with me on this?",routine,201_16,T,yq,,"Okay, toh ab hum up par hain ya up par hain jaha waapas kaam hota hai. Jaise ki jab aapke paas vichaar hote hain jaise abhi aapke the. Kyunki aap abhi tak vahaan nahi hain. Hum abhi tak vahaan nahi hain jahaan ye cheezein ho rahi hain abhi tak. Lekin hum yahaan hain jahaan in cheezon ki shuruwat ki jaati hai mere saath aap ke saath?"
17,"Yeah, I think I see. ",inactive,201_17,P,op,,"Haan, main sochti hoon ki mujhe samajh aa raha hai."
18,"Okay. So what can we see this sort of kind of slow this down and watch it? We're about to do something and here it comes. Could we take Can I just do something I want to I want to do something. In terms of creating a history. I want to create a history right here, instead of cap something like what this would. What does how the mind works? Hmm, could we do something kind of odd? You're gonna play so let me do something.",routine,201_18,T,yq,,"Accha. To kya hum iss tarah se thoda dheere dheere ye dekh sakte hain aur dekh paayenge? Hum kuch karne waale hain aur wo ab aane waala hai. Kya hum wo cheez kar sakte hain jo main karna chahta hoon? Main kuch karna chahta hoon. Ek itihaas banana ke liye. Main yahaan ek itihaas banana chahta hoon, iss se pehle ki kuch aur karne waale hain. Yeh kaise kaam karta hai dimaag? Hmm, kya hum thoda ajeeb kuch kar sakte hain? Aap khelne waale hain, to main kuch karne doon."
19,"Yeah, if you want as well. ",inactive,201_19,P,op,,"Haan, agar teri ichha ho toh."
20,"Okay, okay. I've got a pen here. ",inactive,201_20,T,id,,"Thik hai, thik hai. Mujhe yaha ek pen mil gaya hai."
21,"Yes, you do. ",inactive,201_21,P,ack,,"Haan, tumhe yaad hai."

23,"The pen says Whoo,",inactive,201_23,P,id,,Pen bolta hai Whoo.
24,okay. What does it say?,inactive,201_24,T,crq,,thik hai. yeh kya kehta hai?
25,"It says, whoo. ",inactive,201_25,P,cd,,"Ye kehta hai, whoo."
26,"Okay, we just did it twice. You suppose if I come back in here next week, we sit down I said versus say, What? What do you think and said",routine,201_26,T,cd,,"Theek hai, humne abhi do baar kiya. Tum socho agar main agle hafte yaha wapas aata hu, hum baithenge aur maine kaha vice-versa, hai-na? Tum kya samajhte ho aur kaha."
27,"Yeah, I'll say it as whoo. ",inactive,201_27,P,cd,,"Haan, main whoo keh kar hi rahunga."
28,And next month?,inactive,201_28,T,yq,,Aur agla mahine?
29,I'll probably still say whoo huh,inactive,201_29,P,id,,mai sabko milega bahut kuch pata nahi I guess
30,"How about next year, is it possible. We just did like 15 seconds. Is it possible next year, that might come to mind if I said this thing",routine,201_30,T,irq,,"Agar agle saal, ho sakta hai. Humne bas 15 seconds mein kiya tha. Ho sakta hai agle saal, yeh baat yaad aa jaaye agar maine yeh baat kahi ho."
31,"Yeah, probably still I'd probably still say whoo.",routine,201_31,P,id,,"Haan, shayad main abhi bhi kahun gi whoo."
32,"But as long as you've struggled with this with the way the mind works, what do you think is going to happen as we come to this day?",routine,201_32,T,irq,,"पर जब तक आप दिमाग के साथ इससे लड़ रहे हो, तब ताक आपको यह लगता है कि जब हम इस दिन तक पहुंचेंगे तो क्या होने वाला है?"
33,"Oh, I see. So I've, I've been thinking for years that that I'll lose it if I get, get into a crowd and hear what's happening again, and I'm thinking about, you know,",symp/reasoning,201_33,P,id,,"Oh, I see. So maine, maine saaloon se soch raha tha ki main apni jaan kho doonga agar main bheed mein jaata aur phir se kya ho raha hai, aur main soch raha hu, pata hai,"
34,"exactly, if that's if that's the determine, determine if that's what we're going to turn it over tomean, we're, we're never like inside Letting that run your life is what brought you in here. Think of all the cost that it's produced. So let's see if we can do something different. I got a ticket ticket a moment to sort of get in touch with how old this is. And the cost associated with me on this  yeah. This pen goes?",routine,201_34,T,id,,"Jis tarah se agar woh decide hua hai, decide karein ki kya woh cheez jo hum use karenge usko samajh payenge to hum andar aa jayenge. Apne jeevan mein us par istemaal karna, yahi humein yahan pe le aaya hai. Socho ki kitni cost yeh paida ki hai. Toh chalo dekhte hain kuchh alag kar sakte hain. Mujhe ek aur pal ki zaroorat hai iss baat se door jaane ke liye ki yeh kitna purana hai. Aur mujhse kitni cost ho rahi hai iss par. Yeh pen chalta hain kya?"

So it's like we're here And we're right on this pivot point where we're going to do something different. And here's the thing I'd like to ask you. It's different, but With regard to that, would you be willing to do this and as you go, you can tell me what's coming coming up. I want you to actually watch your mind go as it constructs those scary futures and just notice it. Like, sort of like the way you carry something that's fragile. wants you to just to set a notice.
