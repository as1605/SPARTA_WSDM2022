0,Has it made you rethink your entire job in the profession?,inactive,133_0,T,id,,Kya yah aapko apni poore tanke aur peshe mein job ko dobaara sochne par majboor kar diya?
1,"Yeah, I mean, it's making me think like, you know, if I just had some desk job, like if I just crunched numbers or something, I would never have to have this responsibility. Like, why would they trust me with a job like this? Like, I'm just a human being who, you know, doesn't know any better than any other person and I just don't know if I can do this. It's just so much responsible. And I guess, I guess before I felt like I could handle it. And now I just feel like it's so much responsibility for one person. And I don't think that I can handle it anymore. But I don't want to change jobs because I've been here for so long. And I liked it before. I don't know.",symp/reasoning,133_1,P,id,-2.0,"Haan, matlab, mujhe sochne pe majboor kar raha hai ki, you know, agar mere paas bas koi table-waale kaam hota, jaise ki agar main sirf numbers daba ke kaam karun ya kuchh aur, toh mujhe ye zimmedari kabhi nahi hoti. Aisa kyun ki, kyun wo mujh par itna bharosa karein ki mai ek aise kaam ke liye layak hoon? Mai toh bas ek insaan hoon, jo kisi se zyaada nahi jaanta aur main nahi jaanta ki kya mai ye kar sakta hoon. Itni badi zimmedari hai. Aur main samajh sakta tha pehle ki main isse nibha sakta hoon. Lekin ab lag raha hai ki ye zimmedari ek aadmi ke liye bahut zyada ho gayi hai. Aur mujhe lagta hi nahi ki mai ab iska muqabla kar sakta hoon. Lekin mujhe kaam badalna nahi hai kyunki main yahan itni dino se hoon. Aur mujhe pehle pasand tha. Main nahi jaanta."
2,you're fearful of this happening again.,symp/reasoning,133_2,T,crq,,Tum phir se isse darr rahe ho.
3,"Yes,",inactive,133_3,P,cd,,"Haan,"
4,And how you may handle it? what may happen?,symp/reasoning,133_4,T,irq,,Aur aap isse kaise nibha sakte ho? Kya ho sakta hai?
5,"I feel like it's just around the corner. And this isn't even resolved. I'm still afraid of the consequences of this, you know, like, what if, you know, you know, these kids are out of their parents home. And I just feel like what if something bad happens to them where they are now and then that's going to fall on me and, you know, people, like other my co workers know that I'm the one that did this. So like, if something happens to the kids, like, I'm going to be the one that they're going to blame for it.",symp/reasoning,133_5,P,id,-2.0,"arre yaar, humesha ki tarah ab ye bas kisi kone me hi hoga. Aur ye toh abhi bhi hal nahi hua hai. Mujhe abhi bhi is cheez ke natije se dar lagta hai, pata hai na, kya hoga agar, pata hai na, pata hai na, ye bachche apne maa baap ke ghar se bahar hai. Aur mujhe bas yahi lag raha hai, agar unke saath kuch bura ho jata hai abhi, toh phir blame mujh pe hi padega aur meri co-workers bhi pata chal jayenge main hi wajah hun. Ab agar bachchon ko kuch ho jata hai toh, mujh pe hi wo blame karenge."
6,"So just to make sure, I understand your Report. So they were engaging in these behaviors. And your report, just what precipitated the them being broken up.",symp/reasoning,133_6,T,id,,"Toh bas yeh pakka karne ke liye ki main aapki Report samajhta hoon. Toh unhone yeh karmchari kuch aise karte the. Aur aapki report, yeh batati hai ki unhe kis baat ke baad alag kiya gaya tha."
7,"Yeah. Because, you know, before that, I guess, you know, probably nobody else would have known about it. So I made the report about what was going on. And I think Yeah, as a direct result.",story,133_7,P,ack,,"Haan. Kyunki, pata hai na, usse pahle, mujhe lagta hai, shayad kisi aur ko iske baare mein pata na ho. To maine report banayi thi uske baare mein ki kya ho raha tha. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki haan, yahi uska direct parinaam hai."
8,"Alright, let's, let's take a look at the habits, right. So, in CBT, we like to evaluate evidence and try to look at the facts as we understand them. And really, we want to scrutinize and carefully review the facts and the evidence and hold a light to it and try to figure out what's going on. Right. What would have happened with this family if you hadn't work, no one intervened?",routine,133_8,T,id,,"Thik hai, chalo dekhte hai ki kya habits hai, tik hai. Toh, CBT mein humein evidence ko evaluate karne ka shauk hai aur hum try karte hai ki facts ko hamara point of view se dekhen. Aur sach mein, hum chahte hai ki hum closely examine karein facts aur evidence ko, unhe analyze karein aur unke upar light dalein aur usse samajhne ki koshish karein ki kya ho raha hai. Thik hai. Agar aap kaam nahi karte toh kya is family ke saath hota aur koi bhi intervention nahi hota?"
9,"I don't know. I mean, it wasn't going great for the kids. It wasn't really great environment. But I just feel like if I had left it alone, I don't know that the kids would be with their parents.",symp/reasoning,133_9,P,id,-2.0,"Mujhe nahi pata. Matlab, bachcho ke liye sab kuch theek nahi tha. Yeh sach mein accha mahaul nahi tha. Lekin main bas yeh mehsoos karti hoon ki agar main isko akela chhod deti, toh shayad bachche apne parents ke saath na hote."
10,"So they all be together. And you feel like, right now. He's saying with them being a part. That sounds good. Is that fair together?",symp/reasoning,133_10,T,irq,,"Toh voh sab saath honge. Aur tumhe lagta hai, abhi. Voh unke saath part hone ka keh raha hai. Voh accha lagta hai. Kya yeh ek saath sahi hai?"
11,"Yeah, I mean, I guess. I guess I feel like it's probably wasn't great for them to be there. I mean, that's why I made the report. That's my job, but it just feels like, you know, I just feels like I'm playing God. You know what I mean? Like, I'm just coming in here and spend like 5-10 minutes with a family and then totally turn their whole world upside down.",symp/reasoning,133_11,P,id,-2.0,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai, aisa hi hoga. Mujhe lagta hai ki unke liye wahan hona bahut achha nahi hua hoga. Main apna farmana dene ke liye hi toh report banaaya hai. Ye mera kaam hai, par itna sab karke mujhe lagta hai ki main Bhagwan ki tarah ho raha hun. Kya aap samajh rahe hain? Jaise ki main yahan aa kar, ek family ke saath 5-10 minute bitaa kar, unke poore jeevan ko ulta kar deti hun."
12,"you have a tremendous amount of power And if you misuse that power, you could devastate families. That's maybe what you You think happened to you? ",routine,133_12,T,crq,,"Tumhare paas ek badi maatra mein taakat hai. Aur agar tum uss taakat ka galat istemaal karo, toh tum parivaaron ko nuksan pahuncha sakte ho. Shayad yeh tumhare saath hua hai?"
13,Yeah.,inactive,133_13,P,op,,Haan.
14," So going back to what would have happened to them, let me just step back there for a moment. They would still be together without your intervention. And that could be a positive. What about consequences that maybe were negative?",routine,133_14,T,id,,"Toh jaate hai, unke saath kya ho sakta tha, main ek pal ke liye peeche hat jaun. Agar aapka haath na hota, toh abhi bhi woh saath hote. Aur yeh ek accha hoga. Par kya unki pahunche ke consequences bhi negative the?"
15,"Well, I mean, like I said, I thought they were using drugs in the home. So that's like a really dangerous situation for kids to be in, because you don't know what kind of people are coming in and out of the home, if their parents are going to be, you know, coherent enough to help them if there's an emergency or if the parents are even making them food and taking care of their needs and stuff like that. So I guess in that sense, that's really concerning. And that's a big part of the reason why I made the report.",symp/reasoning,133_15,P,id,,"Arrey, main toh yeh bol rahi thi, ki mujhe lag raha tha ki ghar mein dawaaiyaan istemaal ho rahi hain. Toh yeh bachchon ke liye ek bohot hi khatarnaak sthiti hai, kyunki tumhe pata nahi hota ki ghar mein kaun-kya log aa rahe hain aur ghar se bahar nikal rahe hain, ya agar unke ma-baap unhe madad dene ke liye hoshiyar hain ya nahi, aur kya unke ma-baap unhe khaana bana rahe hain aur unki zarooriyaat ki dekhbhaal kar rahe hain aur aise hi cheezein. Toh iss tarah se, yeh bohot hi chintaajanak hai. Aur issi wajah se maine report banayi."
16,"You made the report because it's your responsibility, but also you had concerns about their welfare. If you could go back and do it again. would you change anything?",story,133_16,T,id,,"Tumne report banaya kyunki yeh tumhara zimmedari tha, lekin iske alawa tumhe chinta thi unki kalyankari ki. Agar tum wapis jaake ise dobara karte, toh kya tum kuch badalna chahoge?"
17,"I don't know. I guess that's just the hardest part for me is like, I feel like I can't make the right decision. I just feel like I don't know if I'm equipped to be the person to make that kind of decision.",symp/reasoning,133_17,P,id,-2.0,"Mujhe nahi pata. Mujhe lagta hai yeh mere liye sabse mushkil hissa hai, mujhe aisa lagta hai ke main sahi faisla nahi kar sakta. Mujhe yeh mehsoos hota hai ke kya main uss tarah ka faisla lena ke liye kabil hu ya nahi."
18,"So you don't know if you made a good decision or not. And further, you question your ability going forward to make decisions. ",symp/reasoning,133_18,T,crq,,"Tumhe nahi pata hai ki tumne ek achha faisla kiya hai ya nahi. Aur iss se aage, tum apni yogyata par shankit ho kar faislo ko lene mein iss dete ho."
19,"Yeah, definitely. That's the uncertainty, anxiety.",symp/reasoning,133_19,P,ack,,"Haan, bilkul sahi. Yeh toh anishchitata, chinta hai."
