3,"Well, I've really just been feeling kind of anxious every time I go to work.",symp/reasoning,16_3,P,id,,Ab main toh sach much kaam jaane se pehle hamesha thoda anxious feel karta hu.
4,"feeling anxious every time you go to work, what type of place to work.",routine,16_4,T,crq,,"Har waqt jab aap kaam par jaate hain, aapko chinta hone lagti hai, kaam karne ke liye kaisa sthan hai."
5,"I work just an insurance company, sort of an admin assistant.",routine,16_5,P,cd,,"मैं एक इंश्योरेंस कंपनी में काम करता हूँ, जैसे ही"
6,Work for insurance company and how long have you been feeling anxious? there?,symp/reasoning,16_6,T,irq,,तुम कितने समय से इंश्योरेंस कंपनी में काम कर रहे हो और क्या तुम
7,"Well, I've started a little over a year ago.",symp/reasoning,16_7,P,id,,"Arre, I started ek kone se ek saal pahle."
8,Have you ever had anxiety like that? A previous employer or any other place?,symp/reasoning,16_8,T,crq,,Kya tere paas aisi chinta hai? Koi purva-prajyadeshik ya koi aur jagah?
9,"Yeah, I would say when I've started new jobs or even in new academic environments, I would feel somewhat anxious. So",symp/reasoning,16_9,P,cd,,"Haa, main kehta hun ki jb maine naye jobs shuru kiya ya naye academic environments main aaya, mujhe thoda anxious feel hota tha."
10,"this is somewhat familiar, exciting. Mm hmm. Tell me about things I,",routine,16_10,T,gc,,"yeh kuch familiar sa hai, bahut exciting. Mm hmm. Mujhe baat karo about things I,"
11,"um, well, it starts you know, when I wake up in the morning and get ready to go to work, even when I'm driving in, I just start to get anxious. And then once I'm there, I really just, you know, I go to work and I do what I'm supposed to do, but I try to keep to myself. You know, I don't really enjoy interacting with some of my co workers and",story,16_11,P,gc,,"मैं, अच्छा, ये शुरू होता है जब मैं सुबह उठता हूँ और काम के लिए तैयार होता हूँ, और जब मैं ड्राइव करता हूँ, तो मैं चिंतित होने लगता हूँ। और जब मैं वहाँ पर होता हूँ, तो मैं वाकई सिर्फ, आप जानते हैं, काम करने जाता हूँ और जो मुझे करना चाहिए, लेकिन मैं सिर्फ अपने आप से ही रहता हूँ। आप जानते हैं, मुझे कुछ मेरे सहयोगियों से मिलकर बातच"
12,what is it that happens when you try to interact with,routine,16_12,T,irq,,Kya hota hai jab aap koshish karte hain interact karne ki?
13,"um, I guess I just, I haven't really connected with any of them and I, I tend to worry about whether I'm doing my job right or if they like me, things like that. So it's just easier to stick to my my own office.",routine,16_13,P,id,,"Um, main sochta hoon ki main abhi tak kisi se bhi jude nahi hoon aur mujhe, mujhe yeh fikr hai ki kya main apna kaam sahi kar raha hoon ya kya woh mujhe pasand karte hain, aise hi cheezein. Isliye apne apne office mein rehna aasan hai."
14,"Okay, so you have an office have separate offices. And you find yourself maybe isolating a little bit. Yeah,",routine,16_14,T,crq,,"Toh, aap ke paas ek office hai jisme alag se alag offices hain. Aur aap khud ko thoda sa alag karne ko dhundhte hain. Haan, na?"
15,I guess you could say that.,routine,16_15,P,cd,,मुझे लगता है कि तुम कह सकते
16,"So what is the what is your experience of anxiety when you're kind of? I'm sure there are situations and diaries, more or less have to interact with other people to limit your experience of anxiety.",routine,16_16,T,irq,,"Toh ab bataiye, aapko anxiety ka anubhav kaisa lagta hai jab aap thoda sa hai? Mai sure hu ki aapke paas aise halat aur jamane honge, jahan aapko dusro se milna hai aur aapki anxiety ko kam karna hai."
17,You mean how I'm feeling or what type of situations that happens in?,routine,16_17,P,crq,,Tumhara matlab mujhe kaisa lag raha hai ya kis tarah ki sthitiyan hoti hain?
18,"Well, let's cover both. Let's start with what type of situations triggers it",routine,16_18,T,cd,,"Arey, chalo dono cover karenge. Shuru karte hain ki kis tarah ki situations se yeh triggered hota hai."
19,"Okay, um, I guess whenever I'm in a big crowd, purchase with a bunch of coworkers. If we have meetings or they ask for my input on input on something, I tend to get nervous and I just wonder, you know, if I'm saying the right thing, and then that sort of makes me get nervous around them. And then when I start to feel nervous, I get some stomach pains. I really would prefer just to stop talking, stop the meeting. And then I get, you know, a little red and blush, as well, whenever we have meetings.",story,16_19,P,id,,"Thik hai, um, mujhe lagta hai jab bhi main ek badi bheed mein hoon, jahan mere saathi hote hain. Agar hamare meetings hote hain ya mujhse kisi cheez par mera input puchha jaata hai, toh main ghabra jaata hoon aur sochta hoon, pata nahi main sahi kuchh keh raha hoon ya nahi, aur phir mujhe unke beech mein nervous hone lagta hai. Aur jab mujhe nervous hona shuru hota hai, toh mujhe kuchh pachakarta hui mahsoos hota hai. Main sach mein kuchh bhi bolna pasand nahi karta, meetings rokna chahta hoon. Aur phir main, haan, meetings karne ke time main thoda laal aur sharminda ho jaata hoon."
20,Do you ever have a desire to leave? Like if you're in a group just to kind of exterior?,routine,16_20,T,irq,,"Kya tumhe kabhi leaving ki ichcha hoti hai? Jaise ki tum group mein ho, bas dikhava karne ke liye?"
21,"Oh, yeah, all the time. Um, I try not to because I don't want to do a bad job and I don't, you know, I don't want to perform poorly. But sometimes the anxiety just takes over a little bit, and I just would prefer to go back to my office and be by myself.",routine,16_21,P,id,,"Haan, sabhi samay. Hmm, main yeh nahi koshish karta kyonki mujhe accha kaam nahi karna hai aur mujhe, pata hai, main kharab tarike se kaam nahi karna chahta. Lekin kabhi kabhi chinta bas thodi si bhaag leti hai, aur mujhe bas apne office mein vapas jaana aur akela rehna pasand hoga."
22,"And how distressing is this for you? I mean, obviously, you're here. So it must be some level of distress but how disruptive is it to your functioning?",routine,16_22,T,irq,,"Aur ye aapke liye kitna dukhdai hai? Mera matlab hai, dikhne mein toh aap yahaan hai. Toh hoga kuch na kuch dukh, lekin aapke karya-kriya par kitni bhrashtachaar hai?"
23,"Why would say I'm, you know, when I drive into work, you know, like it's I feel anxious every day and I've really just been thinking about leaving my job and finding something else where I can potentially even be more secluded and not have to go to meetings frequently or make presentations or anything like that.",symp/reasoning,16_23,P,id,,"Kyon ki jab main kaam par jaata hun to mujhe har din anxious feel hota hai aur main jobs chhod kar kuch aur dhoondhne ke baare mein soch raha hun. Waise mujhe aur jyaada secluded job mil jaaye to accha hoga, jahan mujhe frequent meetings ya presentations dena na pade."
24,So meetings and presentations in particular trigger.,symp/reasoning,16_24,T,crq,,Meeting aur presentations mein khaas karke trigger hota hai.
25,"I was saying, Yeah, I would say so. Anything where a lot of people are looking at me more than a few, I guess you could say.",routine,16_25,P,cd,,"Main bol raha tha, Yeah, main kahunga hi. Kuch bhi jahan bahut saare log mujhe thodi si se zyada dekh rahe hain, main samajhta hun aap kah sakte hain."
26,"Can you tell me a little bit more about the physical symptoms? You mentioned your stomach hurt, when you feel anxious? Is there any other any other symptoms going on? You could feel physically,",routine,16_26,T,irq,,"Kya aap mujhe thoda aur batayenge physical symptoms ke baare mein? Aapne bataaya ki aapko pet dard hota hai, kya aapko ghabrahat hone par? Kya aur koi saare symptoms hain? Aap physically mehsoos kar sakte hain, na?"
27,"um, well, sometimes my palms will get sweaty, my face will get red or I'll get overheated. But mostly it's just some stomach pains leading up to you know, throughout the day, like if I'm thinking about what I have to do, that makes me anxious I'll start to get some stomach pains.",routine,16_27,P,id,,"Umm, well, Kabhi Kabhi meri paalme pasi aa jaati h, meri chehre ki rangat laal ho jaati h ya main garmi se ghabra jaati hu. Lekin aksar mera pait dard shuru ho jaata h jaane k lie, pure din, jaise agar mai apne krna h kya soch rhi hu, toh mujhe anxciety hoti h aur mere pait mein dard shauru ho jaata h."
28,"So when these anxiety episodes are more intense, like when you when your stomach hurts, and you have other symptoms, Are you worried about it happening again? Like, are you worried that those symptoms are gonna occur again, that makes you have more symptoms?",routine,16_28,T,crq,,"So jab yeh anxiety episodes zyada intense hote hain, jaise jab aapki stomach hurts hoti hai, aur aapko aur bhi kuchh lakshan hote hain, Kya aap is baare mein pareshan hai ki ye phir se ho sakta hai? Jaise, kya aap fikr karte hain ki un lakshanon ka dobara hone se aapko aur bhi zyada lakshan ho sakte hain?"
29,"I'm not always worried about it happening again. I mean, sometimes I can anticipate it happening. And I would like to avoid it. But I would say here and there, I would worry about getting the stomach pains or blushing in front of people, things like that, but it's not every time.",routine,16_29,P,cd,,"Mere ko hamesha se fikar nahi hai ki yeh dobara ho jayega. Matlab kabhi kabhi mujhe ahsaas hota hai ki yeh ho sakta hai. Aur main ise bachna chahta hoon. Lekin yahan wahan pay, main pet dard ya logon ke samne laaj aa jane ki chinta karta hoon, lekin har bar nahi hota."
30,Tell me about the meetings that you have. You mentioned that you have meetings you have to go to expected. How many people be in a typical meeting?,routine,16_30,T,irq,,Mujhe apne meetings ke bare mein batao. Tumne kaha ki tumhe jaane ke liye meetings hai. Aam tor par kitne log ek meeting mein hote hai?
31,"Well, it's a pretty small company, but I would say probably anywhere between five and 10. Most of them are above me though. their positions are above me So,",routine,16_31,P,id,,"Accha, yeh ek kaafi chhota company hai, lekin shayad lagbhag paanch se das tak. Adhikansh logo ki haisiyat abhi mere se upar hai. Unki haisiyat meri se upar hai."
32,so five to 10 how often these meetings scheduled,routine,16_32,T,irq,,So panch se dus tak yeh meetings kitni baar schedule hote hain?
33,"About once or twice a week regularly, and then sometimes we might meet more than that if something needs to be addressed.",routine,16_33,P,id,,Ek baar ya do baar hafte mein nirdhaarit roop se aur kabhi kabhi hum zyada baar mil sakte hain agar kuch sambhaalne ki zaroorat ho.
34,"Right, so somewhat unplanned.",routine,16_34,T,crq,,"Right, toh thoda sa aniyamit."
35,Mm hmm. And then some happen weekly. Okay.,routine,16_35,P,cd,,Haan aur phir kuch hafte me ho jaata hai. Thik hai.
36,"So for the ones that are planned, you get anxious in advanced welcome.",routine,16_36,T,crq,,"So, jinke liye plan banaye gaye hain, unke liye aap pehle se hi pareshan ho jaate ho, aapko swagat karte huye."
37,"Oh, yeah, definitely. I mean, I think about it, as soon as I know, I always know it's coming. So I'm always thinking about, you know, the next meeting that I'll have to present at or how I'll have to contribute. And then I just sort of I think about it until it happens, and then it's a cycle.",story,16_37,P,cd,,"Haa, haan, zaroor. Mera matlab, jab main sochti hoon, toh jaise hi mujhe pata chalta hai, main hamesha jaanti hoon ki woh aane wala hai. To main hamesha sochti rehti hoon, aane wali meeting ke baare mein ya phir yeh sochti hoon ki main kaise contribute karungi. Phir bas main uske baare mein sochti rehti hoon jab tak yeh haqiqat nahi ho jaati hai, phir woh ek chakkar ban jaata hai."
38,"All right. So the meetings triggered, generally not being isolated in the office kind of triggers this anxiety. Right. But there's other times it sounds like we're not anxious when you're isolating the office. How would have hungry anxious now? ",routine,16_38,T,irq,,"Sab thik hai. Toh meeting shuru hui, generally ghar mein isolated hone se anxiety ka trigger ho jata hai. Sahi hai. Lekin kabhi kabhi lagta hai ki hum ghabraaye nahi jab hum office mein isolated hai. Aise waqt mein hum kaise hungry aur anxious ho sakte hai?"
39,I'm not really when I'm by myself. I don't really feel anxious.,routine,16_39,P,id,,मैं खुद के साथ होने पर नहीं होने से वास्तव में नहीं हूँ|
40,"So really, it's when you get up for work and start thinking about the work day, especially if they're meetings, right? That sort of starts to,",routine,16_40,T,orq,,"Toh sach mein, aap kaam ke liye uthte hai aur kaam ki sochne lagte hai, vishesh roop se agar meetings hai, na? Wo tarah se shuru ho jata hai."
41,"yeah, like if I have off work for a couple of days, I don't feel anxious at all. It's really just when I'm going to work when I know that I'm going to have to be talking to a lot of people or making presentations, things like that.",routine,16_41,P,od,,"Haan, agar mere ko kuch dino ke liye off mil jaye, tab mujhe koi ghabrahat nahi hoti. Sach me, yeh sirf tab hota hai jab mai kaam ke liye jaa raha hoon aur mujhe pata hota hai ki mujhe kafi logo se baat karna hoga ya presentation dena hoga, aise kaam."
42,So you suffer the anxiety advance of these plan meetings? How about the unplanned meetings? What's your experience of those?,routine,16_42,T,irq,,Kya tum plan meetings ke anxiety advance ka saamna karte ho? Aur unplanned meetings ke baare mein kya kehte ho? Unke baare mein tumhara kya anubhav hai?
43,"Well, I mean, unplanned meetings, I, I don't really have a lot of time to think about them happening. But I would say even when I'm put on the spot and have to present anything or just even having a long discussion where a lot of people are looking at me or you know, listening to me for a long period of time, I would still say I get pretty anxious about that as well.",routine,16_43,P,id,,"Haan dekho, koi bhi beparwah meetings hote hain, toh mujhe thodi si sochne ki samay nahi hota hai. Par main kahunga, jab bhi mujhe jhat se kuchh present karna ho ya fir lambi charcha ho, jahan bahut saare log mujhe dekh rahe hon ya mujhe lamba samay tak sun rahe hon, tab bhi main kaafi pareshaan ho jaata hoon."
44,So both really causing say that's really troubling if you're suffering,routine,16_44,T,yq,,So dono hi kehte hain ki yeh really pareshani wala hai agar tumhe takleef ho rahi hai.
45,Yes.,routine,16_45,P,ack,,Haan.
46,"All right. What I'm going to do is because I'm going to schedule you to come and see a counselor here, okay? pi b, maybe later this week. Okay, that'd be okay. That'll work. So I'll take you out to the front. We'll get you scheduled will be treated later on this week. ",story,16_46,T,ci,,"Theek hai. Kya mai karne wala hoon ki mai tumhe yaha ek counselor se milne ke liye schedule karunga, thik hai? Pi b, shayad is hafte ke baad. Thik hai, wo sahi rahega. Hum aage dekh lenge. Hum tumhe schedul kar lenge aur aap is hafte ke baad ilaaj ho jaoge."
47,"Okay, great. ",inactive,16_47,P,ack,,"ठीक है,"
48,What you told me it's been very helpful. I want to thank you for coming in.,inactive,16_48,T,gt,,"Tune jo tumne mujhe bataya hai, bahut hi madadgar tha. Main tumhe aane ke liye dhanyavaad dena chahta hu."
49,Thank you.,inactive,16_49,P,gt,,"""Dhanyavaad."""
