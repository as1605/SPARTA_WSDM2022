And but automatic, I mean that they occur relatively automatically, they just sort of pop into your mind, and you don't stop to check them out. Okay, and we all have these kinds of automatic thoughts. You don't have them, everybody I know has them their inner thoughts. In fact, if you think about it for a minute, we probably have a lot more thoughts. We don't speak out loud, that are part of our inner dialogue and thoughts, we actually end up speaking aloud other people. Mm hmm.

Theek hai, sabko aise hi hoti hain ye automatic thoughts. Agar aapke paas na ho unse toh, sabko hai ye unke andar wale thoughts. Haan, agar aap sochte hain thodi si der ke liye, toh shayad humaare dimaag mei bahut saare thoughts hote hain, hum jo bolte nahi hain, woh humaare andar ki baat hai. Aur humare dimaag ki baate hum actually doosro ko bolte hain. Mm hmm. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki aapke paas bhi bahut saare aise thoughts honge, aur aap kuch unka udaharan de sakte hain.

And so if you're thinking like this, it makes sense that you'd be feeling pretty nervous inside and you might have some of these physical reactions. Mm hmm. So let's put those in here. This is the emotion sparks They are much shaky. You said? Yeah. Quite a fear. Yeah. If we're going to write that fear on a zero to 100, scale and zeros, none at all and 100 is the maximum anyone could ever get. Where would you be at this point?",routine,102_26,T,ack,,"Accha. Fir phir hum ek aur box rakhenge. Ye ek event ka koyi kotton ki tarah hai. Ye event aapko aise sochne par majboor kar sakta hai jo aapko anxious feeling uttha sakta hai.

To chalo yeh emotions ko yahan pe daalte hain. Ye hai wo emotions jisse kuch shaky ho jaate hain. Aapne kaha tha? Haan. Kaafi darr hai. Haan. Agar hum zero se lekar 100 mein likhein jahan zeroes koi bhi nahi aur 100 sabse zyada ho sakta hai. To aap is point pe kahan par honge?"

Putting a box we're gonna call behavior. This is how you actually acted when you're in the situation. So what did you do? If you had these thoughts and you had these feelings,",routine,102_30,T,id,,"Saans lo. Koi lobster digest kar lo. Toh yeah. Bohot kuch chal raha hai yahaan pe. Haan. Aur kaafi emotional strain hai.

To iss case mein, woh pharmacy gayi hai. Ussi saal, shayad steering wheels mein damage nahi hai. Haan. Haan, mujhe ummeed hai ki nahi hai."

I would call my husband and keh deti ki tum apne raste mein usse le lena, get karlo."
36,"an escape route, if you would?  So usually you would avoid this if we looked at this as a model. For many of these situations about driving and feeling, yes, the usual behavior would be to try to get out of it or avoid it. Okay? And so if you do avoid it, then what happens?",routine,102_36,T,irq,,"Ek escape route, agar aap chahen toh? Toh madhyamik roop se, aap yeh avoid karte hain agar hum isse ek model ke roop mein dekhte hain. Kai baar chalane aur mehsoos karne ke baare mein, haan, aam taur par aap isse nikalne ki ya usse bachne ki koshish karte hain. Thik hai? Aur agar aap usse avoid karte hain, toh phir kya hota hai?"

40,"You don't have to worry about it. So that's what happens for a single episode of this anxiety. I'm wondering though, if we look at the the impact on you of avoiding and getting relief, overall, as far as managing driving, what do you think it does there?",routine,102_40,T,id,,"Tension hone ki tension mat lo, isliye hota hai yeh single episode anxiety. Socho toh, agar hum tumhari driving ko handle karne mein bachi huee aur aaram milne se dekhen, toh overall, tum par iska kya asar hai?"

42,"it. Okay. So in a way, it decreases your confidence over time. I think so. Yeah. I think suspect that that not doing it repeatedly gives you this belief about your capacity to do these driving things. And what's that belief? Yeah,",routine,102_42,T,irq,,"Haan. Thik hai. Toh ek tarah se, yeh aapki aatma-vishvaas ko dheere-dheere kam kar deta hai. Mujhe lagta hai. Haan. Mujhe shak hai ki is baat ko baar-baar nahi karne se aapko yeh vishwaas ho jaata hai ki aap driving karne ki yeh kshamta rakhte hain. Aur yeh vishwaas kya hai? Haan."

We call them automatic thoughts, and then they influence your emotions. He's feelings you have and then that influences how you handle the situation. Mm hmm. Okay. Now let's think together for a moment before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this. So let's take a look at these thoughts. Do you know anybody else that drives regularly that might think differently than you? Yeah, okay. I mean, an example.",routine,102_44,T,id,,"Mai nahi kar sakta. Toh yeh vaapas aata hai is vichar par ki mai nahi kar sakta. Haan aur woh bhi nahi kar sakta. Tum nahi karte ho. Theek hai. Toh yahan par yeh ghatnaon ka ek dora hai, ye sankramak vichaar ko trigger karte hain. Hum unhe automatic vichaar kehte hain, aur phir woh aapke emotions ko prabhavit karte hain. Unke bhavnaayein hain jo aapke jaise evam situation ko handle karne mein influence karte hain. Mm hmm. Theek hai. Ab chalo hum ek lamhe ke liye yeh sochte hain ki hum kaise aage badh sakte hain aur tumhe iss mein madad de sakte hain. Isliye chalo hum in vichaaron par nazar daalte hain. Kya tumhe kisi aur ko pata hai jo regular tours par jaata ho aur tumse alag tarah sochta ho? Haan, theek hai. Ek udaharan."

Lekin meri behen ko gaadi chalane ka bahut shauk hai. Haan, main matlab ye h bhi hai ke woh har mauke ko haath se nahi jane deti hai."
46,"So for some reason, we don't know exactly why. But the key thing here is not looking at why but to help you with actually making change in this. But you do have some differences in the way you think about driving. That might be something that we could begin to work on in our session, we might, for example, check it out, what's the chances of someone slamming into you? Okay, what's the chances of you being stranded out there on highway and even if you were stranded, is there a way you could cope with that or manage that you can get back home? So these are some things that we can begin to do. So I'm going to mark here, we could work on these thoughts, okay. And then by working on the thoughts, we might be able to help you reduce the emotions, but there are also some things that I might be able to teach you that you could use to reduce this level of distress that you have that Would be nice to be able to calm yourself down in situations. So we'll have some, try to build some skills to manage your emotions. And then on this behavior side, one thing that we might begin to work on is helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving things so that you can build your confidence back up. And again, build your skills to do it. And I can see that that causes a little bit of edginess here, what would you think?

Lekin tumhari driving ke baare mein sochna ka tarika mein thoda sa alag hai. Shayad humari session mein hum uspe kaam kar sakte hain, hum aise mein kisi tumhare se takraar ka chance hai? Thik hai, tumhari jagah khadi ho jane ka kitni sambhavna hai aur agar tum wahin atke hue bhi hote ho, kya tum usse samna kar sakte ho ya uske saamne ho sakte ho? Yeh kuchh kaam hai jo hum shuru kar sakte hain. Main yahan par mark kar raha hoon, hum aapke yeh vichaar par kaam kar sakte hain. Aur phir hum aapke vichaaron par kaam karke, aapke emotions ko kam karne mein sahayta kar sakte hain. Lekin mujhe kuchh cheezein sikha sakti hain jo tum istemal kar sakte ho ki yeh dukh kam ho sake. Aapne apne aap ko shaant karne ke liye kuchh kirdaar banane ki koshish karenge.

I certainly wouldn't want to make it worse. Okay, but it cause you too much anxiety. Uh huh. And what we'll try to do is pace it adjust to the level that's right for you. Okay, so that you can make some progress and get to the place you want to be, which is to be able to drive to your new office, cross a bridge, and maybe even, you know, drive those couple hours to visit your son.

51,summary,"The patient feels anxious for instance when they had to go to drug store to buy medicines for their daughter. The patient experiences anxiety, fear and almost feels like having panic attack. The patient enacts the previous scenario and fears what if they get stranded, lost the way back home or end up at that road forever. These cause high levels of distress for the patient. The patient agrees if they stop driving, their confidence levels will drop so that is not the solution. The therapist mentions these are automatic thoughts, and suggests to work on developing few skills to overcome the fearful thoughts. The therapist envisions the patient will be able to drive to their new office, cross a bridge or drive a couple hours to meet their son. The patient feels very nice about it. ",,,,,
