I keep some alcohol by my bed because it's hard when I wake up in the morning, like, it's just really difficult to like, get out of bed without having a drink. So I'll drink some then.

Is waqt ka kya hai ya phir sab kuch ho chuka hai, mujhe pata nahi."
52,So couple times you indicated that you're indifferent toward it. And why I'm curious about that is because that's not been the way You've appeared before you appeared before to be unhappy that you were you were drinking. And now you're more or less something that you don't have strong feelings about one way or the other.,routine,144_52,T,gc,0.0,Toh kai baar tune bataya ki tu iske prati uthavla nahi hai. Aur mujhe iss baare mein usi baat ka chaska lagta hai kyoki pehle toh tu dukhi dikhaai diya karta tha jab tune daaru pee raha tha.

58,"So feeling guilty about drinking, That's what's caused you problems.",routine,144_58,T,crq,0.0,"So feeling guilty about drinking, Ye hi tera mushkilon ka karan hai."
59,"That I mean, I don't know if that's what's causing me problems. But at this point, it just seems pointless to keep making myself feel guilty about it as what I'm saying.",routine,144_59,P,cd,-3.0,Main yehi keh raha hu ki mujhe yeh pata nahi ke yeh mere liye mushkil ki wajah hai ya nahi. Par ab aisa lagta hai ke yeh bekar hai ki main apne aap ko chhoti si baat ke liye doshmani mehsus karun.

Like, what is the point of this life where I have no job, and I'm gonna lose my house? And you know, I just don't get it. Like, why do you want me to keep feeling guilty about my drinking when everything else is not working? It's not working. And so I'm just supposed to like keep trying. I don't get that anymore. I don't get it.",story,144_61,P,id,-3.0,"Mai nahi chahta, mai khush hona chahta hu. Mai badhkau nahi peena chahta, mai ek acchi zindagi chahta hu. Par iss waqt, bas mujhe pata nahi, kyu mai uske bare mein guilty feel karu? Kya hai iska maksad? Jaise, meri zindagi mein koi naukri nahi hai, aur mai apna ghar bhi kho dunga? Aur pata nahi kyu, mujhe is sab se samajh nahi aata. Kyu chahte ho ki mai apne peene ke liye guilty feel karta rahu jabki baaki sab kuch nahi kaam kar raha hai? Yeh nahi kaam kar raha hai. Isliye bas maine constant try karna chahiye. Mujhe ab samajh nahi aata. Mujhe yeh samajh nahi aata."

63,"Yeah, I mean, yeah. As it is like, this just doesn't make any sense to me. Like why should I keep fighting to be sober. If I can't, you know, I lost my job. It's too late for that. Like, the whole point of coming to you is to, you know, have a better life things are getting worse. I'm not saying it's your fault. I'm just saying like, what's the point of this?

As it's like, yeh mere liye bilkul bhi sense nahi karti. Aakhir main kyu musko-khush rehne ke liye ladai karta rahun. Aur agar main nahi kar sakta toh, samjho, maine apna naukri bhi kho diya hai. Bahut der ho gayi hai. Puri planning tumse milne ki toh yehi thi ki, tum sab teekh kar do, lekin abhi toh har cheez bigdh rahi hai. Main tumhari galti keh nahi raha. Bas yeh batao, iska kya matlab hai? Agar haalat nahi sudhrenge aur yeh itni zyada kharab ho rahi hai, ki ek baar bhi main daru nahi nahi pi raha ho toh mushkil ho rahi hai."
