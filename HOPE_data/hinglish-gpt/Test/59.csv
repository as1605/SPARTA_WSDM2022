0,"So Tommy I wanted to talk to because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party and you know, you're such a good kid, like, I don't know what you're doing drinking. It's not good and it will ruin your life",symp/reasoning,59_0,T,irq,,"Tommy yaar, main tere sath baat karna chahta tha kyunki maine Facebook pe kal dekha ki kuch tasveerein hai jo mujhe tere aur tere kuch doston ke hawale se thoda chinta janak lag rahi hai ek party mein aur tu kya jaane, tu bahut accha ladka hai, mujhe nahi pata ki tu sharab kyun pee raha hai. Ye theek nahi hai aur ye teri zindagi ko barbaad kar dega."
1,I mean it was just the like a social gathering it wasn't like I was looking for it the drinks were there and I all my friends were doing it and it was just it's it's not something that I like do okay on occasion but whenever the opportunity presents itself it it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes,symp/reasoning,59_1,P,irq,,"Mujhe yaad hai woh bas ek social gathering thi, yeh bilkul waisa nahi tha ki main uske peeche tha, drinks wahan par thi aur meri saari dost usse kar rahe the. Yeh jaise itna hi hai ki main kabhi kabhi karta hu, lekin jab bhi mauka milta hai toh thoda masti karne ka mauka milta hai."
2,"I Tommy there's so many consequences with drinking you know you're not even 21 yet you could get arrested you could you know have a drunk driving accident you could you know, mess up your schoolwork you have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really really concerns me.",routine,59_2,T,gc,,"Mai Tommy, there's bahut consequences with drinking you know you're not even 21 abhi tak you could get arrested you could you know have a drunk driving accident you could you know, kharaab your schoolwork, you have such a bright future ahead of you. It just really really concerns me."
3,"I get what you're coming from but I I really did. I thought that I had it under control. And I didn't let myself get too far gone. I didn't want to be in how do I put this little Like, I want it to be in control. And I wanted to make sure that all my friends were Okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much.",routine,59_3,P,gc,,Mai samajh gaya tu kahan se aa raha hai par maine sach mein. Socha tha ki main us par qaboo rakhta hoon. Aur maine apne aap ko zyada door nahin jaane dia. Mujhe aisa nahi tha ki main kaise yahan payi jaun. Main sab pe control mein hona chahta tha. Aur mujhe apne doston ko bhi theek hone ka dhyan rakhna tha. Isliye maine khud ko zyada sharab na peenay dia.
4,"There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're under age is drinking too much. You know, like, think about it. Think about all the things that can happen to you.",story,59_4,T,gc,,"There really isn't something like not consuming excessive amount of drinks. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're below legal age is drinking excessively. Soch lo, soch lo ki tumhare saath kitne baatein ho sakti hai."
5,"Yeah, I understand exactly what you're saying. And",routine,59_5,P,ack,,"Haan, main samajh raha hoon ki tum kya keh rahe ho. Aur"
6,how much are you drinking?,routine,59_6,T,irq,,/*
7,"I don't think I'm drinking that much. I mean, it's, it's mainly for social gatherings. Like it's nothing that I do, like by myself or whatever. It's just the",routine,59_7,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta nahi ki main itna pi rahi hoon. Mera matlab hai, yeh zyada tar social meetings ke liye hai. Jaise ki main isey akele ya khud se nahi karti. Yeh bus yun hi hai."
8,"it's like, every weekend.",routine,59_8,T,crq,,"Yeh jaise hi, har hafta."
9,"every other weekend, I would say,",symp/reasoning,59_9,P,cd,,"har hafte ke dusre din, main keheti thi,"
10,"Tommy, I'm just so concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do?",routine,59_10,T,irq,,"Tommy, mai to bas itna chinta kar raha hu, pata hai na, kya tum kuch behtar karne ki koshish nahi kar sakte?"
11,"I guess I can, I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you're coming from.",routine,59_11,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta hai main kar sakta hoon, shayad main apni school ki kaam-bhar se adhik productive ho sakti hoon aur jyada parties attend karne ki bajay. Aur main samajh sakta hoon ki tum kya kehna chahte ho."
12,"Yeah, are your friends the problem? Like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with?",routine,59_12,T,irq,,"Haan, kya teri doston mein hi samasya hai? Shayad tu sirf apne youth group mein jo bachchon ke saath jyada samay bita raha hai, un bachchon ke saath nahi rehna chahiye jo tum party kar rahe ho?"
13,"Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself, I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can.",routine,59_13,P,ack,,"Yeah, main samajhta hoon ki maine khud par yeh nahi lagaya hai, main samajhta hoon ki inki taraf se yeh zabardasti ho raha hai. Aur main bas unki footsteps mein chal raha hoon kyunki lagta hai ki jo wo kar rahe hain bahut mazedaar hai. Aur main bus yeh dekhna chahta hoon ki main apne high school ke anubhav ko poora kar saku."
14,"Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.",routine,59_14,T,gc,,"Haan, moment mein bahot saari cheezein aisi hain jo fun lagti hain par humein pata hai ki woh theek chunav nahi hain, na? Yeh wahi kuch cheezein hain jinko hum hamesha discuss karte hain, apne zindagi ke liye acche chunter karne ke baare mein aur apne liye jo sabse behtar hai wohi karna. Aur main bas yahi kehna chahta hoon, pata nahi tumhe sochna chahiye badi tarah se yahan par kuch badlaav karne ki."
15,"Yeah, I, I do see that. Maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I It does make a lot of sense. And I, I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking. ",routine,59_15,P,ack,,"Haan, main bhi dekhta hoon. Shayad thoda kam peena meri zindagi ko kafi had tak behtar kar sakta hai aur ismein bahut zyada sense hai. Aur main sochta hoon ki main thoda zyada koshish kar sakta hoon sharab ki matra ko kam karne ki taraf."
16,I think you really need to quit.,routine,59_16,T,orq,,Mujhe lagta hai ki tumhe sachmuch chhod dena chahiye.
17,"Yeah, I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I, I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.",routine,59_17,P,ack,,"Haan, main toh bol raha hu ki daaru hamari society mein bohot common hai aur har jagah jaha bhi main jata hu, parties aur aisi cheezo mein hai. Mujhe lagta hai mujhe isse adjust kar lena chahiye ya kam se kam uske asar ko samajhna chahiye that I let it completely bahar jaane se pehle. Main usee tarah ise dekhta bhi nahi jaise meri life ko poori tarah se barbaad kar dega."
18,"Think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, I wish you would quit. If all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. It's really important. Yeah,",routine,59_18,T,irq,,"Socho tum galat ho. Pata hai, mujhe sachmuch chinta ho rahi hai. Uss par, main chahta hoon ki tum chhod do. Agar tum sirf kami zaroorat ko kam karne waley ho toh woh kuch hai, kuch nahi hai. Pata hai, main tumhari is baare mein baat karne ke liye aapka aabhari hoon lekin main aapke saath iske baare mein baat karti rahungi. Yeh sachmuch zaruri hai. Haan,"
19,"I, I just I don't see the problem in it right now. And maybe it's because I haven't really had that dramatic of an experience. But,",routine,59_19,P,id,,"Main, main main mujhe isme koi samasya nahi dikh rahi hai abhi. Aur shayad isliye kyunki mujhe abhi tak itni badi ghatna nahi hui hai. Lekin,"
20,"um, do you want to wait for that to happen? Do you want to wait for a dramatic experience?",routine,59_20,T,irq,,"Um, kya aap uski hone ki pratiksha karna chahte hain? Kya aap ek jhaaki lene ki pratiksha karna chahte hain?"
21,"You're right. I don't want I don't want to be too far gone. Before it's too late. Like I, I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I I guess I've never really had any, any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much, or affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think.",story,59_21,P,id,,"Tum sahi ho. Main nahi chahta ki main bahut door jao. Pehle hi der na ho jaye. Jaise main, main khayal kar sakta hoon ki kuch ho sakta hai jahaan mujhe nikalna mumkin na ho. Aur main sochta hoon ki main is par poora control rakhta hoon, par sach mein, shayad mere paas utna control na ho jitna main sochta hoon."
22,"All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get to trial here and stop drinking.",routine,59_22,T,gc,,"Thik hai. Achha, shayad yeh koi cheez hai jise hum saath mein kaam par laga sakte hain. Aur, pata hai, mujhe lagta hai hume ek aisa plan banaana chahiye jo tere liye kaam karega taaki tu yahan par trial par pahunch sake aur peena bandh kar sake."
23,"Yeah, I think that that would be a good step forward into an A life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol.",routine,59_23,P,gc,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki yeh ek accha kadam hoga aage badhne ke liye, jisme shaayad main sharab se chhutkara paakar zindagi ki asli sachchaiyo ko anubhav kar sakun. Kyunki sharab ke nashe ki jagah hamare paas ek sachchi zindagi hai."
