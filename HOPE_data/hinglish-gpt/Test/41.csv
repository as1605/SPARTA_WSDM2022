17,"Right. Right. And, I mean, I was looking for a program that would stimulate her, you know, that would that she really enjoy going to, but, I mean, they were either like babysitting programs or they were just participants were all at like, different developmental levels so that she couldn't really she could make friends.",story,41_17,P,ack,,"Theek hai. Theek hai. Aur, main mera matlab hai, main ek aisa program dhoond rahi thi jo uski utsukta ko badhaye, tumhe pata hai, jo ki usko sach mein jaane jaane ka maza dilaye, par, main matlab ye hai ki, ya to vo bachchon ka dekh-rekh karne waale program the ya phir sab hi shaayad alag-alag vikaas star par the, jiski vajah se vo sach mein apne doston ko bana nahi sakti thi."
18,"Yeah, they were they were not not good for her.",story,41_18,P,id,,"Haan, woh woh uske liye na na theek nahi they."

20,"no, she did not she. She just there just wasn't that that sense of like, that common commonality, you know, just there was no, no basis for like friendships there were there were there were some young people there who are like screaming, yelling and who are talking to them. And she didn't know how to engage. ",story,41_20,P,cd,,"Nahi, woh nahi thi. Woh bas waha thi, waha pe koi vishesh chakkar nahi tha, aap jaante hai, waha dosti ke liye koi adhar nahi tha, waha kuch young log the jo chillate the, chilaate the aur unke saath baat karte the. Aur woh nahi jaanti thi ki woh kaise interact kar sakti thi."
21,And so so just there wasn't when when you visited they didn't sort of the program didn't help you to connect cert help your daughter to connect to anything that was going on that you were just sort of viewing it.,routine,41_21,T,gc,,"Aur aise toh jab aap gaye the tab kuch bhi nahi hua tha, aapke beti ko koi madad nahi mili, aapko dekhna tha bas."

And once I did, it was just so disappointing.",,41_22,P,gc,,"Theek to Nikaalo, I mean, Maine ek poore din me se har ek program ko observe kiya Ok, jiska bahut time lag gya Haan haan, I mean, tumhe pata haina, main full time kaam kar raha hun aur main, time schedule karna itna mushkil tha, in jagahon par jaane ke liye. Aur jab finally maine kiya, toh bahut hi disappoint hone wala tha."
23,summary,"The patient is frustrated that they are not able to find a suitable program for their daughter. The patient requests the therapist to try out a program, but the therapist's schedule is filled for two weeks. The patient's daughter had tried three programs and none of them worked since she couldn't really connect with the rest of the participants. There is no commonality for the basis of building friendship. The patient had observed a whole day of program and was very disappointed. ",,,,,
