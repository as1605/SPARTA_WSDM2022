0,"Okay, a great job on your homework was really excellent. He listened to the imaginal exposure recording about six times. And you did the exposure, the in vivo exposure of walking around and touching things like doorknobs and other surfaces and objects you normally wouldn't touch both at your house and other places you went, and you sat down on the floor, and you even ate lunch off the floor at your house and at your mom's house. Okay, and no washing, no wash, no, no hand washing, no extra washing. Perfect. Good for you. Okay, so what did you learn from all that? Do you think over the course of the time you've done that?",story,100_0,T,id,,"Okay, tera homework bahut hi badiya tarike se ho gaya hai. Tumne hamare homework ke liye bahut accha kaam kiya hai. Tumne exposure ke recording ko kareeb 6 baar suna hai. Aur tumne exposure kiya, in vivo exposure ke roop mein, ghumte hue aur chizon ko chhu ke bhooke rakha jo aam taur par nahi chhu sakte apne ghar aur dusre jagahon par bhi. Aur tumne zameen par baith kar khana bhi khaya, apne ghar aur apni maa ke ghar par. Okay, aur kuch nahin, koi washing, kuch nahin, haath dhona bhi nahi. Perfect. Tumhare liye bahut accha hai. Okay, to tumne kya sikha iss sabse? Kya tum iss douran thoda sikh gaye ho?"
1,It just got easier. At the beginning. It was really hard. And I feel like my stats were much higher than the end. So I guess that was what we talked about the,routine,100_1,P,id,,Ab itna bhi asaan ho gaya. Shuruwat pe. Bahut mushkil tha. Aur mujhe lagta hai meri stats khatam hone se pehle zyada high thi. Toh shayad wahi baat thi jo humne baat ki thi.
2,"habituation, habituation, right? Yeah. The fact that when you do something like that, that initially makes you anxious, and you do it repeatedly, especially in for prolonged periods of time. Your anxiety comes down, right? We're just not built to stay in definitely anxious. Okay. You notice any other changes or anything else?",symp/reasoning,100_2,T,yq,,"Haanji, haanji, theek hai na? Haan. Jab aap aise kuch karte hai, jo aapse pehle ek aadarsh answe banaya tha, aur aap use baar baar karte hai, khaaskar seemit samay ke liye. Aapka anxiety kam hojata hai, na? Hum hamesha anxious hokar thodi der hi nahi reh paate. Theek hai. Kya aapko koi aur fark ya koi aur cheez dikh rahi hai?"
3,"I noticed that before doing the exposures, I was really, really anxious. And then it kind of went down, like the anticipatory anxiety that we also discussed.",symp/reasoning,100_3,P,id,,"Mai ne yeh note kiyah ki exposures karne se pehle, mai bilkul bohat anxiety hay. Uske baad thodi kam ho gayi, jaise humne bhi discuss kiya tha, wo anticipation ki anxiety."
4,Right. Did that change by so yesterday?,routine,100_4,T,yq,,Haan. Kya woh kal ke piche se badal gaya tha?
5,Yeah.,routine,100_5,P,op,,Haan.
6,"So you're saying you're not only notice that it went down during the exposure, but you started feeling less anxious even approaching instead? Good? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. All right. Good. Okay. All right. So you're doing so well. We're going to take another step up the hierarchy today like we planned, right. Okay. So this is the dog leash day. You bring it? Yeah. Okay, good. All right. We'll get to that later in the session. First, we're going to do some imaginal exposure. Okay? And you remember what the purpose of that is? Why Why are we going to do imaginal exposure?",routine,100_6,T,irq,,"Toh tum bol rahe ho ke tum sirf note kiya ki exposure ke samay down hua, par tumhe anxiety mein kamjor feel hone laga approach karne ke bajaye? Teek hai? Haan, perfect. Theek hai. Chal thik hai. Teek hai. Haan. Aise accha kar rahe ho. Hum aaj jaise hamne planned kiya tha, hum harek hierarchy mein upar ek aur kadam uthayenge. Teek hai. Toh yeh hai kutta leash day. Tum laoge na? Haan. Teek hai. Theek hai. Hum baad mein session mein baat karenge. Pehle hum kuch imaginal exposure karenge. Teek hai? Aur tumhe yaad hai iska purpose kya hai? Kyun hum imaginal exposure karenge?"
7,That way I can kind of relive a story or a situation that would make me really anxious and eventually deal with the fear consequence of getting sick in my case,routine,100_7,P,id,,"Aise main woh ek kahani ya ghatna ko yaad kar sakta hun jiski wajah se mujhe kaafi ghabrahat hoti hai aur phir mujhe darr ka samna karna parta hai, khas kar agar mere liye beemar hone ka khatra ho."
8,"right. So the idea is, this is how we are able to have you have exposure to or sort of a confrontation in imagination with the consequences you fear of touching things that are contaminated and not washing, doing your rituals. Right. Okay, perfect. So did you write the story? ",routine,100_8,T,irq,,"Sahi hai. Soch yeh hai, ki hum yahan tak pahunche ki apko ya to hamare saamne apne sambandh ko matlab se dhote hue ya nahi dhote hue apne dushprabhav se jude vishwasghaatan ke saath apne dushprabhav ko samjhaane ke liye. Sahi. Thik. Toh kya apne kahani likhi?"
9,I would say like a 70.,routine,100_9,P,id,,Mai ek 70 ke jaise kahunga.
10,Okay. All right. Go ahead and start when you're ready. Should we press play? Thank you for reminding me to start the recording. So you have that for homework. Okay.,routine,100_10,T,id,,Thik hai. All right. Chalo jaari rakho aur jab taiyar ho tab shuru karo. Kya hum play dabaye? Shukriya mujhe yaad dilaane ke liye ki recording shuru karoon. Toh tumhe ghar ka kaam rahta hai. Thik hai.
11,"So I'm in my house and the dog starts barking, and I know that that means that I have to take him out. I really don't want to so I'm thinking maybe I should wait until Joe gets home and he can do it. But I know the dog keeps barking, he's gonna wake up the baby. So I decided to go to the front door and get a leash. I'm not going to wear the gloves they usually wear so I feel we experienced touching the leash. But I'm already feeling really anxious. And I look at the leash and I see that it's gross and full of hair and the dog has been biting on it and in probably has saliva and other things and I see stains and Miss test thinking or if that's dog poop and I get sick and I just feel myself shaking and really sweaty. And my heart is beating really fast. So I'm feeling really, really anxious but I push myself and I grab leash, and I get the dog, open the door, go out and grab the leash.",story,100_11,P,id,,"Toh main apne ghar mein hoon aur kutta bhonkna shuru kar deta hai, aur main jaanta hoon ki iska matlab hai ki mujhe use bahar le jaana hai. Main sachmuch nahi chahta ki ye kaam karoon isliye main soch raha tha ki shayad main intezaar kar loon jab tak Joe ghar na aaye aur wo ye kaam kar sake. Lekin main jaanta hoon ki agar kutta bhonkta raha, to wo bachche ko jagayega. Isliye maine faisla kiya ki main front door par jaao aur ek leash le loon. Main gloves nahi pehnoonga jo usually pehente hain taaki main uss leash se touch kar sakoon. Lekin main pehle se hi bohot anxious mehsoos kar raha hoon. Aur main ne leash ko dekha to pata chala ki wo bheegi hui hai aur poore baal bhar poore khokhle se hain aur kutta ne uss par kaata bhi hai aur shayad usmein thook bhi hai aur dusri cheezein bhi hain aur main ne daag bhi dekhe aur Miss test soch raha hoon ki agar wo kutte ki gandagi toh main bimar ho jaaoonga aur main ne khud ko thar-thari uthate huye aur bohot pasina bhari hota dekha. Aur meri dil ki dhadkan bohot tez ho jaati hai. Isliye main bohot hi anxious mehsoos kar raha hoon lekin apne aap ko dabake main ne leash pakdi aur kutte ko pakda, darwaaza khol ke bahar nikla aur leash pakad ke."

14,"Okay, you're doing great, just keep going.",routine,100_14,T,id,,"Okay, tum kar rahe ho bhaut accha, bas jaari rakhna."
15,"So I grab the leash, and the dog is pulling and I feel the lease kind of pushing through my skin and I'm thinking all the bacteria that's getting there and I'm going to get sick, wanna vomit, but I just keep going. So I walk the dog, come back home, and I just leave the leash in the front door. And I'm thinking, I'm probably going to get sick. I really want to wash my hands. I really want to take a shower. But I try not to and I stopped myself. And I'm feeling really, really anxious. So I can't stop thinking about washing. So I tried to go to bed. Decided to fall asleep.

So I go to the bathroom, start vomiting. And I know I'm sick. I already got something I should have washed. I started thinking about that. Going to get the baby sick.

16,"Okay, great job. What's your level now?",symp/reasoning,100_16,T,irq,,"Thik hai, bahut accha kaam kiya. Tumhara level abhi kya hai?"
17,Like 80. Okay.,symp/reasoning,100_17,P,id,,80 जैसा। ठी
18,"All right. So just keep visualizing this. I'm going to describe it now. And you just stay with that image as much as you can. So you're in the house and the baby's sleeping and you're trying to get some housework done and do things for dinner. Suddenly, you hear the dog at the front door barking and barking and immediately your heart rate kind of jumps up and you get upset and anxious because you know, that means He needs to go out. And Joe is not going to be home for hours. And you really don't want to take him out. But you have to. And it makes you sick and tired and upset, because you're not going to use the gloves that you always use when you have to take them out. So you walk toward the door, and you think, well, maybe I'll just make them wait. But you realize how wake the baby up if you don't take. So you go toward the leash, and it just makes you even more anxious to see it. And it's dirty. And it's chewed up, and it's gross, and you see stains on it. And you think about what those are from and maybe they're from dog poop and that's going to get on you. And you pick it up anyway and snap it on his collar. And as you go out the door and he lunges outside, he pulls that leash into your hand and you feel the contamination from the leash, entering your body, through the pores of your skin and you feel like it's just running up your arm through your bloodstream. And you keep thinking oh my god, what if I get sick from this What if What if there's some germs in this or bacteria, but you keep walking him until he finishes what he has to do and bring him back inside the house. Take the leash off. And the urge to wash is so powerful, so strong, you want to go scrub your hands and get in the shower and wash your whole body and do it quickly and get all these terms off from the leash. But you don't do that. You know, to make yourself not do the ritual. And then you go back in then just keep doing the housework and keep doing things but that's the sense of feeling sick, is staying with you and worrying about what's going to happen if you picked up germs from the leash. At night you go to sleep, still anxious, still upset about what happened. Wake up in the morning. And then before you have your eyes open even a couple minutes you know that you're sick, you can feel your body being sick, you rush to the bathroom and vomit You can feel the fever and the time your body is just not not right. You're sick. And you know, it's because you handled that lesion didn't wash, you didn't do the washing you needed to do. And now you're sick and the baby will probably get sick. And if only you had done the washing, okay? What's your level now?",story,100_18,T,id,,"Thik hai. To ab bas isko visualizing rakho. Main ab isko describe kar raha hoon. Aur tum us image ke saath jitna ho sake utna rehna. To tum ghar mein ho aur baccha so raha hai aur tum kuch ghar ka kaam karne ki koshish kar rahe ho aur khana banane ke liye kuch kaam kar rahe ho. Achanak, tum sunte ho ki deewar ke samne barking kar raha hai, aur turant hi tumhara dil ka dhadkan badh jaata hai aur tum chid chaad ke aur chinta mein aa jaate ho kyunki tum jaante ho ki ab uska bahar jaana zaroori hai. Aur Joe bahut der tak ghar par nahi aayega. Aur tum sach mein use bahar nahi le jana chahte ho. Lekin tumhe karna hi padta hai. Aur tum iske liye thakan aur chid chaad se pareshaan ho, kyunki tum use bahar jaane ke liye aksar use kiye jaane waale gloves nahi istemaal karne wale ho. Is liye tum darwaaze ki taraf jaate ho aur sochte ho ki shayad tum bas use thoda intezaar kar lo. Lekin tumhe pata hai ki agar tum use bahar na le jaao to baccha uth jayega. Is liye tum lesh ki taraf badhte ho aur sochte ho ki shayad tum use bas intezaar kar sakte ho. Lekin tumhe chordhna bhi padata hai kyunki tum jante ho ki agar tum use chordhoge to uski khaasi dikh jayegi. Aur is ke saath saath tumhe gandgi bhi dikh rahi hai, aur woh saaf bhi nahi hai aur kai tore se toota hua hai aur tumhe stains dikh rahe hai us par. Aur tum sochte ho ki woh kuchh shayad kutte ke maal se bhi honge aur woh tum par aa jayega. Lekin tum use utha kar uske collar par bandh kar dete ho. Aur jab tum darwaaze se bahar nikalte ho to tumhe woh lesh tanau ki tarah pakadta hai aur tum mehsoos karte ho ki woh gandgi tumhare sharer mein pravesh kar rahi hai, tumhari skin ke pores se aur tumhe laga raha hai ki woh tumhare haath se upar tezi se tumhare bloodstream mein jaata hai. Aur tumhe yehi soch par lagi hai ki agar tujhe isse koi bimari ho gayi to? Agar isme kisi kitane ya bacteria hain to? Lekin tum use aage bhi leash ke sath chalate ho jab tak ki woh apna kaam khatam nahi karta aur phir use ghar mein wapas le aate ho. Leash ko utarte ho aur fir bas sarir dhona ka man karta hai, itna adhik shaktishaali abhi trem sitting strong hai ki tumhaari hath dhona jaana chahte hai aur fir jaldi se shower mein ja kar pura sarir dhulna chahte ho aur leash se jo bhi gandgi hai use dhona chahte ho. Lekin tum aisa nahi karte. Tum hamesha ki tarah ritual nahin karne ka faisla karte ho. Aur phir tum dobara ghar mein jate ho aur wapis acchha kaam karne lagte ho, lekin tum tab bhi ulti pan ki tarah bimar mehsoos karte ho, aur yeh chinta tumhare saath rahti hai ki agar tumne leash se koi bimari le li hai to future mein kya hoga? Raat ko sone jaate ho to bhi chid chaad mehsoos kar rahe ho, chinta mein rehte ho ki kya hoga. Subha jaago toh do pankho ke liye hi, pata chalta hai ki tum bimar ho, tumhe apne baccho ko bimar hone ki puri tarah mehsoos ho raha hai, tum jaldi bawaseer karne lagte ho bathroom ki taraf jaldi jaate ho aur isase pet ko ulti ki tarah bn"
