0,"So, alright, let's take a step back and talk about competency. What education Did you need for the job you have now?",routine,23_0,T,irq,,"Toh, thik hai, ek kadam peeche chalte hain aur kshamata ke baare mein baat karte hain. Job ke liye aapko kon kon se padhai ki aavashyakta thi jo ab aapke paas hai?"
1,I have my bachelor's degree. And we got a little bit of training. You know every so often we get some training at work and stuff like that.,routine,23_1,P,id,,"Mere paas apni bachelor's degree hai. Aur hume thoda sa training mili hai. Pata hai, kaam par hum kabhi kabhi training lete hain aur aise hi kuch cheezein hoti hain."
2,Are you evaluated at work by anybody to see if you're in a job you should be?,routine,23_2,T,yq,,क्या कोई आपकी नौकरी पर मूल्यांकन करता है कि क्या आप उस नौकरी में हैं जो आपको हो
3,"Yeah, I have a supervisor so they check up on stuff and also like if I feel like I have questions and stuff like that, I can go to them as well.",routine,23_3,P,op,,"Haan, mere paas ek supervisor hai toh woh cheezon par nazar rakhte hain aur agar mujhe sawal hain ya koi baat hai toh main unke paas ja sakti hoon."
4,Have you been Found in that system to be somebody who's satisfying the requirements of in terms of competency satisfy the requirements of employee.,routine,23_4,T,yq,,Kya aap us system mein paye gaye hai jo kisi vyakti ki competency aur karyakshamta ko pura karne mein saksham hai?
5,"Yeah, I mean, I haven't been fired. So that's a good sign again,",routine,23_5,P,op,1.0,"Haan, main toh keh raha hun, mujhe abhi tak nikala nahi gaya hai. Toh yeh phir se ek achhi khabar hai."
6,"that's a good sign. Yeah, you haven't been fired. Have you ever had any type of write up or somebody discussing something with you?",routine,23_6,T,yq,,"woh ek acha indication hai. Yeah, tumhe kisi ne nahi nikala hai. Kya tumhe kabhi kisi parkar ka likhit prasang ya kisi ne tumse koi baat ki hai?"
7,"No, I just I kind of feel like maybe the climate has changed a little bit at the office after this happened, like maybe other people think I didn't make the right decision. I guess maybe that's part of where all my doubts are coming from, like, no one has said to me and I have, you know, my supervisor hasn't called me in and said, I'm concerned about this, but I just feel like maybe  other people think that I did something wrong.",symp/reasoning,23_7,P,on,,"Nahi, mujhe lagta hai ki shayad office mein ye ho gaya hai ki iss baat ke baad mahaul mein thoda badlav aaya hai, jaise shayad kuch log mere faisle se khush nahi hain. Main sochti hu ki mere doubt sab is hi wajah se hai, koi mere paas aake mujhe nahi bola hai aur mera supervisor to mujhe andar nahi bula kar ye nahi bola hai ki unhe is baare mein chinta hai, lekin mujhe lagta hai ki shayad kuch log mere faisle par galat soch rahe hain."
8,"Alright, so there's no there's no evidence supporting that. In a kind of a direct fashion, like a supervisor coming to, but there's no other evidence supporting it based on your, what you're feeling, how you're perceiving things. Yeah, you're getting this feeling that, by the way, they're interacting with you.",routine,23_8,T,crq,,"Okay, so ab thik hai, waha koi saboot nahi hai jo yeh saboot kare ki usse support hota hai. Thoda seedhe tarike se, jaise oversteer ke, lekin tere, jo tu feel kar raha hai, tere perception ke hisab se, koi aur saboot bhi nahi hai. Haan, tu ye mehsoos kar raha hai ki tujhse kaise baat kar rahe hain, by the way."
9,"Yeah. Which, I guess maybe I shouldn't be that freaked out about because there have been other people who have made mistakes and like, the supervisors have talked to them and, you know, even then they didn't lose their jobs. So it's not like, you know, I, you know, I don't know, I guess it's not like just hearing them, or thinking that they're judging me is an indication that something terrible is going to happen or that I made this huge mistake.",story,23_9,P,id,,"Yeah. Jaise ki mujhe lagta hai shayad mujhe itna ghabraana chahiye nahi kyunki yahan pe aur bhi logon ne galtiyaan ki hain aur unke saath supervisorsne baat ki hai, aur pata nahi, shayad unki naukri jaane ko nahi hui hai. To koi bada ni hai ki main unko sunke, ya sochte hue ki wo mujhe judge kar rahe hain, ki humein kuch bura hone wala hai ya maine ek badi galti ki hai."
10,"Alright, so you can see that I'm talking this through you can see that. So some of this could be feelings. Thoughts you're having, combined with what you're actually observing share, you're filtering your observations in a way that's maybe making them seem a little more destructive, or more negative.",routine,23_10,T,id,,"Thik hai, toh tu dekh sakta hai ki main tere saath baat kar raha hoon. Toh yeh feel kuch ho sakte hain. Tere vichar hai, jo tere observations ke saath jude hue hain, jinhein tu ek tarah se filter kar raha hai, shayad unhein thoda destructive ya negative dikha raha hai."
11,"Yeah, it's kind of like, I know, it's not that big of a deal because, like I said, My supervisor hasn't talked to me and it's not like I've heard anything terrible about anything happening to the kids or anything like that. But I just feel like, you know, I have those thoughts like, oh, was she you know, saying something? You know, when she said that? Did she was she referring to what happened? and stuff like that?",story,23_11,P,id,,"Haan, yeh thoda sa, mujhe pata hai, yeh bohot bada mamla nahi hai kyuki, jaise maine kaha, mere supervisor ne mujhse baat nahi ki aur bacchon ke saath koi buri baat sunne ko nahi mili. Lekin mujhe bas aisa lagta hai, tumhe pata hai, mere dimaag mein woh khayal aate hain ki, oh, kya woh kuch keh rahi thi? Jab woh yeh keh rahi thi? Kya usne jo hua uss se relate kar rahi thi? Aur aise hi cheezein?"
12,Can you can you provide an example of an interaction with a coworker where where they said something that you thought maybe was referring back to this?,routine,23_12,T,irq,,"Kya aap muje ek coworker ke saath ek interaction ka example de sakte hai, jisme unhone kuch kaha tha jo shayad aap isse refer kar rahe the?"
13,"Yeah. So like we were having like our regular work week. And we kind of like, you know, discuss how things are going. And it's been kind of a big deal what, you know, more so than usual that the kids were removed from this family. So, you know, one of my co workers kind of nudged me and said, like, oh, you're the bulldozer you, you know, you plowed right through that family took those kids away. And, you know, I think she meant it kind of, like as a joke and just, you know, maybe to say, like, you know, you did what you needed to do, but it kind of made me feel like does she think that I'm just callous? Like, does she think that I just didn't care and you get what I'm saying?",story,23_13,P,id,-2.0,"Haan. Toh jaise hum normal kaam ka hafta bitarahe the. Aur hum aise thora discuss karte the ki chal kya ja raha hai. Aur iss baar bohot hi badi baat hai, ki tumhare liye baccho ko is family se hataya gaya. Toh, tumhari ek dusre kaam wali ne mujhe elbow kiya aur boli, ki oh, tum bulldozer ho, tumne us family ke paas kiya, baccho ko lekar gaya. Aur main sochri thi ki shayad wo mazak me boli thi aur bas, tum tumhare kaam ko pura kardo, par mujhe thora is baare me sochne par majboor kar diya ki kya wo sochti hai ki main biddi hun? Kya wo sochti hai ki mujhe koi fark nahi padta aur tumhe pata hai main kya bolri hun?"
14,"So she referred to as a bulldozer. And one way to take that would be powerful, efficient. Another way to take that would be kind of destructive we talked about before destructive powers. They're mechanical they don't have a lot of feeling.",routine,23_14,T,id,,"Toh woh ek bulldozer ki tarah refer ki gayi. Aur iska matlab ho sakta hai shaktishali aur prabhavshali. Dusra tarika ye ho sakta hai ki ye thoda tabahi faila deta hai, humne pehle destructive powers ke baare mein baat ki thi. Yeh mechanical hote hain aur unmein bahut kam ehsaas hota hai."
15,Yeah.,inactive,23_15,P,ack,,Haan.
16,So you don't know exactly know how she meant it but you're thinking maybe it was negative,routine,23_16,T,id,,"So tune ko exactly pata nahi hai ki woh iska matlab kya tha, lekin tu soch raha hai ki shayad woh negative tha."
17,"yeah. And I guess it kind of like goes back to like my fear that I didn't think it through that I kind of just, you know, I made the report and that was that and, you know, it makes me feel like Was I being mechanical? Was I just was I just nonchalant about it? Should I have put more thought into it? And it really, you know, it hit me where it hurt I guess you know.",routine,23_17,P,id,-1.0,"Haan. Aur main toh sochta hoon, jaise ki yeh mere darr se bhi jude huye hai ki maine usse bina soche samajh ke hi bana liya tha, kya main khokhla tha? Kya main bas apni chinta se bahar nikla tha? Kya maine iss par zyada soch nahin daala tha? Aur sach mein, yeh mujhe lagta hai ki yeh mere liye kaafi dardnaak tha."
18,So her saying that really kind of brought up this thought that maybe you are maybe you are not empathetic enough or compassionate enough.,routine,23_18,T,crq,,तो उसका यह कहना कि वास्तव में उस विचार को उठाया है कि शायद आप रहमदिल या सहानुभूति करने के लिए काफी कामयाब नहीं
19,"Or even just thoughtful. I guess maybe I was just being, you know, just going about my job without putting a lot of thought into What I was doing exactly.",routine,23_19,P,cd,-2.0,"Ya fir soch-vichar se bhara hua. Shayad main bas aise hi tha, aap jaante hain, apni naukri karne ke liye bina kisi vichar-vimarsh ke."
20,"So, maybe one thing you would have done differently in light of that comment. At the time making a decision, you would have thought through the steps more.",routine,23_20,T,id,,"Toh shayad ek cheez tumne uss comment ke prakash mein alag tarike se kiya hota. Decision lene ka samay par, tumne kadam soch samajhkar liye hote."
21,"Yeah, maybe taking a little bit more time.",routine,23_21,P,ack,,"Haan, shayad thoda sa adhik samay le lena."
