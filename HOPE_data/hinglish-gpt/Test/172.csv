And I ever since then it's just like, I don't really feel like doing much. I just kind of feel like what's the point and let my husband take care of a lot of stuff. You know, I used to, you know, shop for the groceries all the time and make sure the house is always stocked and make dinner every night and get the kids ready for school in the morning and I still do that stuff. But a lot of times, you know, I let it slide. Sometimes I won't make dinner or whatever. And when I do do it, I just feel like I'm forcing myself to do it.

Aur tab se main bas aisa lagta hai ki kaam karne ki koi zaroorat nahi hai aur main apne pati se bahut kuch sambhalne deti hoon. Kyunki main pehle humesha sabziyon ke liye kuchh kharidti thi aur ghar hamesha dharaasht tha aur har raat dinner banati thi aur bachchon ko subah school ke liye tayyar karti thi aur ab bhi main yeh sab karte hoon. Lekin bahut baar main isse chod deti hoon.

Because I know people always say you're, you know, you're feeling unfulfilled, like you should go back to work, but it's not it. You know, I've felt happy with it for so long.

So I guess like, it's not super recent, but recently he, I finally have no children in the home. So it's more, it's more time to myself. And I kind of fill that gap a little bit with other things. Like I did Cub Scouts with the boys for a while. And like I said, I had some friends around the neighborhood so that kind of like, fill that time. But now that stuff, it's just not really happening anymore. So now I kind of feel like it's not it's not boredom, you know, it's not like I don't have enough to do. It's like, I don't want to do anything. But then at the same time, I feel frustrated because there's nothing to do.",symp/reasoning,172_9,P,ack,-1.0,"Haan, bilkul.

Aur mai kuchh cheezon ke saath is gap ko thora bhar raha hu. Jaise mai pehle boys ke saath Cub Scouts kiya karta tha. Aur jaise ki meine kaha, hum around neighbourhood kuch dost hai, toh woh thora is waqt ko bhar dete hai. Lekin ab woh sab hona chhor diya hai, aisa kaee mosam se.

But this is something else this is more consuming. It's, you know, like the difficulty of him going away to school, almost was motivating, like it was hard, but at the same time, it was freeing because I had other opportunities to do stuff.

Par yeh kuch aur hai, yeh zyada zeher bhar raha hai. Yeh hai hi nahi, yeh kuchh aur hai jo mujhe rok raha hai. Shayad iska kaaran yeh hai ki jab mere chhote bete ko school jaana tha, toh mere liye motivation ban raha tha, mushkil tha lekin usi waqt, yeh mujhe azaad kar raha tha kyunki maine doosre mauke paaye the kuch kaam karne ke liye.

I would just like, you know, I would wake up and, and I would be like, Okay, it's time to get up and niklo from bed and get tayyar to go. I mean, you know, sometimes if, if, if I was thoda sa tired, it would be thoda sa harder. You know, it's not, you know, as a stay at home mom, I usually get enough neend for the most part now that the kids are older and everything, so it's not usually too hard to get up and main, I would, I would, you know, it would be a good aur din, you know, I would be khush to get up and take care of the things that I zaroorat thi to take care of and I felt accomplished."
52,"So maybe what's going on here? Or maybe maybe we could help you remember, you know, over the last few sessions, we've talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and different techniques that I'll be using and different things we're talking about, sometimes with behavior, the behavior that's useful, which in this case, I'm assuming we can agree is the getting up on time. behavior that's useful has to come first, even if the feeling doesn't match. Right. So sleeping those extra I presume you a couple hours delays you from feeling sad, but it causes other problems. If you were to get up one time, you might still feel sad, right? Because that's why you're over sleeping, as you're sleeping longer to avoid that. But the functional part of being a housewife, as you identify would be completed. So maybe some of those feelings of sadness and guilt would over time abate. Because functionally speaking, you're completing the tasks that you want. What's tough about that, So in the moment, it's easy for me to say this now. But in the moment, like for instance, when you have to get out of bed tomorrow, you're going to be facing that same challenge, which is I can get up now and feel depressed, or I can wait and feel depressed later. So in that moment, it's hard to act on the behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards. I mean, it sounds like you want to get up and ",routine,172_52,T,gc,0.0,"Kya ho raha hai yahaan pe?
