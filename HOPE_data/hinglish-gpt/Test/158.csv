So staying low, and close on course, for first I know she's coming up to my final exams, and a lot of us as a few exams. And so I just started working really hard. I felt like right now is the real time to put the effort in and to put the work in. So I started to step a bit later and take on a bit more work. So my stress levels sort of start to increase over a while. I was drinking a lot more coffee took few caffeine tablets and energy drinks. A few people were because some of the environment at the time was a lot of people were pushing themselves that they wouldn't normally do and some people were taking Ritalin.",symp/reasoning,158_7,P,cd,0.0,"Haan, toh woh chaar saal pehle tha. Toh haan, yeh thoda disappointing tha, saari cheezein dobara se karne ke liye. Lekin yeh university ke kareeb shuru hua tha. Iss wajah se main low raha tha, apne course mein focused tha, kyun ki main jaanti thi ki meri final exams paas aa rahi hai, aur kuch exams bhi the. Isliye maine shuru se kaam bahut zyada karna shuru kar diya. Mujhe lagta tha abhi hai waqt apne efforts aur kaam mein daalne ka. Iss wajah se main thoda der tak kaam karne lagi aur zyada kaam bhi liya. Isse meri stress level thode badhne lage the. Main pehle se zyada coffee pi rahi thi aur kuch caffeine tablets aur energy drinks bhi le rahi thi. Kuch log waise bhi, kyunki environment ka pressure tha, jo log normally nahi karte the, ab unse bhi ho raha tha aur kuch log Ritalin le rahe the."

Saare cheezein jo ho rahi thi, main bahut zyaada productive aur capable ho raha tha, kaam zyada kar raha tha, meri dimaag zyada tez kaam kar raha tha. Aur is tarah se mera hosla, us period ke dauran, baar baar badh raha tha. Haan, aur is tarah se main khoob jee bharke kaam kar raha tha."
14,"so did that mean to you then to be at that time it sounds like you put quite a lot of pressure on yourself you've been doing really well at uni and and you know, this was it This was the time. What did it mean to be feeling like that kind of more awake and more energized maybe?",routine,158_14,T,gc,0.0,"Toh kya yeh tumhare liye tab ho gaya tha ki tum khud par kaafi dabao dal rahe the?

I didn't really talk to any of my friends about it. But then I yeah, I started to just sort of grow into it. And I took the opportunity to Yeah, enjoy this time and it's so it didn't really reach its peak until after my exams I was still. I was still functioning throughout my exams, and I have since found out that I didn't get the results that I wanted to.",story,158_15,P,gc,0.0,"हाँ, वह तो मुझे था। यह मेरा तरह का समय था। इसलिए मैं ने तीन साल बिताए, मुझे लगा कि मैं नियंत्रण में था और अच्छा काम कर रहा था। मैं उस समय असली तौर पर अपने जीवन का हिस्सा नहीं था। मैं अपने किसी भी दोस्त से इस बारे में बात नहीं करता था। लेकिन फिर मैं उसके अंदर भले ही बढ़ता गया। और मैंने मौका पकड़ा और इस समय का आनंद लिया। और इसलिए जब तक मेरी परीक्षाएं खत्म नहीं हो जातीं, यह शरीर हमेशा से फिर से सक्रिय रहता था। और मुझे बाद में पता चला कि मैंने अपने अपेक्षित परिणाम नहीं प्राप्त किए थे।"
16,and what you might think that was?,routine,158_16,T,orq,0.0,Aur tum soch rahe ho ki yeh kya tha?
17,"Well, I thought that I was working harder than ever, but it was misjudged, I think and so I, I didn't perform to the best of my ability in when it came to the to the exams, and so I didn't achieve.

Main nahi mila pahli baar mein aur sirf ek baar pahuncha."
18,"what else was happening for you around that time? I mean, you talked about the pressure of your exams and staying up for them was anything else going on? And the same time",routine,158_18,T,irq,0.0,"What aur ho raha tha aapke liye us samay? Mera matlab hai, aapne exams ke pressure ke baare mein baat ki thi aur unke liye jagrana karna koi aur cheez thi? Aur wahi samay mein?"
19,"well, so to the end of the end of university, and that was the time where all as soon as that period stopped of work then I was sort of let off the leash a bit. And yeah, I just thought to grow even further. So I mentioned I was I was taking Ritalin to block coffee and as soon as our exams had stopped, I just substance abuse of took a bit more of a hold. And yeah, I just sort of grew into this person who I thought was him was the guy that everyone wanted to be around and to see and so I made sure that I was just everywhere that could be seen I was.",story,158_19,P,id,0.0,"Ab toh university ka ant tak, aur woh tha woh waqt jahan par kaam rookne ke baad mujhe thoda azad chhoda gaya. Aur haan, maine socha ki aur bhi zyada badhu. Maine bataya tha ki main Ritalin le raha tha coffee ko rokne ke liye aur jaise he hamare exams khatam hue, maine substance abuse ko zyada pakad liya. Aur haan, main bas iss insaan mein badh gaya jiske hisaab se main wo aadmi tha jisko sab ko pasand tha aur dekhna chahte the aur iss liye maine apne aap ko sab jagah dikhne wala bana diya."
20,"This is like there they got after you finish the exams but before the results are out,",routine,158_20,T,gc,0.0,"Yeh to hai ki jab tum exams khatam karoge to wo tumhare peeche pade rahenge lekin results aane se pehle,"

26,How's that affect you?,routine,158_26,T,irq,0.0,"""Tumhe uska kya asar padta hai?"""
27,"I honestly was on cloud nine at the time. And yeah, I was just always the person ever wanted. Everyone wanted to know. In my head. I was like, I put myself at the center of the universe and I even I convinced a friend of mine who develops apps that we should if I had an idea to develop an app about when you go into a alcohol shop that it all the way up put out what's the most cost effective way to get wasted? ",story,158_27,P,id,0.0,"Mere ko honestly pata tha ki time pe main cloud nine pe tha. Aur haan, main hamesha se hi wo insan tha jo sab chahte the. Sabko pata lagana chahte the.

28,Right.,inactive,158_28,T,gc,0.0,Theek hai
29,"So yeah, I mean, I, at the time I was spending a lot of money, a lot of my parents savings, I got a credit card, which I didn't tell them about. And so in this sort of role as the man as the man about town I was spent a lot on Yeah, I'll hold drugs close invested in this technology and I was",story,158_29,P,id,0.0,"Haan, main toh yeh keh raha tha ki main, tab main bahut paisa kharch kar raha tha, mere ma aur baap ke bachat se, mujhe credit card mil gaya, par maine unko yeh nahi bataya. Aur is tarah se main shehar ke mardon jaise apni hawas mein, kaafi kuch kharch kiya main, drugs ke upar bhi, iss technology mein bhi maine invest kiya tha aur main yeh kaam kar raha tha."
30,so it sounds like it began with kind of the exam pressure and putting more pressure on yourself to stay up using kind of stimulants keep yourself awake. And then you started to feel like you were more and more the man you were you were kind of popular you were successful. How did you respond to and cope with those symptoms? What did you do once those are kind of begun?,story,158_30,T,gc,0.0,"Toh yeh toh shuru hui jaise ki exam pressure ke saath aur apne aap par zyada dabao daalne ke saath, jaise dawao ka istemaal kar ke aap apne aap ko jagaaye rakhte the. Phir aapne mehsoos kiya ki aap zyada popular aur kaamyaab ho rahe the. Aap uss samaadhan ko kaise nibhaaye? Jab woh shuru ho gaye the, toh aapne kya kiya?"
31,"Well, having not had to deal with my illness throughout University and for it not being a part of that world, I I didn't confront those symptoms in a in a way that's gonna have long term stability. And as well, it began with doing the work that I needed to do. That's just, that's just what I needed to do in order to achieve my goals and to achieve what I want to. And then it just, I just let it take hold. And I it was all part of it wasn't it wasn't Yeah, it wasn't the illness It was me it was just I was in, I was the master of this whole situation and I was everything that was happening was down to my own doing.",story,158_31,P,id,0.0,"Achha, meri beemari mein dhali hui university ke dauran aur us duniya ka ek hissa na hone ke kaaran, maine us me sawaalo ka saamna nahi karna pada. Aur saath hi saath, jab maine apne lakshya haasil karne aur voh jo chahti thi, usse haasil karne ke liye kaam shuru kiya. Bus, uske baad, maine isse apni zimmedari liya aur phir voh mere zindagi mein gehra pan hone lagi. Yeh sab meri beemari nahi thi, main apne kaaran sab kuchh sochti thi, aur main hi thi jo sabse bada vichitra tha."
32,"So it sounds is on the one hand, you didn't confront it, you kind of just let it roll. And on the other hand, you said that you kind of took it as evidence that you were very energetic, you were powerful. This was all kind of explained about who you were. And I guess how did that affect you looking at things in that way? ",routine,158_32,T,gc,0.0,"Toh yeh toh theek hai, tumne is se jhagada nahi kiya, bas chupchap chalne diya. Aur dusri taraf, tumne kaha ki tum isko apni taakat ka saboot mana aur yeh tumhare bare mein bata raha tha. Yeh sab batane se tumhari kya parwaah thi?"
33,"It just it was my time. It all been leading to like, this was the moment where I would sort of like, become the person that I want it to be. all the hard work, all everything while the work that my parents had done for me and all the work that I had been doing. It was now crystallizing",routine,158_33,P,id,0.0,"Yeh bas mere time tha. Sab kuch aise hi ho gaya, jaise ye mera waqt tha jahan main woh insaan banunga jo main chahta tha. Pehle bohot mehnat ki, mere maa-baap ne bhi meri liye kaam kiya aur main bhi bohot mehnat ki thi. Ab sab clear ho raha hai."
34,"for you on the brink of something, yeah, mess from the sounds of it.  And, again, going back to that kind of beginnings Ah, where you started to stay up late and use stimulants. I mean, how much sleep were you getting at the beginning?",symp/reasoning,158_34,T,gc,0.0,"Tum jo kuchh toofani ke kinaare khade ho, haan, sab kaali si lagti hai. Aur phir se, us pe wapas jaate hain, jaise shuruwaat mein Tum raat bhar jagne lag gaye aur stimulants ka istemaal shuru kiya. Mera matlab hai, tum shuruwaat mein kitna waqt soye the?"

36,and what kind of things did you notice? Did you notice any changes from having less and less sleep in your body maybe the way you were thinking.,routine,158_36,T,irq,0.0,"Aur kya cheezon ko aapne notice kiya? Kya aapne koi badlaav notice kiya kam neend hone se, shayad aapki soch mein?"
37,"Think the harder I was working, the faster my brain then will work and how much the harder I work, the more I would do. So it was it wasn't.

Yeh bas ek haan, josh mehnat ke zyada ho raha tha. Mere vichaar tezi se chal rahe the aur meri lakshya meri haan mein zyada majboot tha. Meri nishtha bhi zyada thi."
38,and how did you feel in your body? Did you notice any changes physically?,routine,158_38,T,irq,0.0,Aur tumhare shareer mein kaisa laga? Kya tumne sharirik se koi badlav mehsus kiya?

40,Okay. I wants you to kind of things were a bit further along after your exams. He said you're going out a lot you convinced your friend to do this app. Was there anything else that you did that maybe you wouldn't normally do that you think might have been assigned to you that your meat was much higher than you'd like it to be?,routine,158_40,T,gc,0.0,"Thik hai. Mujhe chaahta hai ki aap exams ke baad, cheezein thodi aur aage badhi hui ho gayi hon. Usne kaha ki aap bahot baahar ja rahe ho, aur aapne apne dost ko iss app ko karne ke liye convince kiya. Kya aapne kuch aur bhi kiya jo aap normally nahi karte, aur aapko lagta hai ki aap par assign kiya gaya tha, jiski wajah se aapka score expected se zyada tha?"
41,"There was I hide a lot of savings. That my my parents had built up for me, which I probabiliy don't really exist anymore either through the money invested, and through drugs, clothes. I had a girlfriend at the time but because it was because I was the main character, and in a sense, it always was only the only person that matters and so sort of those around me especially, still didn't really have as much importance. So on nights out, I wouldn't. She just wouldn't be in my mind and so that would be Other women.

Tab mere paas ek girlfriend thi, lekin wo meri wajah se nahi balki mere protagonist hone ki wajah se thi. Aur ek sense mein, hamesha meri siwa koi aur zaroori nahi tha, isliye meri aas paas waale bhi kuch zyada mahatv nahi rakhte the. Isliye jab raaton ko bahar jaate the, main unka dhyaan nahi rakhta tha. Aur fir dusri aurtein aati thi."

46,summary,"The patient had final exams approaching and they had to put more efforts. This increased their stress levels and they started taking Ritalin. The patient felt increased confidence, worked a lot harder and were a lot productive but they did not secure the grades they wished to. The patient was in control of themselves for three years. The patient got too involved with substance abuse like cocaine after finishing exams and before results. The patient has been using their parent's savings and got a credit card too to spend on drugs. The patient feels at the brink of succeeding from their hard work and they seem to have fallen trap to the stimulants. The patient had just been getting two to three hours of sleep. The patient has also not given importance to their girlfriend. The patient feels they were not themselves, and people closest to them have been most affected. ",,,,,
