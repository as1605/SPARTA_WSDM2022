0,How are you? Not well?,inactive,9_0,T,yk,,Kaise ho? Theek nahi ho?
1,No,inactive,9_1,P,on,,"""Nahi"""
2,what's going on.,inactive,9_2,T,irq,,What ho raha hai?
3,"Well, remember I had told you that they were downsizing at my job.",symp/reasoning,9_3,P,id,,"Achcha, yaad hai maine tujhe bataya tha ke mere naukri mein wo logon ka kam kam kar rahe hain."
4,I remember that.,symp/reasoning,9_4,T,ack,,Mujhe yaad hai.
5,"So I, you know, been there 20 years at my job. Yeah. And they're downsizing lately and they let me go.",symp/reasoning,9_5,P,id,,"Ae, tu to jaant hai na, mai, wahaan pe 20 saal se kaam kar raha tha. Haan. Aur ab wo haal mein kaam kam kar rahe hain aur unhone mujhe jaane diya."
6,That's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that.,routine,9_6,T,gt,,ये बेहद खराब है। मुझे बुरा
7,"No, no, no. So yeah, it's just, you know, they let me go. I have really nothing to go on. I don't know what to do. I've been at that. job so long. I really don't know how to do anything else. ",routine,9_7,P,gc,,"No, no, no. So yeah, it's just, you know, they allow me to leave. I have really nothing to continue. I don't know what to take action. I've been at that job for a long time. I really don't know how to do anything else."
8,You should talk about the job. You're happy there.,routine,9_8,T,irq,,Tumko naukri ke baare mein baat karni chahiye. Tum khush ho wahaan par.
9,"Yeah. I was, I thought, you know, I envision doing that job for a long time. So, you know,",routine,9_9,P,id,,"Haan. I thought, mein samajhta tha, pata hai, maine us kaam ko lambe samay tak karna chaaha. Toh, pata hai,"
10,"and that's not gonna happen. No, no. How does this affect your financial outlook like your bills and such?",routine,9_10,T,irq,,"Aur woh hoga hi nahi. Nahi, nahi. Tumhare financial outlook par yeh kaise asar karta hai jaise tumhare bills aur aise?"
11,"Oh, it's awful. I mean, we definitely my husband and I, it's really spiraled out of control. My husband and I have kind of like, joint, we pay the bills together. And so this was half of our income, and that's gone. And because it was kind of more sudden, we didn't really have time to do anything else, you know, time to prepare.",story,9_11,P,id,,"Arre yaar, yeh toh bilkul bura hai. Matlab, humare pati aur maine, yeh haalat sach mein kharab ho gayi hai. Hum dono ke paas ek-saath jod ke bills bharein huye the. Aur ab yeh adha humare income ka hissa tha, woh bhi chala gaya hai. Aur kyunki ye sab tab humare upar sar par atak gaya tha, humare paas aur kuch karne ke liye samay nahi tha, haan, taiyaari karne ke liye samay nahi tha."
12,So it definitely caught you off guard. Do you have enough income with your husband's job to cover your basic bills?,routine,9_12,T,irq,,Toh yeh pakka ki aapko surprise kiya. Kya aapke pati ke job se aapki basic bills cover ho jaati hai?
13,"were a little bit. Yeah, so far. But if I don't find the job soon, then I don't know what's gonna happen. I don't know how bad it's gonna get",routine,9_13,P,id,,"Thoda sa the. Haan, abhi tak. Lekin agar main jaldi se naukri nahi milti hai, toh mein nahi jaanti kya hoga. Mujhe nahi pata hai ki kitna bura ho sakta hai."
14,to know about how long you have for you fail to meet any financial commitments.,routine,9_14,T,irq,,जानने के लिए कि आपको कितना समय है जब आप किसी भी वित्तीय वचनों को पू
15,"My husband usually deals with the bills, so I'm not quite sure. But probably in another month or so it's going to get really bad for about a month.",routine,9_15,P,id,,"Meri pati aksar bills se deal karte hain, isliye main bilkul confirm nahi hu. Par shayad ek mahine ke baad asli haalat bohot kharab ho jayegi."
16,What thoughts have you been having?,routine,9_16,T,crq,,Tumhare dimag mein kaunse khayal chal rahe ho?
17,"All sorts. I mean, I, I've worried that, you know, like, my husband and I are arguing because we're under all this stress. I worry, we're gonna lose our house. You know, I'm worried I'm going to be homeless. You know, it's embarrassing. I don't have a job now. What if I don't find another job? You know, what are my kids gonna do? My kids are, you know, relying on us to meet their needs. Yeah, yeah. So I mean, we could be homeless. I might not ever get a job again, you know, I'm not getting any younger. So I just am afraid that I won't get another job.",routine,9_17,P,cd,,"Ekdam badhaav hai. Matlab, maine socha hai, ki, aap jaante hai, mere pati aur main jhagad rahe hai kyonki hamare upar itni zyada tanav hai. Chinta hai, hamara ghar kho denge. Preshan hoon ki main gharshok ban jaaungi. Aapko pata hai, mujhe sharm hai. Abhi mere paas naukri nahi hai. Kya hoga agar main doosri naukri nahi mil paayungi? Mere bacchon ka kya hoga? Mere bachhe hamare upar nirbhar hain unke zarooraton ko pura karne ke liye. Haan, haan. To matlab hum gharshok ban sakte hain. Shayad main dobara kabhi naukri nahi paungi, aapko pata hai, main din aur badh rahi hoon. To main bas dar chahti hoon ki mujhe dobara naukri nahi milegi."
18,"Now, you said you were laid off, right? ",routine,9_18,T,yq,,"Abhi, tune kaha ki tu layoff ho gaya tha na?"
19,Yeah.,routine,9_19,P,ack,,Haan.
20,For the position. Are you eligible for unemployment?,routine,9_20,T,orq,,The post ke liye. Kya aap anashritata ke liye layak hain?
21,I'm not sure I'm still looking into that.,routine,9_21,P,od,,मैं नहीं सुनिश्चित हूं कि मैं अभी भ
22,"Because if you I mean, I'm not a labor law expert. But I think if you're, if you're laid off, there's probably decent probability you could get on employment. How much for educational?",routine,9_22,T,crq,,"Kyon ki agar tum I mean, main ek labor law expert nahi hoon. Lekin mujhe lagta hai ki agar tum laid off hote ho, toh shayad acchi sambhavna hai ki tum employment pe ho sakte ho. Kitna leke educational ke liye?"
23,I just have my bachelor's.,routine,9_23,P,cd,,Mere paas abhi tak meri bachelor's degree hai.
24,"Well, that's, that's more than most bachelor's degree. Yeah. You just haven't had to look for a job in a long time, right here. Because I'm guessing you thought you're gonna retire.",routine,9_24,T,orq,,"Arre, vo, vo zyada hai most bachelor's degree se. Haan. Tumne bahut time se job dhundhne ki zarurat nahi padhi, yahaan par. Kyunki main yeh samajh raha hoon ki tum soch rahe the ki retire kar loge."
25,Yeah,routine,9_25,P,od,,Achha
26,"So this is upsetting for a lot of reasons. So you have The financial stressors, right? I can't be minimized. The relational stressors mentioned, it's kind of embarrassing. Yeah, that's more like an identity thing I see identify with what you did right now. You don't as much, because you're not actively working in it. Yeah. Did you ever have any co workers who voluntarily left for other jobs?",story,9_26,T,crq,,"Yaar dekho ye bahut upsetting hai for a lot of reasons. Tumhe financial stressors hai, right? So usko minimize nahi kiya ja sakta. Jo relational stressors mention kiye gaye hai, wo thoda embarrassing hai. Haan, wo zyada ek identity ki baat lagti hai jaise tumne abhi kiya hai. Tum uske saath utni relate nahi karte, kyunki tum actively usme kaam nahi kar rahe ho. Haan. Kya tumhare paas kabhi koi co workers the jo khud se hi dusre jobs ke liye chale gaye?"
27,Not that No.,routine,9_27,P,cd,,Nahin ki Nahi.
28,Not at the time you worked there.,routine,9_28,T,crq,,वहाँ काम करते वक्त नहीं। (Vaha kām
29,"Not that I was aware of that. I think maybe it maybe like one A while ago, but it was a pretty good job. So. ",routine,9_29,P,cd,,"Hinglish Translation: Main uss baat ka pata nahi tha. Mujhe lagta hai shayad usse pehle koi aur kaam tha, lekin woh kaam kaafi accha tha. Toh."
30,So a lot of people stay.,routine,9_30,T,crq,,Toh bahut saare log rehte hain.
31,Yeah.,routine,9_31,P,cd,,Haan.
32,Have you ever known anybody who worked for a similar company or in the same field? Who change jobs?,routine,9_32,T,orq,,Kya aapne kabhi kisi ko jana hai jo ek hi company mein kaam kiya ho ya usi field mein? Kya wo naukri badalte hai?
33,"Yeah, one of my friends was in a similar field and he left the job and eventually found another job. You know how long it took. It took a while. It took a while. Like, maybe like two years or so at least almost, yeah, it was a struggle for their family. So I think about that",story,9_33,P,od,,"Yeah, ek mera dost ek similar field mein tha aur usne naukri chod di aur baad mein ek aur naukri dhund hi li. Tum jaante ho kitna time lag gaya. Kaafi sa time lag gaya. Kaafi sa time lag gaya. Lagbhag do saal ya fir itne se bhi jyada, haan, unke parivar ke liye yeh mushkil tha. Isliye main uske baare mein sochta hoon."
34,would you need to replace that full income to pay your bills or part of that income?,routine,9_34,T,irq,,Kya aapko us full income ko replace karne ki zaroorat hogi apne bills pay karne ke liye ya us income ka hissa?
35,"I mean, probably part of it maybe full would be ideal because, you know, we were comfortable the way we were living so far would be ideal, but you know, we could probably survive on on part of it, it just not as well as we were living.",story,9_35,P,id,,"Maine matlab hai, shayad iska ek hissa ya poori cheez bahut achha hota, kyonki, aap jaante hain, hum asani se jee rahe the toh ab tak wohi achha hota, lekin aap jaante hain, hum shayad iska ek hissa par zinda reh sakte hain, bas woh hum asani se jee rahe the se nahi hoga."
36,"So we've talked about problem solving skills before in earlier sessions, right. So have you applied a those concepts to what's going on now.",routine,9_36,T,crq,,"Toh hum pehle seh aa rahe sessions mein problem solving skills ki baat kar chuke hain, sahi na? Toh kya aapne ab jo ho raha hai mein woh concepts apply kiye hain?"
37,"I mean, I've been trying to think of think of, you know, different opportunities that might be open to me now and you know, being able to spend more time with my kids and things like that. I've been trying to think of it other ways my situation.",routine,9_37,P,cd,,"Matlab, main to soch raha tha ki ab mere liye khulne wale alag-alag mauke hai aur mere bachcho ke saath zyada waqt bitane ka mauka hai. Main use aur tarike se soch raha tha mere haalat ka."
38,"So there's sort of an upside, and then sense the time part, at some point need to replace the income. Yeah, that's very pragmatic in the money. Have you considered that if you attempted to seek a full time job to work out, you could look at part time jobs.",routine,9_38,T,orq,,"Toh koi na koi fayda toh hai hi, aur phir samay ka dhyan rakhte huye, kuch waqt mein aapko apni aamdani badalna hoga. Haan, yeh paise mein behad pragatishil hoga. Kya aapne socha hai ki agar aap ek full time naukri dhoondhne ki koshish karte, toh aap part time naukriyon ka bhi vichaar kar sakte hai."
39,"I've thought about it, but I'm really having a hard time with it.",routine,9_39,P,od,,"मैंने इसके बारे में सोचा है, पर यह मुझे बहुत मुश्किल कर रहा"
40,"What would it What would it mean about you? What would it say about you if you had to take a part time job, so finding another full time job is so much of the loss?",routine,9_40,T,orq,,"Agar apko ek part time job lena padega, to isse apke bare mein kya matlab hoga? Agar apko ek full time job dhundhna padega to kitni badi nuksaan ho jayega?"
41,"What would it mean about me is That I think if I only had a part time jobs that I wasn't qualified, that I wasn't good enough for full time.",routine,9_41,P,od,,"Mera yeh matlab hoga ki agar mere paas sirf ek part time job hota, tab mujhe lagta hai ki main full time ke liye qualified nahi hu, ya main full time ke liye kaafi accha nahi hu."
42,So you would you would internalize that and Meaning would be that you're not as valuable.,routine,9_42,T,yq,,"Toh tum toh use apne andar samaan lo, Aur uska arth yahi hoga ki tum utna hi mahatvapoorn nahi ho."
43,Yeah.,inactive,9_43,P,ack,,Haan.
44,So it speaks to self worth.,routine,9_44,T,crq,,"So, yeh hahmarih aatmahatyaah kih bahre meh bol taih."
45,"Well, right now it's not good. Well, I mean, I've been arguing with my husband, I've been drinking a lot more, you know, the depression has come back a lot worse. So it's just starting to become the cycle where you know, drinking and getting into arguments and situations not getting better and it just keeps snowballing keeps snowballing.",symp/reasoning,9_45,P,cd,,"Abhi abhi situation bahut acchi nahi hai. Matlab, main apne pati se jhagad rahi hun, aur jyada sharab pee rahi hun, pata hai, depression bahut badh gaya hai. To ab yeh cycle shuru ho gayi hai jahan pe pina, jhagadna aur halat behtar nahi hone ka ghumfirahat jaari hai aur yeh barhte hi ja raha hai."
46,"Yeah. And these these behaviors are all things that potentially could impede your goal. So it is kind of like a self fulfilling prophecy element to this. Yeah. Do you agonize you worry, invest in these thoughts? Right? And then to temporarily take away the pain you drink? Yeah. That ends up being more dysfunction, right with a relationship with your husband. Yeah. Imagine if you're intoxicated, you're not looking for new work. Yeah. That wouldn't be ideal timing. So, in a sense, you're, you're not helping things to improve. And it all kind of starts without thinking, ",routine,9_46,T,crq,,"Haan. Aur ye ye kriyaye hae jo aapke lakshya ko rok sakte hae. Ye aap ko self fulfilling prophecy ki tarah kaam karta hae. Haan. Kya aap pareshan hote hain, ye sochne mein samay bitaate hain? Sahi hae na? Aur fir dard ko kam karne ke liye aap drink karte hain? Haan. Yeh jyada kharab harkatein hoti hain, jaise aapke pati se rishte mein. Haan. Sochiye agar aap nashe mein hote hain, to aap nayi naukri ke liye nahi dekhenge. Haan. Ye bhi sahi samay nahi hoga. To iss tarah se, aap baat ko behter karne mein madad nahi kar rahe hain. Aur sab ye sab sochke hi shuru hota hae, bina soche."
47,"but it's hard when I'm really depressed and the situation's not getting better. And I'm just home sitting about, you know, drinking, while everyone else is carrying on with their life, and I'm stuck here.",symp/reasoning,9_47,P,cd,,"Par ya sab bahut mushkil ho jaata hai jab main sach mein depressed hua aur haalaat sudhaarne wale nahi hai. Aur main bas ghar pe betha hoon, pata hai, peeta hoon, jabki sab dusre log apni zindagi ke saath aage badhte hain, aur main yahan atak gaya hoon."
48,"And that ties into that kind of worthless, type five. So you're fulfilling that role. worthless. That sounds manifesting for you. And that's one thing you can do. That's an option you can drink and you could have relational struggles. But is that really? Is that really what you want at all? Is that the most useful? ",routine,9_48,T,crq,,"Aur wo unmein se ek bhi tarika nahi hai, jis se tum yo kaam pura kar sako. lago hai, tum se us tarah ka kaam karne mein kuch faida nahi hoga. Aur wo cheese, jo tum kar sakte ho, wo bhi koi jyada kaargar option toh nahi hai."
49,"Really? No, it's not helping. ",routine,9_49,P,cd,,"Kya sach mein? Nahi, yeh madad nahi kar raha hai."
50,How do you think you could break that cycle?,routine,9_50,T,irq,,Tum kaise sochte ho ki tum uss cycle ko tod sakte ho?
51,"I've been thinking about, you know, trying to get more organized, like we talked about before with the finances and, and trying to, you know, figure out exactly how much income we need to be where we want, what to do and maybe by baby steps, so it's not like, so overwhelming for me like the thought of getting a new job and making enough money and providing for my family. And like breaking it down.",story,9_51,P,id,,"Main soch rahi thi, pata nahi, par soch rahi thi ki thoda sudhar jaun, jaise hum pehle baat kiye the financial matters ke baare mein aur, aur koshish kar rahi thi ki, pata lagau ki hume kitna income chahiye woh aise jahan hum chahte hain, kya karein aur shayad chote chote kadam uthake, taaki yeh mere liye zyada daaban na ho, jaise naya job dhundhna aur itna paisa kamana aur apne parivar ko dekhna. Aur usse baatein tod dene ka."
52,"Well, that makes sense. Yeah, so the first step would be figuring out what The minimum amount you really need, right? So you'll shoot for hire full time, but you realize that you kind of need to know what the minimum is because you know what job offer you could accept in which I want free time to decline. Right? So it makes sense. So armed with that information and you could go into the workplace, right? And it was less anxiety kind of just know this Job's gonna if I get it, that's good, right Lord, I might as well not apply to this one because it's not gonna work. So as efficient as time say, it's good. That sounds logical.",symp/reasoning,9_52,T,crq,,"Haan, yeh samajh mei aata hai. Waise, pehla kadam yeh hai ki aapko yeh sochna hai ke aapko asli mei kitna minimum amount chahiye hoga, sahi toh? Toh aap puri tarah se hire full time ke liye apply karenge, par aap ko realize ho jaata hai ki aapko pata hona chahiye wo minimum amount kya hai kyunki aapko pata hai ke aap kis job offer ko accept kar sakoge jis se aapko free time milega. Sahi hai, na? Toh yeh samajh mei aata hai. Toh uss jaankari ke saath aap workplace mei ja sakte hai, sahi hai? Aur yeh kam anxiety wala rahega ke yeh job milega hi, sahi Lord? Mujhe yeh bhi pata chal jaata hai ke main iss job ke liye apply hi na karun kyunki yeh kaam nahi hoga. Toh samay ki maamle mei bhi yeh kaafi as efficient hai, theek hai. Aisa toh logical lagta hai."
53,"I think just sometimes like the fear of the unknown, like, worry about what if this never happens for me? You know, what if I don't get a job? You know, what if we lose our house?",routine,9_53,P,cd,,"मुझे लगता है कि कभी-कभी अज्ञात का डर होता है, मानो, अगर यह मेरे लिए कभी नहीं होता है तो? तुम जानते हो, अगर मुझे नौकरी नहीं मिलती है तो? तुम जानते हो, अगर हमारा घर हमसे"
54,"That worries Yeah, no worries. nagging Yeah. Yeah. So",routine,9_54,T,gc,,"Ye chinta hai, haan, koi fikar nahi. Tang karne waali hai. Haan. Haan."
55,"I mean, worst case, if we don't get a job, I mean, probably. I don't know, like, get a smaller house, or find a way around it. I mean, she would need to have some tough times. ",routine,9_55,P,gc,,"Yaani, worst case, if hum job na mile toh, yaani, ho sakta hai. Mujhe pata nahi, jaise, chota ghar khareed lena, ya phir kuch jugaad dhund lena. Yaani, unhe kuch mushkil waqt zaroor guzarna padega."
56,"Yeah. It would be difficult, right? To be fair, right? It would be difficult, but you would adapt.",routine,9_56,T,crq,,"Haan. Ye kaafi mushkil hoga, na? Sach bolu, na? Thoda mushkil hoga, par tu adjust kar lega."
57,"Right? So like, it would be difficult but I think if I really thought about it, you know, we would probably get through it.",routine,9_57,P,cd,,"Haan? Toh jaise, mushkil toh hogi hi par mujhe lagta hai agar main sach mei uske baare mei sochu, toh pata nahi, hum shayad usse paar kar paaye."
58,"So if we pick up with that we say that's really an adaptive response when we talk about adaptive responses to automatic thoughts, right? So if you're telling yourself that you have the depression and certainly anxiety, craving to drink, you tell yourself well, the worst that could happen is I don't work the rest of my life again, acknowledging that's pretty unlikely. But the worst thing to happen is I won't work again. And I might have to adapt, I might have to have a simpler life in terms of material goods and small house, but I would survive would affect my battery that have on on your mood, or your thoughts?",routine,9_58,T,orq,,"Toh agar hum usse lete hain, toh hum kehte hain ki yeh waakyakalp ki ek pratikriya hai jab hum pratikriyon ki prati pratikriya ki baat kartey hain, sahi? Toh agar aap khud se keh rahe hain ki aap ko depression hai aur bechaini bhi, aur naashe ki aasha hai, toh aap khud se keh rahe ho ki kharab cheez na ho paga dobara mere jeevan mein kaam na ho sake, ye maante hue ki bahut mushkil hai. Lekin sabse kharab hoga ki main dobara kaam na kar paoon. Aur mujhe apne aap ko adapto karna padega, material possessions aur chote ghar ke saath ek saral zindagi honi padegi, lekin main jee jaoonga, mera battery prabhavit ho sakta hai aapke mood ya khayalaat par?"
59,"I mean, I think when I really think about it, you know, like you said, I think I'm less depressed or think that I, you know, I'm more able to cope with it. You know, knowing Okay, well, this is the worst that could happen, but maybe it's not as bad as I thought. would be embed. ",routine,9_59,P,od,,"Maine socha, jab main sach mein is par ghor karta hoon, jaise ki tumne kaha, mujhe lagta hai ki main kam udaas hoon ya sochta hoon ki main usse samna kar sakta hoon. Jaante ho, okay, yeh sabse bura ho sakta hai, lekin shayad mere vichar se kam bura hai. Yah maine jaan liya hoga."
60,"So there's a piece that comes with clarity that comes with accepting what the worst case scenario could be. Right? And probably another part of the adaptive response could be, you know, I could live to the worst case scenario. I think it's important to acknowledge that it's unlikely. that's unlikely. Right? So statistics probability is on your side here. Right? So, as you go out to the workplace and the workforce and seek employment, you'll probably have some, some interviews, we don't get a job offers, right. But eventually, if I have one where you do, yeah, right. It's, it's just math. Right? If you can accept the worst case that maybe reduce or limit that alcohol consumption, reduce that depression, anxiety.",routine,9_60,T,crq,,"Toh ussey clarity ke saath ek piece hai, jisme acceptance aata hai ki sabse bura haalat kya ho sakta hai. Sahi toh? Aur shayad yeh adaptive response ka dusra hissa bhi ho sakta hai, pata hai ki main sabse bura haalat mein zinda reh sakta hoon. Mujhe lagta hai ki yeh maanna zaruri hai ki yeh bohot kam ho sakta hai. Sahi toh? Isliye statistics aur probability aapke saath hain yahaan. Sahi toh? Toh, jab aap kaam par ya kaam ki talash mein bahar jaate hain, aapko shayad interviews milenge, koi job offer nahi milenge, sahi toh. Lekin dheere dheere agar koi job offer mil jaaye, toh wahin hoga, sahi toh. Bas maths ki baat hai. Sahi toh? Agar aap sabse bura haalat ko accept kar sakte hain toh aap shayad apni alcohol consumption kam kar sakte hain, depression aur anxiety ko kam kar sakte hain."
61,Yeah.,inactive,9_61,P,cd,,Haan.
62,"So Let's end there for today. But I want you to try for the next week. I want to try plan that adaptive response, right? Actually, there's two we're talking about right? One is you could survive the worst case scenario. And the other one is that probabilistically It won't happen. Right? So you have kind of two. Well, you do have two adaptive responses I want you to apply when those automatic thoughts come up, like, I'm never gonna work again. Okay, this is a catastrophe. So like that self talk. Yeah, apply that self talk. So identify that automatic thought, because we've talked about that skill, right? And then apply that self talk right away. All right, and let's see, you have the thought record. Right. So when that you know, when you can fill one of those out, okay, when that happens when you have that automatic thought and you apply the adaptive response, even if you can't get it completely filled out, I understand that. I know there's a lot on there. Just what you can get done on that. Anything you can do. That would be helpful. ",routine,9_62,T,crq,,"So Chalo aaj kaafi ho gaya. Lekin main chahti hoon ki tum agli hafte try karo. Main ek plan banana chahti hoon jo adapt kar sake, samjhe? Waise toh do ho rahe hain, na? Ek toh tum worst case scenario mein survive kar sakte ho. Aur dusra ye hota hai ki probabilistically ye nahi hoga. Samjhe? Toh tumhare passdo adaptive responses hain. Jab voh automatic thoughts aate hain, jaise ki main kabhi kaam nahi kar paungi. Theek hai? Yeh toh ek badi musibat hai. Isi tarah se baat karo. Haan, voh self talk apply karo. Phir uss automatic thought ko identify karo, kyunki humne iss skill ke baare mein discuss kiya tha, samjhe? Aur phir turant uss self talk ko apply karo. Theek hai, aur dekho, tumhare pass jo thought record hai. Jab tum usse bhar sakte ho, tab, theek hai, jab voh hota hai, jab tum uss thought record ko bharte ho, theek hai, jab tum uss automatic thought ko apply karke adaptive response ko apply karte ho, beshak ke tum pura record bhar na paao, main samajh sakti hoon. Mujhe pata hai ke usme bohot kuch likha hai. Bas jitna tum kar sako, utna kar lo. Voh bhi kaafi hai."
63,Okay.,inactive,9_63,P,cd,,Theek hai
64,Sound good?,inactive,9_64,T,gt,,Achha lag raha hai?
65,Yeah,inactive,9_65,P,gt,,Haan
66,So scheduled for one week. So I'll see you then we'll see how this goes to progress we can make on this on the alcohol and the depression and anxiety.,inactive,9_66,T,ci,,"Toh ek hafte ke liye schedule kiya hai. Toh main tumhe uske baad milunga aur dekhenge ki ismein ham kya progress kar sakte hain sharab, tanav aur chinta par."
67,"Okay, thanks",inactive,9_67,P,ack,,"Acha, dhanyavaad."
