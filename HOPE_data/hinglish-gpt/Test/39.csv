0,Afternoon. I'm glad you could get in today.,inactive,39_0,T,gt,,Dupahar. M glad tuh see yew on time today.
1,I'm still anxious.,symp/reasoning,39_1,P,gt,,Mai abhi bhi anxious hun.
2,"Yes, last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety, and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety. And according to my notes, you were going to look into some yoga classes. You were going to attempt to drink less coffee. You were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home, and you were going to spend more time in nature. So I'm wondering how all that went?",routine,39_2,T,irq,,"Haan, last week jab tum they aur tum mujhe bata rahe they ke tumme badi ghabrahat aa rahi thi, tab humne ek plan banaya tha teri ghabrahat ke liye. Aur mere notes ke mutabik, tum yoga classes ki talash mein they. Tum coffee kam pine ki koshish karne wale they. Tum ghar se zyada bahar jaane ki koshish karte rahenge kyunki tum ""home"" mein akela reh rahe they, aur tum ab zyada waqt prakriti mein bitane wale they. To main soch raha hun ki sab kuch kaisa gaya?"
3,"Well, I looked at the gym and there weren't really any yoga classes, so I didn't I didn't really do that. I did cut back on my coffee a little bit, but I just find that it wakes me up in the morning. So, you know, I've cut back to one cup instead of two cups. And I did take the dog for a walk. But I haven't really gotten out other than that.",symp/reasoning,39_3,P,id,,"Acha, mai gym dekha aur wahan kuch yoga classes nahi thi, toh maine use nahi kiya. Main coffee kam peeti hu, lekin mai ko subah jagate hai. Toh mai ek cup se do cup pe kam kar dia. Aur mai kutte ko walk par le gayi thi. Lekin baahar jaane ka koi mauka nahi mila mujhe."
4,"Okay, so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals. You did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes. You did cut down from two cups of coffee to one. And you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk. But it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue. Getting out more with people.",routine,39_4,T,gc,,"Theek hai, toh lagta hai ki aapne apne lakshyon ki taraf thoda saa gati ki hai. Kam se kam aapne yoga ki taraf toh dekha, chahe gym mein yoga classes na ho. Aapne do cup coffee se ek cup tak kam kar diya. Aur aapne apne kutte ke saath nature mein walk ke liye bahar nikal bhi liya. Lekin itna issue bhi tha shayad. Logon ke saath zyaada ghoomne mein?"
5,"Yeah, I don't. I don't really like to go out with people. There's usually a lot of a lot of chatter, a lot of talking and it's hard for me to be in.",story,39_5,P,gc,,"Haan, main nahin karti. Main logon ke saath bahar jaane ko pasand nahin karti. Aksar zyada baat-cheet hoti hai, zyada baten hoti hain, aur mere liye yeh mushkil hota hai ki main wahin rahoon."
6,"So it's uncomfortable for you to be To around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking, and how does that make you feel?",routine,39_6,T,irq,,"Toh tumhare liye uncomfortable hai ki tum logon ke beech rahna, jahan baat-cheet aur baatein hoti rehti hai, aur isse tumhe kaisa feel hota hai?"
7,"It just makes me feel a little bit nervous. And then when I get out there, I don't really, I don't really engage in conversation.",story,39_7,P,id,,"Ye mujhe thoda sa nervous feel karata hai. Aur jab main wahan jaata hoon, main sachmuch, main baat cheet mein shaamil nahin hota."
8,"Okay, so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious. So I'm wondering what we could do about that.",routine,39_8,T,irq,,"Thik hai, isliye mein soch raha hoon ki hum iske baare mein kya kar sakte hain, kyunki sach mai logon ke saath jaane se mujhe aur bhi zyada chinta hoti hai."
9,I'm not really sure maybe I could invite people over instead.,routine,39_9,P,id,,"Me kuchh jyada hi pakka nahi hun lekin shayad main logon ko bulata hoon, yaani ki unko bulaa sakta hoon."
10,"That would absolutely be one option. You could invite people over to your house, and then you could get to choose who you're around.",routine,39_10,T,od,,"Ye ek vikalp ho sakta hai. Tum logon ko apne ghar par bulake, tum logon ke beech mein jo bhi chaho wo tum chun sakte ho."
11,"Yeah, that's a good idea.",inactive,39_11,P,ack,,"Haan, woh ek accha vichaar hai."
12,"And in terms of the yoga, let's get back to the yoga for a minute. Tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes.",routine,39_12,T,od,,"Aur yoga ki baat karte huye, chaliye ab yoga ki taraf ek minute ke liye laut aate hain. Aur bataiye, aapne yoga classes ke liye kahan dekha?"
13,"Well, I just looked at my gym. I didn't really look anywhere else because I'm already paying To go to a gym, and I don't really want to pay extra to go somewhere else. So that's why I didn't really look anywhere else. ",story,39_13,P,id,,"Mai to sirf apne gym pe nazar daali. Main kahin aur nahi dekha kyunki mai already gym ke liye paise de raha hu, aur mujhe aur kahin janeka man nahi hai. Isiliye maine kahin aur nahi dekha."
14,"Mm hmm. And so if I were to ask you right now, how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to 10?",routine,39_14,T,irq,,Haanji aur agar main tumse abhi poochhu toh tum kitne motivated ho ek se das ke scale par ek yoga class dhoondhne ke liye?
15,Maybe about a five or six.,routine,39_15,P,id,,Shayad koi paanch ya chhe ke baare mein.
16,Okay.,inactive,39_16,T,ack,,Theek hai
17,"Um, well, I, I see all these pictures in my newsfeed about yoga and I see all these pictures and I just want to do it. So I'm interested in doing it, it's just really hard.",story,39_17,P,id,,"Arey bhai, main toh apne newsfeed mein yoga se related saare pictures dekhta hoon aur dekhte hi mujhe bhi karne ka mann karta hai. Toh maine socha ki kar hi lu, par bohot mushkil lag raha hai."
18,"So when you see the pictures on your newsfeed, it makes you excited about doing it. But when you actually go to do it, it makes it more challenging. ",routine,39_18,T,crq,,"इसलिए जब आप अपने न्यूजफ़ीड पर तस्वीरें देखते हैं, तो आपको उसको करने में उत्साहित करता है। लेकिन जब आप वास्तव में उसे करने जात"
19,"Well, I haven't done it before. So it's a little bit hard to get out there because I don't think I'm as flexible Other people?",routine,39_19,P,cd,,"Achcha, maine pahle kabhi nahi kiya hai. Isliye bahaar nikalna thoda mushkil hai kyunki mujhe lagta hai ki main dusre logon ki tarah hargiz itne nimble (chust) nahi hoon?"
20,Mm hmm. And so you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people. I'm wondering if that's what Yoga is about flexibility?,routine,39_20,T,irq,,Mm hmm. Aur aap soch rahe hain ki aap doosron ki tarah nahi hai. Kya Yoga ke baare mein flexibility hi hai?
21,"Well, I think I think that people go to become flexible. But I think that maybe some people are already just flexible.",routine,39_21,P,id,,"Well, main sochta hoon ki log flexible hone ke liye jaate hain. Lekin main sochta hoon ki shayad kuch log already flexible hote hain."
22,Mm hmm. So you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest?,routine,39_22,T,irq,,Achaa. Toh tum chintit ho ki shayad tum dusron ki tarah nahi ho sakte ho?
23,Yeah.,routine,39_23,P,ack,,Haa.
24,And you'd be a beginner?,story,39_24,T,irq,,Aur tum beginner ho?
25,"Well, I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do the poses in class. ",story,39_25,P,id,,"Well, I'm worried ki main class mein poses nahin kar paunga."
26,Okay. So what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class?,story,39_26,T,irq,,Thik hai. Toh agar tum class mein aasan nahi kar paate toh tumhe kya lagta hai hoga?
27,"Well, I feel embarrassed, I think. And then if the teacher tried to get me to do it, and everybody else would see that they're trying to get me into a pose, and I think it would be embarrassing.",story,39_27,P,id,,"Ab main sharminda hoon, mujhe aisa lagta hai. Aur agar teacher mujhe karne ko koshish kare toh, aur sab log dekhe ki woh mujhe ek pose mein laana chahte hain, toh mujhe lagta hai ki yeh sharminda karne wala hoga."
28,Okay. So you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain policies. And how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class,story,39_28,T,crq,,Thik hai. Toh tussi sharam vich aunge agar tussi kar nai sakde certain policies. Te tussi ki mehsoos karde ho agar tussi saare poses class ch karr sakde ho.
29,I think I feel really good.,story,39_29,P,cd,,Main hink this tumse bahut achcha mehsoos karta hoon.
30,And so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class?,story,39_30,T,irq,,So tum sochto ho ki kya hai jo tumhe class me sare poses karne se rok raha hai?
31,Right? I guess it's just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it.,story,39_31,P,id,,Sahi? Mujhe lagta hai ki bas yeh sharmindagi hai ki shayad main yeh nahi kar paungi.
32,What would what would cause you to not being able to do it?,story,39_32,T,irq,,Kya tumhare paas usko karne mein kisi cheez ki wajah hoti hai jo tumhe karne se rok deti hai?
33,The causes are not we're not sure. Okay.,story,39_33,P,id,,The causes aren't pata nahin hum sure hain. Theek hai.
34,"I remember when you first came in last week, you told me that when you were younger, you used to be very, very flexible. And I'm wondering, what would make that difference between then and now?",routine,39_34,T,irq,,"Maine yaad hai jab aap pehli baar pichhle hafte aaye thay, aapne mujhe bataaya ki jab aap chote the tab aap bahut, bahut lincham ho jaya karte thay. Aur mujhe soch raha hoon, us samay aur ab mein kya farq hai jo aisa ho gaya?"
35,"Well, when I was a kid, I used to just practice a stretch a lot, and now that I don't, I don't have the same flexibility. Mm hmm. So as I've gotten older, I've lost a lot of flexibility",story,39_35,P,id,,"Achha, jab mai bachcha tha, tab mai ek stretch ko bahut practice karta tha, aur ab jab mai nahi karta, tab mere paas wahi flexibility nahi hai. Mm hmm. To jaise jaise main bada hua hun, mere paas flexibility zyada nahi hai."
36,and How would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed?,routine,39_36,T,irq,,Aur agar aisa hota ki tum class mein sabhi aasano ko nahin kar paate aur sharminda ho jaate aur bas sharminda rehne dete?
37,"I mean, it would be okay. But I don't I don't like that feeling.",routine,39_37,P,id,,"Maine, it would be thik thak. Lekin mujhe woh ehsaas pasand nahi."
38,What would be the payoff? Do you think? If you put up with a little bit of embarrassment?,routine,39_38,T,irq,,Kya payoff hoga? Kya tum soch rahe ho? Agar thoda sharmnaak haalat se samaan karte ho?
39,"Well, I probably feel really good in the end.",routine,39_39,P,id,,"अच्छा, मैं निश्चित रूप से अंत में अच"
40,"You know, I can give you I've lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down. As a matter of fact, some studies show that anxiety, doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications. So I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not.",story,39_40,T,gc,,"Tum jaante ho, main tumhe bahut saari padhaiyan de sakta hun aur videos bhi dikha sakta hun jo logon ne yoga shuru kiya aur yoga ki riyaaz shuru ki aur unki chinta kaafi kam ho gayi. Sach mein kuch padhaiyan bataati hain ki chinta ko yoga se dawaon ke samaan kam kiya ja sakta hai. Isliye main yeh nahi jaanta ki kya tumhe yeh baat pata hai ya nahi."
41,"I didn't really know that. I just thought that that you'll go was For about flexibility, I didn't realize there were so many other benefits.",routine,39_41,P,on,,"मुझे वास्तव में उस बारे में पता नहीं था। मुझे बस यह सोचा था कि आप चलेंगे। लेकिन अस्वावलंबितता के बारे में, मुझे"
42,Okay. So how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to 10?,routine,39_42,T,irq,,Thik hai. Toh apke lie kya feel hoga ek se dus tak ke scale par?
43,"Well, I probably, if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious, I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine.",symp/reasoning,39_43,P,id,,"ठीक है, मैं अगर मानता हूँ कि यह मुझे कम चिंतित करने के लिए होगा, तो मुझे शायद आठ या नौ के आसपास होना चाहिए, मैं स"
44,"Good, good. That's a definite improvement. And, and you could determine after that first class, whether your anxiety levels have decreased or not. And that, would that be validation for you? Or would that be? It gives you even more motivation? If your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class?",symp/reasoning,39_44,T,irq,,"Acha, Acha. Ye to bilkul sudhaar hai. Aur, aur tum ye tay kar sakte ho pehli class ke baad, ki kya tumhare anxious levels ghate ya nahi. Aur, kya wo tumhare liye validation hoga? Ya phir aur adhik motivation milegi? Agar tumhare anxiety levels yoga class ke baad turant ghat gaye?"
45,I think that would be a lot of motivation to continue.,routine,39_45,P,id,,Main sochta hoon ki yeh bahut saari prerna hogi aage badhne ke liye.
46," Okay. So one other thing that I wanted to, to mention to you was, you said that you'd walk your dog in nature and curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature. Wow.",routine,39_46,T,gc,,"Okay. Toh ek aur cheez jo main tumhe batana chahata tha, tumne kaha ki tum apne kutte ko prakriti mein ghoomate ho aur mujhe yeh jaanana tha ki tum prakriti mein apne kutte ko kitna samay ghumaate ho. Wah."
47,It was only about 30 minutes. It was really cold and windy. So we didn't want to stay out. And by we I mean the dog and I Mm hmm.,story,39_47,P,gc,,"It was only about 30 minutes, yaar. It was really cold and windy. So hum log wanted to not stay outside jaldi. Aur jab main aur Mera kutta bole toh I said Mm hmm."
48,"And so because of it, it was cold and windy. You decided to kind of cut the walk short. Yeah. And and that's definitely understandable. I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day.",routine,39_48,T,od,,"Aur is baat ke karan, bahut thand aur tez hawa thi. Aapne socha thodi si cheezo ko cut kar dein. Haan. Aur yeh bilkul samajhne layak hai. Mujhe ye sochne par mazboor kar raha hai ki aap din mein ek ghante ke liye kutte ko ghumane ke liye kya kar sakte hain."
49,Wow. It might help if I take a jacket next time.,routine,39_49,P,gc,,Waah. Agar mujhe agli baar ek jacket le leni chahiye toh yeh sahayata kar sakti hai.
50,"Okay, so if you took a jacket in cases cold, yeah. And do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful, that you could be in that would help you even more. Enjoy it",routine,39_50,T,orq,,"'Theek hai, agar tumne thand mein ek jacket liya hai, haan. Aur kya tumhe koi aisa khaas jagah hai prakriti mein jo tumhe shanti ka anubhav karwati hai, jahan tum ho sakte ho aur tumhari madad kar sake. Iska poora anand lo.'"
51,"as long as I'm just away from road noise and traffic and then it's a lot better. Okay, and there's lots of trails around my house like that. Okay,",story,39_51,P,od,,"As long as my house is away from the road noise and traffic, things are much better. And, there are plenty of trails around my house like that.Okay,"
52,excellent. Is It's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise.,routine,39_52,T,od,,शानदार। यह बहुत ही शानदार है कि आपके घर के चारों ओर आपको उस सारी गड़बड़ से अलग भग
53,Probably.,routine,39_53,P,ack,,Shayad
54,And on a scale of one to 10 tell me what that probably means.,routine,39_54,T,irq,,Aur ek scale se 1 se 10 tak mujhe batao ki ye shayad kya hota hai.
55,It's probably attend. I can I can commit to that.,routine,39_55,P,on,,"धोरा होंर, मीठो बस गर्दै। मैं त्यस सम्म वच"
56,"Okay. All right. So it sounds like last week, you had a few problems carrying out the assignments towards decreasing your anxiety. You really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes. But you already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you so you could actually do them at home.",symp/reasoning,39_56,T,irq,,"Achha. Thik hai. To lagta hai pichhle hafte, aapko kuchh samasya thi aapke chinta kam karne ke liye kaarya ko poora karne mein. Aap ek yoga class nahi dhoondh paaye kyunki aap pehle se hi ek gym ke liye sign up kar chuke hain jahaan yoga classes nahi hain. Par aap pehle se hi meri taraf se bheje hue yoga videos ke bare mein jaante hain jinhen aap ghar par kar sakte hain."
57,"Yeah, ",inactive,39_57,P,ack,,"Haan,"
58,you how strongly do you feel about doing them at home?,routine,39_58,T,irq,,Tum ghar pe unko karne ke baare mein kitna majboot mehsoos karte ho?
59,"If I could do them at home, I would probably do them all the time. Mm hmm. I think that would be a big difference.",routine,39_59,P,id,,"अगर सब घर पर कर सकता था, तो शायद मैं हमेशा ऐसा ही करता। हाँ। मुझे लगता है कि यह एक बड़ा अंतर होता।"
60," And then there would be no embarrassment factor. If you couldn't do the poses less coffee, you've gone from two cups to one cup that's very good. And get out more with people, you've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who's going to be in your space. That's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know you have no control over who's going to be in your space. And on a scale of one to 10 you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog?",symp/reasoning,39_60,T,irq,,"Aur fir sharam ka koi sawal hi nahi hoga. Aur agar tum poses karne mein kam ho sakte ho, toh tum do cup se ek cup par aa gaye ho, bahut accha hua. Aur logo ke saath zyada waqt bita ke, tumne logo ko apne ghar bulane ka faisla kiya hai, behtar hai ki bahar jaane ki bajaye. Jab tum apne ghar mein nahi jaante ki kaun tumhari jagah par hoga, tab waha hota hai ek daravna moment. Aur tum ek se 10 tak ka scale par atleast ek ghante ko dog ke saath walking karne ke liye kharch kar sakte ho?"
61,I think it's a 10. I think I can do them on all four all four.,symp/reasoning,39_61,P,id,,Mujhe lagta hai yeh 10 hai. Main sab charon par karne ki sambhavna rakhta hun.
62,Fabulous and how do you think you feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of the course of next week? How much of a difference Do you think it would make you feel?,routine,39_62,T,irq,,"Kya baat hai! Socho agar tum apne jeevan me agle haftme in sab cheezon ko shaamil karne ka mauka paate, to tumhe mehsus kaisa hoga? Kitna fark padega tumhe laga?"
63,Perfect it maybe even make me look forward to doing these things if I were doing them on a regular basis. Mm hmm.,routine,39_63,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta h ki agar main in cheezo ko niyamit roop se kar raha hota, to mujhe unhe karne se umeed karti kar sakti hai. Mm hmm."
64,And how would it make you feel?,inactive,39_64,T,irq,,Aur yeh aapko kaisa mehsoos karayega?
65,It would make me feel really good.,inactive,39_65,P,id,,यह मुझे वाकई अच्छा महसूस कर
66,And so you'd feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would do.,inactive,39_66,T,gt,,Aur aapko phir se relaxed mehsoos hoga aur aapko aur zyaada positive mehsoos hoga aur main sochti hu aap karenge.
67,Thank you so much.,inactive,39_67,P,gt,,Dhanyavaad bahut bahut shukriya.
68,summary,"The patient feels anxious. The patient hasn't done yoga classes, cut back on coffee a bit to one cup and taken dog out for a walk. The patient does not like chattering people so find hard to go out with people. One idea discussed was to invite people over home. The patient explains they would feel embarassed if they are not able to do yoga poses. The therapist clarifies yoga reduces anxiety a lot and the patient readily agrees to it. The next idea was to use jacket and take trails around the house that are less noisy for walking the dog. The therapist suggests to do yoga poses at home and that would be no embarassment. The patient confidently agrees they can do all of them on a regular basis. ",,,,,
