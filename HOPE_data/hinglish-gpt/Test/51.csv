It's been great like I've I mean I used to have issues with mood but I don't anymore and now I just oh for at least you know, last couple days at least. Maybe about a week. I don't know I haven't been paying attention but I've thought awesome like I've gotten so much done. You know I do stuff at work. I do stuff at home. I went shopping. I am doing great with Like, well, kinda great with my interpersonal relationships like I was thinking about at work this week, I thought I was like so proud of myself I. Well, firstly, I got a promotion. And also, so I was happy with that. But then I know one of my co workers, he had his birthday. So I was like, Oh, let me do something nice for him. And I went home and I baked the cake, but it's kind of annoying, because when I got there, he got mad, which is stupid, because he said, he didn't appreciate the fact that he said over the hill, but he's like, old, so I thought it'd be funny, but it wasn't apparently. But so yeah, besides that, like, this week's been awesome. And, you know, like I said, I got my promotion and made a lot of money. Like with a nice increase, I should say. And I just, yeah, so I've been feeling awesome. Getting a lot done.",story,51_5,P,cd,,"मैं मतलब, उसके पास है लेकिन मुझे ऐसा लग रहा है कि थोड़ा अजीब है क्योंकि मैं वास्तव में अच्छा का अर्थ है। मैंा हाल में उत्सुकता थी। वास्तव में यह अच्छा रहा है। यह मुझे पसंद है। मैं मतलब हूँ कि मुझे स्वास्थ्य समस्याओं से उबरना पड़ता था, लेकिन अब नहीं हो रहा है और अब मैं केवल उस चेहरे को देख रहा हूं। शायद एक हफ्ता से लगभग। मैं ध्यान नहीं दे रहा था, लेकिन मुझे ख्याल आया कि मैं काफी खूबसूरत हूं। मैं अपने काम पर कुछ काम करता हूं। मैं घर पर काम करता हूं। मैं खरीदारी करता हूं। मैं मेरे बहुमूल्य साथियों के साथ बहुत अच्छा कर रहा हूं, जैसा मैं काम पर इस सप्ताह के बारे में सोच रहा था, मैंने सोचा कि खुश हूं मैं। सबसे पहली बात, मैंने बढ़ोतरी प्राप्त कर ली। फिर भी मेरे समानोक्ता ने अपने जन्मदिन का अवसर मनाया और मैं सोचा कि मुझे कुछ अच्छा करना चाहिए। मैंने घर जाकर केक पकाया, लेकिन तब अपूर्वता हो गयी, क्योकि जब मैं पहुंचा तो वह नाराज हो गया, जो बेवकूफ है, क्योंकि उसने कहा कि उसे पर्वतटन पसंद नहीं है, लेकिन वह बूढ़ा है, इसलिए मुझे मज़ा आने लगा, लेकिन प्रतीत नहीं होता था। लेकिन हां, उसको समझ था कि इस सप्ताह सौभाग्यशाली लगा हुआ था। और, जैसा कि मैंने कहा, मुझे बढ़ोतरी हुई और बहुत सारे पैसे कमाए। और मुझे पता है कि मुझे अधिक देना महें अच्छा लगता है। मैं बस, हां, इसलिए मैं मेरी"

7,"So there's a couple projects at work that I've been working on. I got all those done. And I at home I have been working on my, like unpacking because I moved in kind of a while ago, but I have still had boxes sitting around and stuff. So I got that all taken care of.

8,So your mood is moods up. They your brother specifically had concerns about spending money.,routine,51_8,T,crq,,Tumhari mood hai moods up. Tumhare bhai ko khass taur par paise kharch karne se fikar thi.
9,"I mean, he's worried because I went on a shopping spree so he doesn't really know how much I am making with this new promotion and I don't really want to tell him I might I might actually because I'm proud of myself like I deserve it and I you know, we're still hard for so long in this company. And so with the shopping spree was kind of like treating myself. And so I've gone I went out and I did spend a lot of money. I actually maxed out one of my credit cards, but I don't have a lot of bills right now. Like I paid off all my debts, and I finished paying off my student loans too, so I could pay for it. So that's why he's worried. And like, I called him because I ran out of space in my car, and I was going to try to put this table that was gonna buy on top of my car bins and have like one of those things to attach it. So it didn't work out. And so I think you kind of got worried because he thought I was buying too much, but I returned that item because obviously I couldn't fit in my car and he couldn't come help me. So besides I've been fine.",story,51_9,P,cd,,"Yaar, uska tension hai kyunki maine ek shopping spree pe jaane ke baad unko pata nahi hai ki main is nayi promotion ki wajah se kitna kama rahi hu aur mujhe sach mein bataane ka bhi mann nahi hai, par shayad main bata du kyunki main apne aap pe garv karta hu aur mujhe yeh deserve karta hu aur jante ho, humne is company mein itni mehnat ki hai. Aur shopping spree se maine khud ko thoda pamper kiya hai. Aur maine bahut saare paise kharch kiye hai. Main actually apni ek credit card ki limit tak kharch kar chuka hu, par mere paas abhi kharch karne ke liye bahut kam bills hai. Jaise maine apne sabhi karz chuka diye aur apne student loans bhi pure kar diye hai, isliye main uske liye khud se pay kar sakti hu. Isliye uska tension hai. Aur mujhe usne phone kiya kyunki mujhe apne car me jagah nahi thi aur main yeh soch raha tha ki main apne car ke upar se table rakhkar le aaunga aur uske liye koi attachment bhi lagaunga. Lekin yeh kaam nahi hua. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki usko thodi tension ho gayi kyunki shayad usko lag raha tha ki main bahut saari cheezein kharid raha hu, lekin maine woh item return kar diya kyunki obviously woh meri car me nahi fit ho pa raha tha aur usko meri madad bhi nahi kar sakte the. Toh waise bhi main thik hu."

11,"No, not at all. I mean, like I said, I got approached at work. My bosses are extremely happy with how productive I've been how much I'm getting done. The quality of my work, I'm able to like, look over the reports and everything I turn in several times before I do it, and I always make sure I do. So.",story,51_11,P,id,,"Na, bilkul nahi. Matlab jaise maine kaha, mujhe kaam mein approach kiya gaya. Mere bosses ko kaafi khushi hai meri productivity se aur meri kaam kaafi ho raha hai.

It's actually been a good thing.",story,51_13,P,id,,"Haan aur nahi. Matlab haan, kyunki main hamesha ki tarah jyada nahin so rahi thi. Main sochna hai ki main pehle bahut zyada soti thi.

I feel like in the past I might have but I, I haven't been",routine,51_27,P,cd,,"Nahi, bilkul nahi. Ishaara karna chahti hun ki kuch nahi. Ishaara karna chahti hun, obviously apne TV par ya doston aur parivaron ke bare mein maut ke baare mein sunte honge, lekin main usmein zyada derr tak na tikti hun.
