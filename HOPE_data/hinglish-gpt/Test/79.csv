0,"Alright, so let's see if we could just talk about the moment of the presentation again. I want to try to help you develop some strategies to bring those anxiety symptoms down. ",symp/reasoning,79_0,T,id,,"Theek hai, chalo dekhte hai ki hum kya presentation ke woh lamhe ke baare mein baat kar sakte hai. Main aapse kuch tarike sujhana chahta hoon jisse aap apne tanav ke lakshan ko kam karne mein madad mil sake."
1,"Okay, right. ",inactive,79_1,P,ack,,"Okay, theek hai."
2,"Let's actually go right before the moment so you're still in the, you're still sitting down, and you're getting ready to present. Let's just say your second present. Yeah, like we've talked about and you're thinking they're going to seeming as anxious. They're gonna think I don't belong here. These are the right. Okay. So these thoughts occur because you have an expectation rule one add to that you brought into that class, when you walked into that class, you have these expectations already. It's perfectly natural. It's not right or wrong. Everyone has these beliefs. And whenever these beliefs are and we'll talk about that another point, they combined with the stressor of having this presentation in front of you, right, and the classmates watching you, and they result in these thoughts. We call them automatic thoughts, ",story,79_2,T,id,,"Chalo ham abhi chalte hain, bas soch lo jo vaqt aane wala hai, tum abhi tak baithi ho aur tayyar ho apna prastut karna ke liye. Chalo maan lo aapka doosra prastut hai. Haan, jaise humne baat ki aur tum sochne lagi ho ki woh pareshan dikhte hain. Unhe lagta hai ki main yahan nahi hoon. Ye to sahi hain. Theek hai. To ye vichaar tab hote hain jab tumhare liye kuch ummeede hain jab tum class mein gusse ho, jahan se tumhare saath aaya. Ye bilkul sahi hain. Ye galat nahi hain. Har kisi ke paas yeh vishwas hote hain. Aur jab bhi ye vishwas milte hain aur hum is baare mein baat karte hain, tab yeh stressor ke saath jude rehte hain ke jo tumhare saamne presentation hai, aur class ke saamne jo ate hain aur tumhe dekhte hain, aur yeh vichaar paida karte hain. Hum unhe kehte hain automatic thoughts."
3,okay,inactive,79_3,P,ack,,thik hai
4," And just like the beliefs, they're not good or bad. They don't say anything about the person having them. They're just thoughts. Actually, they're fairly understandable and natural thoughts. The problem is that they lead to symptoms. So, you're sitting there at your desk, and you're thinking, they're gonna see that I'm anxious. They're gonna realize I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough, right? What reaction Do you have when you have that far?",story,79_4,T,id,,"Aur is tarah ke yakin, ve na to acche hain aur na hi bure hain. Ve vyakti ke bare me kuchh nahi kehte. Ve sirf vichaar hain. Asal me, ye kafi samajhne layak aur prakritik vichaar hain. Samasya yah hai ki ve lakshanon tak pahunchate hain. Toh, tum apne daftar mein baith ke soch rahe ho, ki ve dekh lenge ki mujhe chinta hai. Ve samajh jaayenge ki main paryapt nahi hoon. Main paryapt nahi hoon, sahi hain na? Jab aapko ye vichaar aate hain, to aapke kya pratikriya hoti hai?"
5,"I guess I'm like very observant, like I started looking around, like, I'm sweating. Like I'm having physical responses, and I'm looking around to see if anyone's already looking at me, like hyper vigilance.",symp/reasoning,79_5,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta hai ki main kaafi ghoorne waala hoon, jaise hi maine ghoorna shuru kiya, main paaspaas dekhne laga hoon, jaise hi, main paseene se tapak raha hoon. Jaise hi, mere sharir par pratikriya ho rahi hai, main dekh raha hoon ki koi mujhe pahle se hi dekh raha hai, jaise ek gambhir jhaank."
6,so distressing symptoms.,symp/reasoning,79_6,T,id,-1.0,aankh mein dard ki ghatak halaat
7,Yeah.,inactive,79_7,P,ack,,Haan.
8,"What's something that you could send yourself in that moment, that would maybe get in between that thought, and that reaction, so that thought of, I'm not gonna know I'm not good enough. I think I'm not good enough. And that reaction",routine,79_8,T,irq,,"Kya koi aisa cheez hai jo aap apne aap ko uss lamhe mein bhej sakte hain, jo shayad uss soch aur uss pratikriya ke beech mein aa jaaye, jisse woh soch, main achcha nahi hu, aur woh pratikriya ke beech mein aati hai, naa aaye? Mujhe lagta hai ki main achcha nahi hu. Aur yeh pratikriya."
9,"I mean, I think in that moment, most people are looking at the person who's presenting and not at me. And so that, you know, I can maybe like, take some deep breaths or try to calm myself down. Maybe like look over my notes one more time. Because they're all watching the person who is presenting not me.",story,79_9,P,id,,"अरे यार, मेरा मतलब है, मुझे लगता है कि उस वक्त ज्यादातर लोग प्रस्तुत करने वाले व्यक्ति को देख रहे होंगे और मुझे नहीं। अत तुम जानते हो, मैं शायद गहरी सांस ले सकती हूँ या खुद को शांत करने की कोशिश कर सकती हूँ। शायद मैं अपने नोट्स को एक बार फिर देख सकती हूँ। क्योंकि सभी म"
10,"Okay. So some some deep breathing, looking over your notes, like preparing yourself for kind of focusing on that and realizing they're not really looking at you anyway for a moment. Okay, good. Good. Um, you bring your notes with you to class?",routine,79_10,T,id,,"Thik hai. Toh kuch gehri saas lekar, apni notes ko dekhte hue, apne apko tayar karo aur uspe focus karne lago aur tab tumhe realization hoga ki wo tumhe toh actually moment ke liye bhi nahi dekh rahe hain. Thik hai, accha hai. Umm, class mein tum apni notes saath leke aaye ho?"
11,"I mean, like usually have like index cards, or maybe like some stats on something that I want to look over like some numbers or something I don't want to forget.",story,79_11,P,id,,"Mai matlab, jaise ki sadharan taur par mujhe index cards ya fir kuch statistics, kisi cheez ke baare mein jo main dekhna chahta hu, jaise koi numbers ho ya kuch bhi, wo nahi bhulna chahta."
12,Okay. So You always have those with you.,routine,79_12,T,yq,,Theek hai. Toh aapke paas hamesha woh hote hain.
13,Yeah.,inactive,79_13,P,op,,Haan.
14,It's just a matter of can you focus your attention on them?,routine,79_14,T,yq,,यह बस एक मुद्दा है कि क्या आप उन पर अपना ध्यान केंद्रित क
15,"Right, exactly enough to not forget them.",routine,79_15,P,id,,"Sahi, bilkul itna ke unhe bhul na jaane ki."
16,"And you know, if you're focusing on that, and you're thinking about that, you're not thinking about whatever they might be thinking about",routine,79_16,T,crq,,"Aur tu samajh, agar tu uspe dhyan de raha hai, aur tu uske baare mein soch raha hai, tab tu kuch aur ke baare mein soch nahi raha hai jo wo soch rahe honge."
17,"Right, exactly.",inactive,79_17,P,cd,,"Haan, bilkul sahi."
18,And how about the deep breathing? Is that a strategy you've tried before?,routine,79_18,T,irq,,Aur deep breathing ke baare mein kya socha hai? Kya yeh ek tere paas pahle se prayog kiya gaya tareeka hai?
19,"a little bit, but with not much success, because usually when I think to remember it, I'm in, you know, panic mode, and then it's really hard.",routine,79_19,P,id,,"Thodi-thodi, but with not sahi kamyabi, kyunki generally when I think to yaad karna, main, tumhe pata hai, panic mode mein hoti hu, aur uske baad bahut mushkil ho jaata hai."
20,So you've been able to do it sometimes.,routine,79_20,T,crq,,"hinglish---
So tum kabhi kabhi kar paate ho."
21,"Yeah, not often, not consistently.",routine,79_21,P,op,,"Haan, mamuli taur pe, ekdam niyamit taur pe."
