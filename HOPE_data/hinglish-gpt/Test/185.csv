",inactive,185_2,T,gc,0.0,"Aaj aapne aaj aane ke liye shukriya aur hamare survey ko bharne ke liye.

4,Okay. One of the things that that I noticed is that you are not using any kind of birth control right now.,routine,185_4,T,yq,0.0,Thik hai. Ek baat jo maine dekha hai woh hai ki tum abhi koi bhi janm niyantran ka prayog nahi kar rahi ho.
5,Yeah.,inactive,185_5,P,op,0.0,Haan.
6,"And I just wondered if we could talk for a few minutes about some ideas, and I wondered what what your thoughts are about using condoms?",routine,185_6,T,gc,0.0,"Aur main to socha ki hum kuch vichaar ke baare mein kuch baatein kar sakte hai, aur mujhe yeh sooccha ki aapko kya lagta hai condom ka istemaal karne ke baare mein?"
7,"Well, I've heard stuff about them that I don't really need them and they're not going to do much for me and just kind of absolutely go out and get them. So I don't really use them for that reason.",symp/reasoning,185_7,P,od,0.0,"अच्छा, मैंने उनके बारे में सुना है कि मुझे वाकई उनकी जरूरत नहीं है और वे मेरे लिए बहुत कुछ नहीं करेंगे और सिर्फ उन्हें बाहर से भ्रमण करने के लिए ही ले लें। इसलिए मैं उन्हें उसी कारण से"
8,You've heard a lot of negative things about condom usage.,symp/reasoning,185_8,T,crq,0.0,Tune ne condom upyog ke baare mein kayi nuksaandeh baatein sune hai.

10,"Okay. Okay. So Chris, it's okay if I share with you some of the things that I've learned about condom usage and some of the things that my clients that are around your age have shared with me about condom usage. ",routine,185_10,T,crq,0.0,"Thik hai. Thik hai. Toh Chris, agar main apne saath kuch cheezein share karun jo maine condom istemaal ke baare mein seekhi hai aur kuch cheezein jo meri clients jo aapke jaise umar ke hain ne condom istemaal ke baare mein mujhse share ki hai."
11,"Yeah, that's fine. ",inactive,185_11,P,cd,0.0,"Haan, woh theek hai."
12,"Okay. What some people don't realize and don't know about condoms is that may not only prevent help prevent teen pregnancy, but they can also prevent sexually transmitted infections like Flaminia along with HIV. They're really effective in preventing these things. And there's also a lot of easy ways to get condoms these days that some people don't know, the local health departments have condoms and many times they're free. And local pharmacies, drug stores have condoms. And there are a lot of clinics that have them as well either for a small fee or sometimes they're actually free. And there's some some ways to that people have found carrying them around pretty conveniently, you know, in their car or in their pockets because they're pretty small. What does it sound like? As I'm talking what what are what are some thoughts that are going, going through your mind?",routine,185_12,T,id,0.0,"Okay. Kuch log nahi samajhte aur nahi jante ki condom sirf teenagers ki garbhdharan ko rokne mein hi madad nahi karta, balki Flaminia aur HIV jaisi sexually transmitted infections se bachane mein bhi kaafi kaargar ho sakta hai. Ye kaam kartey hain in cheezo se bachne mein bahut asardar hai.
Aur aajkal condom paane ka kai aasan tarike hain jo kuch log nahi jaante, sthaaniya swasthya vibhag mein condom hain aur aksar ye bilkul muft hote hain. Sath hi, drug stores aur chemists mein bhi condom hote hain. Aur clinics bhi hain jaha ye condom miltey hain chote se fees ke naate ya phir kuch baar bilkul muft bhi hote hain. Aur logon ne aasaani se inse sath rakhey jaaney ke kuch tareeke dhundh liye hain, chahiye unhey apni gaadi mein ya apne pochon mein rakhna ho, kyunki ye kaafi chote hote hain. Ye kaisa lagta hai? Jab main baat kar rahi hoon, kya kya khyaal aapke dimaag mein guzar rahe hain?"
13,"Definitely changing my mind about condoms a little bit, think there's no hurt and just carrying them with me. And if they do protect against all that stuff that you said, that sounds a lot better than what I have heard. I definitely want to avoid all those consequences. ",symp/reasoning,185_13,P,id,0.0,"Pakka meri dil mein thodi si badalaw hone ka irada kar raha hu, soch raha hu ki koi nuksaan nahi hoga aur bas inko mere saath rakhne se kaam chal jayega. Agar ye sab chizon se bachaav karte hai, jaise ke tu ne kaha, toh ye sunne se bohot accha lagta hai. Mujhe toh pakka woh sab natije se bachna hai."
14,Okay. Yeah. You're not interested in becoming a father right now I'm guessing.,routine,185_14,T,crq,0.0,Theek hai. Haan. Mummy-papa banne ke iraadhe hain abhi tak nahi hai mujhe lagta.
15,Yeah.,inactive,185_15,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
16,"Okay. Okay. Great. Well, can I ask you? So after this conversation today on a scale of zero to 10, with zero being that it's not at all important to you and 10 being that it's extremely important? Where do you think you fall with how important you know taking a chance on using condoms would be to you now?",routine,185_16,T,irq,0.0,"Theek hai. Theek hai. Maja aa gaya. Acha, main aapse pooch sakta hoon? Aaj ki baatcheet ke baad, zero se 10 ke beech, jahan zero par yeh aapke liye bilkul mahatvapat nahi aur 10 par yeh aapke liye bahut hi mahatvapurn hai, wahan aapko lagta hai ki ab aapke liye condom prayog mein koi mauka lena kitna mahatvapurn hoga?"
17,"after everything that you've told me, sounds pretty important to me. I like an eight or nine.",routine,185_17,P,id,0.0,"तुमने मुझे जो कुछ भी बताया है, मुझे बहुत महत्वपूर्ण लगता है। मुझे आठ या"
18,"Okay. Okay, well, that's great. It sounds like you really have have, you know a plan in mind? What do you think you'll do next Like what do you think would be a next step with you as far as contraception or condoms?",routine,185_18,T,gc,0.0,"Okay. Thik hai, accha toh yeh sunne mein aaya hai ki aapke paas sach mein ek plan hai. Aapko lagta hai aap agle kadam mein kya karenge? Contraception ya condoms ke mamle mein aapko kya lagta hai ki aap agla kadam kya hoga?"
19,I will go out and look for some condoms and have an open mind to them.,routine,185_19,P,od,0.0,Main thoda bahar jaunga aur kuch condoms dhundhne ki koshish karunga aur unhe khuli dimaag se apnuga.
20,"Okay, well, we've got some here at the clinic. Would you like me to give you some on your way out?",routine,185_20,T,gc,0.0,"Thik hai, dekho, humare paas clinic me kuch hai. Kya aap chale jaate samay mujhe thodi diya chahte ho?"
21,yeah,inactive,185_21,P,op,0.0,haan
22,And you can just take them with you.,inactive,185_22,T,gc,0.0,Aur tum bas unhe apne saath le sakte ho.
