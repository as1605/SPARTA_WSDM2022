0,"You okay now kind of taking a look at some of your thinking and situation from that point of view, okay. Some things kind of stand out for me and hearing you talk about what's been happening and your feelings I can appreciate. It's really painful. And I would say to the reader that you can step back and try to look at the thoughts. I think that you'll see it's it's helpful although I know It's a little difficult or unusual to separate feelings from thoughts sometimes. But I'd like to try to kind of distinguish between the two. Okay. You said that you've been at your job for about five years. You really like your job. So tell me about your job, like kind of how you felt about it, but frame it in a time before this ever happened.",routine,2_0,T,id,,"Tum ab theek ho, ek jhalak mai dekhne se apne khayal aur halat ki kuch chize dikhayi deti hai, theek hai. Kuch batein mere liye samajhne layak hai aur jab tum uske bare mai baat karte ho aur tumhari feelings ke bare mai sunta hu toh main iska mahtva samajh sakta hu. Aur ye sach mein bahut takleef de hai. Aur mai paathakon ko yeh bata dena chahunga ki tum peeche hat sakte ho aur apne khayalon ko dekh sakte ho. Mujhe lagta hai ki jab tum dekhoge toh yeh madadgar hoga lekin mujhe pata hai ki kabhi kabhi feelings ko thoughts se alag karna thoda mushkil hota hai. Par mai isse alag karne ki koshish karna chahta hu. Theek hai. Tumne bataya ki tumhare job mai lagbhag paanch saal se ho. Tum apne job ko bahut pasand karte ho. Toh meri baat karo apne job ke bare mai, kis tarah se tum iske bare mai mehsoos karte the, lekin isse pehle hua hua yeh sab kabhi nahi hua tha."
1,"I like my job because I felt like I was helping people. So it was meaningful. And, you know, when I went there, Time went by fast. So it was kind of like, I was enjoying myself, you know, not super fast. I wasn't having the best time of my life, but it was something where I would go and you know, I felt like I was doing something important and the day didn't drag on and, you know, I got along with my co workers and that kind of thing. So it felt meaningful to me. meaningful.",story,2_1,P,id,2.0,"Mujhe apni naukri pasand hai kyunki main lagta tha ki main logon ki madad kar raha tha. Isliye yeh maayne rakhti thi. Aur, pata hai, jab main wahan jaata, samay tez se guzar jaata tha. Isliye jaise main mazaa utha raha tha, koi zyada tezi nahin thi. Meri zindagi ki sabse behtareen waqt toh nahi tha, lekin yeh woh jagah thi jahan main jaata tha aur main apna zaroori kaam kar raha tha aur din lamba nahin lagta tha, aur mera co-workers ke saath achhe talukat the aur woh tarah ki cheezein. Isliye yeh mere liye maayne rakhta tha."
2,"So you remember accomplishing things at that job that you felt benefits society, the people you help.",routine,2_2,T,crq,,"Kya tujhe yaad hai ki us kaam mein tune kuch kaamyaabi haasil ki thi jo samajh ke liye faydemand tha, un logo ki madad ki jinki tu madad karta tha."
3,"Yeah, I feel like, you know, doing my job, I got to know people, you know, help people out with things that they needed. You know, when things were bad I could, you know, get kids out of situations that were really dangerous for them and, you know, no one else was going to do that for them. So I felt like I was the kind of person that was making keeping people safe. I guess.",story,2_3,P,cd,,"Haan, main waisa hi feel karta hoon, tu jaanta hai, apna kaam karne ka, main logon ko jaanta tha, tu jaanta hai, unki madad karne mein, jis cheez ki unhe zaroorat thi. Tu jaanta hai, jaise hi haalat kharab hote the main, tu jaanta hai, bachchon ko unke liye khataron se bachata tha aur tu jaanta hai, koi aur yeh kaam nahi kar raha tha unke liye. Isliye mujhe aisa lagta tha ki main us tarah ka insaan tha jo logon ko surakshit rakhta tha. Main maanta hoon."
4,You kept people safe. And you had a lot of satisfaction from the work you did. And now doesn't feel that way?,routine,2_4,T,yq,,Tumne logon ko surakshit rakha. Aur tumko tumhare kiye kaam se bahut khushi mili. Aur ab kya waisa nahin lag raha?
5," Now, not at all. ",routine,2_5,P,on,-1.0,"अब, कहीं भी नहीं"
6,"When you described it, it almost sounds like you talked about how you're afraid of making a mistake. You're thinking about yourself in a way where you're almost risk.",symp/reasoning,2_6,T,crq,,"Jab aapne isko varnan kiya, to yeh lagta hai ki aapne apne galti karne se darrne ke baare mein baat ki hai. Aap khud ke baare mein aise soch rahe hain jaise aap almost risk mein hain."
7,"Yeah, I was just about to say it feels dangerous. To be there like to do my job, it feels dangerous.",symp/reasoning,2_7,P,id,-2.0,"Haan, main bas abhi kahne ja raha tha ki yeh khatarnaak lag raha hai. Wahan jaane mein aur wahan mera kaam karne mein, yeh khatarnaak lag raha hai."
8,"Your your work right now even though you have this one, situations extremely stressful and hard on you. You have other families that you interact with now to you tell me about those interactions.",routine,2_8,T,id,,Abhi abhi apka kam hai par tension bahut hai aur mushkil par hai. Abhi aapke pass aur families hai jinse aap ab interact karte hai mujhe un interactions ke baare me bataiye.
9,"I mean, I guess it's like, quantitatively the same as before. I do the same things with families. But now I kind of feel like I can't trust my own judgment like everything. Before everything just kind of felt a little more black and white, and now it just feels like everything is so much a shade of gray that I just can't tell. You know what's right and what's wrong anymore. And every time I feel like I have a good instinct I doubt it I question it I have all these ideas of, well, you know, if I remove the kids from this family, what if they're not really doing the things? I think they're doing? Like what if the parents are actually good parents? What if the kids get put into a home that's bad for them?",story,2_9,P,id,-2.0,"Mai yeh maanti hoon, mujhe lagta hai, adhyayn se ginaavashesh roop se pehle jaisa hi hai. Main parivar ke saath wahi karta hoon. Lekin ab main aise mehsoos karti hoon ke mujhe apni apni raay par vishwaas nahi hai, jaise sab kuch. Pehle sab kuch thoda zyaada kaala aur safed lagta tha, lekin ab lagta hai sab cheezon mein itna sa khancha hai ke main pehchan hi nahi paati. Pata hai kya, ab kaunsa sahi hai aur kaunsa galat. Har bar jab mujhe lagta hai ke mere andar ek sahih ahsas hai, main uspe shaq karti hoon, uspe sawaal karti hoon, sochti hoon ke agar main bacchon ko is parivaar se alag kar doon, toh kya voh sach mein yeh sab kar rahe hain? Kya agar maata-pita sach mein ache maata-pita hain? Kya agar bacche ek aisi ghar mein daale jaate hain jo unke liye buri hai?"
10,So this is maybe what's different. This what you're saying from before till now? Is decisions seemed clear cut.,routine,2_10,T,id,,So yeh hai jo alag ho sakta hai. Yeh wohi hai jo tum pehle se lekar ab tak keh rahe ho? Kya decisions saaf dikhai dete the.
11,"Yeah, sometimes it was tougher than others, but it just seemed more like I could make a decision and kind of wipe my hands of it and, you know, move on to the next thing. And now I just feel like there's all these doubts in my head and all these questions about if I'm doing the right thing.",story,2_11,P,id,,"Haan, kabhi kabhi yeh dusri baar se bahut jyada mushkil tha, lekin mujhe bas esa lagta tha ki maine faisla le liya aur apne kaam se hata liya aur agle kaam par focus kar liya. Par ab lagta hai mere dimaag mein kai sare shaq aur sawaal hai, kya main sahi kar raha hoon?"
12,"All right. So you're looking inward, you're looking at yourself a lot of self doubt. Now you're looking at decisions as much more difficult. It's much more difficult to come to the right decision. And second guessing sounds like move to second guessing a bit. When you do make a decision, like playing over over your mind. What could go wrong here? Is that the thought you're having?",routine,2_12,T,irq,,"Theek hai. Toh tum andar ki aur dekh rahe ho, tum apne aap par bahut saare self doubt kar rahe ho. Ab tum mutthi bhar ke faislon ki taraf dekh rahe ho, bahut zyada mushkil lag rahe hai. Sahi faisla lene ka kaam ab bahut zyada mushkil ho gaya hai. Aur doosri bari sochon par duvidha jaise ki kuch samajh nahi aa rahi hai. Jab tum faisla lete ho, dimaag mein phir se wahi baat aati hai. Yahan kuch galat ho sakta hai? Kya yeh hi tumhare dimaag mein chal rahi hai?"
13,"Yeah, yeah, definitely. I feel like I'm second guessing everything.",symp/reasoning,2_13,P,id,-2.0,"Haan, haan, pakka. Mujhe lagta hain ki main har cheez par dubara soch rahi hoon."
14,summary,"The patient loves their job and has been very helpful by saving kids from dangerous sitations. But it doesn't feel like that anymore. The patient is afraid recently of making a mistake in their job. The patient does the same as before, but now they are not able to trust their own judgement. They are having self doubts and second guessing everything.",,,,,
