Toh tumko pata hoga ki yeh hua aur phir main puri sheher mein ghoomke tumhari behen ko dhoondna pada kyunki tumko pata hai woh apne tareeke se kaam kar rahi thi.

53,"physical abuse, I guess I try to end fights with violence, I guess, because I know how bad it can get. So I've tried to shut it down really fast, but probably not the most healthiest way. What's been the honest, that's why I think my sister and me are close. And so I blame my mom for that because she used me as the scapegoat. And then my sister was like, Oh, well, that's the bad sister.",story,31_53,P,id,,"Physical abuse, main sochta hu ke main jhagde ko hinsa se khatam kar du, kyunki main jaanta hu ki kitna bura ho sakta hai. Isliye maine bahut jaldi usko bandh karne ki koshish ki, par shayad yeh sabse swasth tarika nahi hai. Sach kya tha yeh jo ki meri behen aur main bahut kareeb hain. Aur is baat ke liye main apni maa ko dhoondta hu, kyunki unhone mujhe nishana banaya tha. Aur phir meri behen kuch aisa kehti thi, ki, Oh, wohi buri behen hai."
