And it just happens to me all the time.",symp/reasoning,114_1,P,id,-1.0,"Arrey dekho, suno na, yeh mere liye yeh hafta achha nahi raha hai aur main tumhe meri dikkato ke baare mein bata rahi hu ki mera boyfriend aur hum broke up ho gaye aur main iske saath cope nahi kar pa rahi hu. I'm hurt. Tum bas samajh nahi rahe ho ki yeh kyun ho raha hai ek aur baar. Sirf ek baar. Aur yeh mujhe hamesha hi hota hai."

3,"it won't get better and you don't understand. It happens to me all the time. Meaning given to me now, serving in the wrong with me. I feel like there's something really wrong with me. People don't just reject me all the time. I don't know why. ",story,114_3,P,id,,"""it won't get better and you don't understand. Yeh mere saath hamesha hota hai. Ab mujhe samajh aaya hai ki mere saath galat ho raha hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki mere saath kuch bahut hi galat ho raha hai. Log hamesha mujhe reject nahi karte. Mujhe nahi pata kyun."""

5,"Now he doesn't want to talk to me and I feel like if I was, if I was a better person, then this wouldn't happen. I just feel like, isn't because of me. Nobody understands and I just can't do this. I can't do this again.",story,114_5,P,id,,"Abhi uss se baat karna nahi chahta aur mujhe lagta hai ki agar main, agar main ek behtar insaan hota, toh yeh na hota. Bas mujhe aisa lagta hai, meri wajah se nahi hai. Koi nahi samajh sakta aur main yeh nahi kar sakti. Main phirse yeh nahi kar sakti."
6,"I mean, I Has there been other stuff that's been going on for you during the week?",routine,114_6,T,irq,,"मतलब, क्या तुम्हारे हफ्ते के दौरान और कोई चीजें हुई हैं?"

I cant' sleep and I can't eat And he just keeps going and he just won't answer the phone and why you need me and you just don't,symp/reasoning,114_7,P,id,-1.0,Usne mujhse pichhle din hi break up kar liya hai. Main so nahi sakti aur main khana nahi kha pa rahi hoon Aur wo bas aise hi aage badhta ja raha hai aur wo bas phone ka jawab nahi de raha aur tumhe mujhe zaroorat hai lekin tum bas nahi samjh raho.
8,"want to know I know that when you break up with someone, it's really upsetting. Over time, this sort of stuff should get better, I think.",routine,114_8,T,id,,"मुझे पता है कि जब आप किसी से अलग होते हैं, तो यह बहुत ही दुखद होता है। समय के साथ, मुझे लगता है कि इस तरह की चीजें बेहत"
9,how long?,routine,114_9,P,crq,,Kitni der tak?
10,"Well, it just takes a bit of time.",routine,114_10,T,cd,,"Accha, bas ek thoda sa samay lag jaata hai."
11,I can't make it through the time he may help me get through the time it gets. This time. It just feels like it's never gonna end. When is that?,routine,114_11,P,irq,,"Main time mein, main us insan ki madad se bhi main is samay se guzar jaunga, lekin ye samay ki baat hai. Is samay, ye lagta hai ki ye kabhi khatam ho hi nahi raha hai. Ye kab hoga?"
12,"It certainly sounds really tough. I think it's important that we talk about other stuff also, though, that went on during the week other than the breakup.",routine,114_12,T,id,,"Yeh toh bilkul mushkil lagta hai. Main toh samajhta hoon ki humein dusri cheezein bhi zaroor discuss karni chahiye, haan lekin, jo hafta bita breakup ke alawa."

14,I can see that's really upsetting.,routine,114_14,T,id,,Main dekh sakta hun ki yeh sach mein ek disturbing baat hai.
15,Because He rejected me because I'm not good enough. Maybe there's something inside me that's been broken or something. And I won't even talk to me now. I need someone that say that it's gonna be okay. And it's okay.,symp/reasoning,114_15,P,id,-1.0,Kyunki wohne mujhe reject kardiya kyunki main achcha kaafi nahi hun. Shayad mujhme se kuch toot gaya hai ya kuch aisa. Aur woh abhi mujhse bhi baat nahi kar raha hai. Mujhe kisi aise insaan ki zarurat hai jo kah sake ki sab theek ho jayega. Aur sab theek hai.
16,Sure it will be fine in the long term. Even though it's tough right now.,routine,114_16,T,ack,,Ji sure iski long term mein thik ho jayegi. Vaise bhi abhi toh mushkil hai.
