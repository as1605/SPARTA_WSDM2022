0," All right, Chris, so I need to talk to you because as you know, we have a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school and as as athletic director, it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule and I've been hearing some chatter from some other kids about party this weekend, and from what I hear while you were there, and you know, I can't confirm or deny anything. So I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences. But I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how, you know, you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams.",symp/reasoning,138_0,T,gc,0.0,"Chris, main to tere saath baat karna hai kyunki jaisa tu jaanta hai, humare school mein drugs aur alcohol ka bilkul bhi bardaasht nahi hota aur as a athletic director, ye meri zimmedari hai ki humare student athletes ko check karein aur dekhein ki koi bhi ye niyam par amal kar raha hai ya nahi. Aur mujhe kuch khabar mili hai ki is weekend party ke baare mein aur tu bhi waha tha, aur tu jaanta hai, main confirm ya deny nahi kar sakta. Isliye abhi mujhe tujhe saza deni se pahle baat karni hogi. Magar main tujhse baat karna chahta hu ki kya tu sharab pi raha hai aur haan, tu ek team member ke tor par is tarah nahi kar sakta hai."
1," All right, actually, I do want to speak to you about something that happened during this past weekend. Usually, as you know, I'm an honor student, I usually am studying over the weekend, my parents told me go out to parties, but I kind of use that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to. And when I when I got there, like, I'm not used to this like party environment, where everything that you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason. And because I was there in the moment, I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else is doing. So I wouldn't be I wouldn't be ostracized. ",story,138_1,P,gc,-1.0,"Theek hai, ab actual mein, mujhe tumse kuch baat karni hai jo is hafte ke guzarish me hua hai. Usually, jaisa ki tum jaante ho, mai ek honor student hun, mai hamesha hafte ke din padhai karta hun, mere ma-baap ne kaha ki mai party mein jaau, lekin maine uska faaida uthaya aur apni ma-baap ko manaane ke liye apni doston ke pressure me jaane ke liye party mein gaya. Aur jab main waha pahucha, waha par mujhe yeh party environment pasand nahi aaya, jaha par jo sab kuch films mein dikhta hai wahi hota hai, jaise log bottle se pee rahe hote hain ya masti kar rahe hote hain alcohol ke saath. Aur main wahi mauke mein tha, to maine bhi pressure mehsoos kiya ki mujhe karna hoga aur dusron ke saath conform hona hoga. Taki mujhe na bahar nikaala jaaye."

Jaise, hum sab wahan pahunche hai. Thik hai. Tum jante ho, main bhi high school mein tha. Tumhe pata hai, main bhi peeta hoon. Main samajhta hoon.

3,"I know that. It's bad for me. It's bad for my body is bad for for, for for being on the team for being an athlete. it hinders my performance.

It's not good for me. It's not good for my body and neither for being in the team or an athlete. It impacts my performance. Personally pata nahi, I feel like my friends forced me.
