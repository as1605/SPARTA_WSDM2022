0,"So now as you kind of take a emotional inventory of your stress and worry and anxiety and you scale it, how would you put yourself now?",symp/reasoning,132_0,T,irq,,"Abhi abhi jab tum apne stress, chinta aur chintey bhare dimaag ka samaan karte ho, to usse thoda thoda pemaan lekar khud ko kaise feel karoge?"
1,I think is probably closer to three now feeling more hopeful and kind of not feeling I guess maybe feeling like it's a little bit less of a big deal than I felt like when I came in,symp/reasoning,132_1,P,id,1.0,"Mujhe lagta hai ki ab shayad yeh teen ke paas jyada qareeb hai, aur main ab umeed se aur thodi se naazuk mehsoos kar raha hoon, shayad main ab aisa feel nahi kar raha ki yeh jab main andar aaya tha jaise bohot bada mamla tha."
2,"so some of the some of the intimidation of the concerns have been relaxed a bit as backed off,",symp/reasoning,132_2,T,crq,,अतः कुछ कुछ चिंताओं के साथ कुछ थोड़ा हो रहा है क्योंकि उन्होंने पीछे हटा दिया था।
3,"it comes and goes,",symp/reasoning,132_3,P,cd,-2.0,yeh aati jati rehti hai
4,"it's still there. Three is still suffering, but not as much as before. And not nearly as much as the peak. ",symp/reasoning,132_4,T,id,,"Ye abhi bhi hai. Teen abhi bhi dukh raha hai, lekin pehle ki tarah nahi. Aur usse kahin zyada nahin, peak ki tarah."
5,"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,132_5,P,ack,-2.0,"Haan, haan."
6,"Do you think going forward, you can apply this self talk in the morning, when that automatic clock comes up, like we make that kind of plan.",routine,132_6,T,yq,,"Kya aapko lagta hai, aage jaakar aap subah iss self talk ko apply kar sakte ho, jab woh automatic clock aata hai, jaise hi hum uss tarah ka plan banate hain."
7,"Yeah, I think that'll be good because then also in the morning, I'll remember it's the morning and having these thoughts I need to do this.",routine,132_7,P,op,1.0,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki yeh acha hoga kyunki phir subah mein main yaad rakhunga ki yeh subah hai aur yeh khayal mujhe yeh kaarna hai."
8,"There are a lot of places we're going to go. As we talk about CBT and how it relates to what you're going through. I don't want to put too much on you at one time. So I'm kind of deliberately not going to a long explanation, the theory and not assigned A lot of homework, the homework is an important part of it. Okay? And one that I feel is in the best interest of clients to really take seriously and make a best effort to do. Okay. So, I'd like that to be one of the, you know, if you're okay with it, that'd be one homework steps, and the other one. So just just be two things for this week. So that self talk in the morning, and the other one was, is really just starting to cultivate an awareness in the day of when you're having these automatic thoughts. So these automatic thoughts proceed. feelings, and behaviors that you don't like, like feeling worried. So they're a little hard to pick up at first, because you're already having the feeling before you even think, to think about the thought, if that makes sense. And there's a few steps But you're already having the feeling of worry. And now I'm asking you to stop in that moment and try to recover the thought that led to that. Yeah. So that's not an easy request, satisfied to starting out with just try to bring up an awareness of that. If you can, I think super helpful, the best way is to write it down, if it's safe to do so. And if you can't, okay. So perhaps sometime today, you find yourself extra worried. And then you think back to what was going through your mind. And you find it was worrying about the welfare of the family, like a thought like, oh, they're not doing so well. Just don't judge the thought. Just write down. I was thinking to the family that might not be doing so well.",story,132_8,T,id,,"Hum bahut saare jagah pe jaane wale hain. Jab hum CBT ke baare mein baat karte hain aur kaise yeh aapke saath juda hua hai, tab hum aap par zyada bojh nahi daalna chahte hain. Isliye main samjha deliberately bahut lambi tafseel nahi baantne ja raha hoon, woh teoriyon ki aur homework se mutasir na hone dijiye. Theek hai? Aur main yeh feel karta hoon ki clients ke liye yeh behad zaruri hai ke aap ise serious le aur poori koshish karein. Main chahta hoon ki yeh ek homework step ho, agar aap theek hain toh. Aur doosra kya hai.... Haan yeh hafta yeh do kaam hain bas. Toh yeh self-talk subah ko aur dusra yeh hai ke aap din mein apne thoughts ke baare mein pehle se hi jaanke rehna shuru karein. Yeh automatic thoughts, jise aapko pasand nahi hai, iske aage ke feelings aur behaviour aate hain, jaise ke chinta ho rahi hai. Ab pehle hi se pehle unhe pakadna thoda mushkil hai kyunki aap feelings se pehle hi woh soch dekh rahe hain, sochna jaise ki. Aur yeh kuch kadam hain ismein, lekin aap jo bhi tension ho rahi hai uss pal mein rok ke uss thought ko dhundhne ki koshish karein. Haan. Toh yeh toh asaan sawaal nahi hai, shuruaat mein hum bass iss baare mein jaan baate hain. Agar aap kar sakte hain toh woh bhi bahut faydemand ho sakta hai, iss kaam mein. Jaise aap likhte ho, agar aapko safe lagta hai. Aur agar aap nahin kar sakte toh theek hai. Ho sakta hai ki aapko kahin aaj tension ho jaye. Aur phir aap apne dimaag mein wapas jaake dekhna ki kya soch rahe they. Aur aap poora dialogue dobrai aneko mein kar lo. Main aapka thought ka judgement nahi chahta hoon. Bass likh do ki main family ke baare mein tension le raha tha. Ki woh sahi tarah se nahi hain."
9,Okay. What should I do with it? Should I like write it on a sticky note and get rid of it? Should I keep it in a journal or?,routine,132_9,P,ack,,"""Theek hai. Iss ke saath main kya karun? Kya main usse kisi sticky note par likh ke usse chhod dun? Kya main usse ek diary mein rakhoon ya?"""
10,"Good question. I would say keep in touch. journal, okay, and bring it in. To the extent you're comfortable talking about, we can go over. Okay. And we'll try to together develop self talk to address that. Okay. So we're going to build, we're going to build an inventory of adaptive responses. Okay. Does that make sense? Do you have any questions about or concerns about today in common we talked about?",routine,132_10,T,cd,,"Good sawal hai. Main yeh kehna chahunga stay connected. diary, thik hai, and le aao. Jitna aapko comfortable ho, hum discuss kar sakte hain. Thik hai. Aur hum saath milkar self talk develop karenge usse handle karne ke liye. Thik hai. To hum adaptive responses ka ek stock taiyar karenge. Thik hai. Kya aapko samajh me aaya? Aaj ke baare me koi sawal ya chinta hai?"
11,"No, I mean, I think it was really helpful. I just had to remember to, you know, kind of combat things in the morning and then as the day goes by, if I notice any other thoughts, just write it down and everything. I can do that.",routine,132_11,P,on,,"Nahi, yaar, main toh samajhta hu ki yeh kafi madadgar tha. Bas mujhe, pata hai, subah uthkar kuch chize ladna padta tha phir din bhar ke hote hue, agar mujhe koi aur khayal aata tha, toh bas mein usko likh deta tha aur saari baatein samajh jata tha. Yeh main karsakta hu."
12,"I think that would be a great start. And we'll set up a time for down here for another point for next week. We'll get that all situated. But I want to Close just by letting you know, kind of my impressions from on this first session. Okay. I know you have worries, and I am working on understanding them with the family and the decision you made and I can certainly appreciate it's it's a struggle for you. At the same time I see somebody very conscientious. No, you're, you're very concerned about the work you do. You're concerned about the people you're act with. compassionate, empathetic. I see a lot of strength in terms of your ability to understand these concepts I'm talking about and apply them in your life. So I want you to take away from this I hope you take away from this, that you should be helpful. I feel like you have a lot of positive characteristics and strengths that you Bring to overcome the struggle, and I think you'll be stronger as a result of working to overcome. Does that resonate with you? How do you think of yourself?",story,132_12,T,id,,"मुझे लगता है कि यह एक महान शुरुआत होगी। और हम अगले सप्ताह के लिए एक अगले समय का सायसट बैठेंगे। हम उसे ठीक कर देंगे। लेकिन मैं आपको बता देना चाहता हूं कि इस पहले सेशन के मैं इम्प्रेशन से। ठीक है। मुझे पता है कि आपके चिंते हैं, और मैं परिवार और आपके लिए निर्णय करने की बात पर विचार कर रहा हूं। और मैं इस बात को बढ़ाने वाले रूप से स्वीकार कर सकता हूं कि आपके लिए एक संघर्ष है। उसी समय मुझे कुछ बहुत सावधान लगता है। नहीं है, तुम बहुत जिम्मेदार हो। नहीं है, आप जो काम करते हैं उसके बारे में बहुत चिंता करते हैं। आप अपने जीवन में इन अवधारणाओं को समझने और उन्हें लागू करने के लिए आपकी क्षमता में बहुत सारी ताकत देखते हैं। इसलिए मैं चाहता हूं कि आप इस से यह बात चाहिए कि आप कामयाब हो। मुझे ऐसा लगता है कि आप में कई सकारात्मक गुण और ताकत हैं जो आपको स्ट्रगल से उभरने में मदद करेंगे, और मुझे लगता है कि आप स्ट्रगल से बलवान होंगे। क्या आपको यह दिलचस्प लगता है? आप स्वयं को कैसे मानते हैं?"
13,"Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, I've worked a lot to help other people. So I think I probably do have the ability to help myself as well. And I also believe that, you know, if I do the work, then in the future, when stuff makes me stressed out, I might be a little better at handling it.",routine,132_13,P,id,1.0,"Haal, main toh yahi kehta hu ki maine bahut mehnat kari hai doosron ki madad karne mein. Toh shayad mujhe apne aap ki madad karne ki kshamata bhi hogi. Aur main yeh bhi maanta hu ki agar main kaam karu, toh future mein, jab cheezein mujhe stress deti hai, main usse thoda behtar tarike se handle kar sakunga."
14,"Yeah, so I hope that you'll be able to overcome what's going on now. But also build a skill set that you can use to overcome new challenges, because you'll face new ones. And I want you to be the most prepared you can be I feel like even though you have these worries and anxieties, I want I'd like you to remember you have a lot of strengths. I feel like you can do pretty well with this. So we'll stop there. If You're good and we'll set you up for appointments next week.",routine,132_14,T,id,,"Haan, toh main umeed karta hoon ke abhi jo chal raha hai usko tum paar kar paoge. Par saath hi ek aisa kaushal bhi banaye jo tum naye challenges ka saamna karne mein istemal kar sakte ho, kyunki naye challenges bhi aayenge. Aur main chahta hoon ke tum sabse zyada taiyaar ho, mujhe lagta hai ke tumhare paas yeh chintaayein aur ghabraahatein toh hai, par main chahta hoon ke tum apane bahut saare taakat yaad rakh sako. Main lagta hai ke tum is se kaafi accha kar paoge. Toh ab befikar ho jao. Agar tum theek ho toh hum agle hafte ke liye tumhaare liye appointments set kar denge."
