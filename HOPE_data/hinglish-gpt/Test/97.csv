3,"Yeah, I'm, I'm recently married. And so my husband and I moved in together. And up until then I I've lived by myself. My whole adult life. So apparently the craziest things have been happening. While I've been sleeping. several, several nights I've woken him up screaming. I'm screaming. Apparently a very vulgar, profane, profane the words and So that's a little alarming to him. And I've even, you know, we've been hitting him in the middle of the night. You know, he's waking up with these huge bruises on his arms. And so yeah, apparently, a behavior in the middle of the night is out of hand.",symp/reasoning,97_3,P,id,,"Haan, main shaadi shuda hoon. Aur mere pati aur main saath mein rehne lage hain. Aur pehle se main akela rehti thi. Apni puri badepan ki zindagi mein. To lagta hai ki behad ajeeb halaat ho rahe hain. Jab main so rahi hoti hoon. Kuch raaton mein maine use jaga diya hain cheekhkar. Chilla rahi hoon. Lagta hai ki mujhse behad gandi galiyan nikal rahi hain. Aur isliye uske liye yeh thoda khatarnaak hai. Aur maine usko beech raat mein bhi maar dala hai. Pata nahi kyun subah uth kar uske haath par bade ghaav dekhne ko milte hain. Aur haan, lagta hai ki beech raat ke vyavhar par kaboo na ho raha hai."
4,So I can understand why that would be distressing. Have you seen a physician about this?,symp/reasoning,97_4,T,yq,,Toh main samajh sakta hu ki aisa kyun pareshan karne wala hoga. Kya aapne is bare mein kisi doctor se baat ki hai?
5,"Yes. Um, I participated in a sleep study and what they say they rolled out some some other things and thought that maybe it was a behavior, Sleep Disorder. So they have referred me to you, I'm still working with them. Now. They're still running some tests and everything but they thought maybe there are some other stressors or underlying things, so",symp/reasoning,97_5,P,id,,"Haan. Uh, maine ek neend adhyayan mein hissa liya aur unhone kuch aur cheezein layi aur socha ke shayad yeh ek vyavahar, neend ka vikar hai. Isliye woh aapko meri taraf se refer kar diye hai, main abhi bhi unke saath kaam kar rahi hun. Abhi bhi woh kuch tests kar rahe hain aur sab kuchh pehle se jaise hi laga lekin unhe lagaa ki shayad kuchh aur dabi hui chizon ya mool karan ho."
6,that might be going on. So what would you like from counseling?,routine,97_6,T,irq,,Wo kahin ho sakta hai. Toh tum counselling se kya chahte ho?
7,"Colby? Um, well, I'm just little worried that it's going to affect my marriage and that my husband will not be able to deal with that. So I would just really like to figure out how to keep my relationship with Him successful with it. So overcome these issues.",routine,97_7,P,id,,"Colby? Um, well, main thoda tension mein hoon ki yeh meri shaadi ko prabhavit kar sakta hai aur mera pati isse deal nahi kar payenge. Isliye main bas yeh jaan'na chahti hoon ki main apne rishte ko kaise Him ke saath safal rakhu. Isliye in samasyao ko paar karna zaroori hai."
8,"So, after you were yelling things, or you hit him, like you're asleep during this time, when you wake up, what's going through your mind then?",routine,97_8,T,orq,,"इसलिए, जब आप चीखते थे, या आपने उसे मारा, जैसे आप इस समय सो रहे हैं, जब आप जागते हैं, तो आपके दिमाग में क्या चल रहा ह"
9,"Usually I wake up and he's like, what are you doing? I was having the worst dream. So those dreams are kind of what he's telling me are aligning. What my behavior is, my dreams are aligning with those. So you know, I don't feel anything. It doesn't feel like I've been anything. I have. I've met a couple times and woken up, but no people do that. So I didn't really think anything of it. But now I'm starting to wonder. Yeah, it's it's a little strange. So Oh, concerning.",story,97_9,P,id,,"Usually mai jagta hoon aur wo kehta hai, kya kar rahe ho? Mere sabse bura sapna tha. To wo jo mujhe bata raha hai wo mere sapno ke saath jode hue hain. Meri harkaton se, mere sapne unse jude hue hain. To pata nahi, mai kuch mehsoos nahi kar raha. Mai kuch baar mil bhi chuka hoon aur uth gaya hoon, par log aisa karte hain. Isliye mai kuch sochta nahi tha. Lekin ab mujhe shaq ho raha hai. Haan, yeh thoda ajeeb hai. Lekin oh, chinta ki koi baat nahi hai."
10,Sorry. I wonder if you have this disorder before?,routine,97_10,T,irq,,Sorry. Mujhe yeh sochne mein samasya hai ki kya aapke paas pehle se yeh bimari hai?
11,"Yeah, I mean, I would, I wouldn't have known. I've lived by myself. But you know, I, before I had fallen out of bed a couple times, and, you know, my sheets and pillows are always everywhere when I wake up, but I didn't really think anything of it. So kind of making the connections now.",story,97_11,P,id,,"Haan, main, mai toh kar leta, mujhe pata nahi hota tha. Main akela rehta tha. Par tumhe pata hai na, maine kai baar bistar se gir gaya tha, aur, tumhe pata hai, jab main uthta hoon mere bedsheet aur pillow hamesha idhar udhar pade rehte hain, par mujhe iska kuch bada matlab nahi tha. Lekin ab main sab jod raha hoon."
12,"So he's been paying attention to what's going on with your sleep. Does the episode of yelling or moving around, does it happen a certain time limit? Like what happened right after you go to sleep or a while",routine,97_12,T,irq,,"Toh woh tumhare neend ya soye hue waqt par ho rahe kuch v Baaten par dhyan de raha hai. Kya tum soye hue ke thodi der baad achanak gusse se chillate ho ya hilaate ho? Jaise ki, neend mein jaane ke baad kya hota hai ya thodi der baad?"
13,"after you go to sleep? I'm in the middle of the night he has. He said at first he thought I was joking around But, yeah, no, no, I am waking him up, you know. So",routine,97_13,P,id,,"Tu sone ke baad jaega? Mai rat ke beech me hun. Usne bola ki shuru me usko mazak kar rahi hun, par haan, nahi, nahi, mai use utha rahi hun, pata hai."
14,does that ever happen when you take like a nap for a short nap?,routine,97_14,T,yq,,kya kabhi aisa hota hai jab tum choti choti neend lete ho?
15,No.,routine,97_15,P,on,,Nahi.
16,Not that I know,routine,97_16,T,gc,,Mujhe utna pata nahi hai
17,"that he's, he's usually around electronic cash snapping he says it hasn't happened and so. Alright.",routine,97_17,P,gc,,"वह कहता है कि, वह आम तौर पर इलेक्ट्रॉनिक नकदी के आसपास घुमता है और वह कहत"
18,"So only at night when you're sleeping overnight and in the middle of that sleep. All right, would you be okay with sign a release so I can communicate with your question. ",routine,97_18,T,crq,,"Sirf raat ko jab aap raat bhar so rahe hote hai aur us bich mein. Theek hai, kya aapko koi dikkat nahi hogi agar main aapke sawaal se baat kar sakun?"
19,Yeah.,routine,97_19,P,op,,Haan.
20,And do you want your husband to be part of the counseling?,routine,97_20,T,yq,,Aur kya tum chahti ho ki tumhare pati bhi counseling ka hissa banenge?
21,"Yeah, that would probably be helpful for him to kind of get this side of things too.",routine,97_21,P,id,,"जी हां, उसके लिए यह होना सहायक होगा कि वह इस तरफ के बारे में भी समझ पाए।"
22,And you'd be okay saying release for him?,routine,97_22,T,yq,,Aur kya tum theek kehoge uske liye release?
23,"Yes, yes.",routine,97_23,P,op,,"Haan, haan."
24,So I'll get you scheduled into see a counselor. I appreciate you tell me what's going on. ,routine,97_24,T,gt,,Mai aapko ek counselor se milne ke liye schedule kar dunga. Mujhe aap bata sakte hain ki kya ho raha hai.
