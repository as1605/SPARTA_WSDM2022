Mai school mein hoon aur tests ki taiyaari kar raha hoon, mujhe bahut darr lag raha hai. Jab mai test leta hoon, mai bohot saari jaankari janta hoon par jab mai test leta hoon, mujhe yaad nahi rehta kyunki mujhe is test se bohot ghabrahat hoti hai, chahe kitna bhi information ho."
6,was anything physical thought there?,routine,191_6,T,irq,,Kya kuchh physical cheez waha socha gaya tha?
7,"Yeah, I think it's a lot of thoughts in my head and it is very physical. I mean, I get sweaty, I get sweaty palms, my heart starts racing, you know, I get tense. So it's it is physical. so Yeah, ",symp/reasoning,191_7,P,id,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki mere dimaag mein bahut saare khayal hain aur yeh bohot physical hai. Matlab, mujhe pasina aata hai, meri hatheliyaan garm ho jaati hain, mera dil tezi se dhadakta hai, pata hai, main tanavgrast ho jaata hoon. Toh yeh physical hai. Toh haan,"
8,Do you remember what thoughts going on?,routine,191_8,T,irq,,Kya tum yaad rakhte ho ki kya vichaar chal rahen hain?
9,"Um, my thoughts are like, I'm in the car. I'm gonna get hit. If I'm taking a test, it's like, Okay, I gotta do well on this test. I gotta remember this, there's so much to remember, and I just kind of brings freezing a little bit and I'm panicking because I can't remember. So I guess. So have you found that? No problem, which was not being able to complete the task?",story,191_9,P,id,,"Sorry, I'm in the car right now and I can't concentrate. If I'm giving a test, I'm like, Oh, I have to do great on it. There's so much to remember and I just start freezing up and panicking because I can't remember. So yeah, have you ever experienced that? No issues with not being able to finish a task?"
10,Four is it worth once you go through?,routine,191_10,T,irq,,Char par yeh jaane ki kya yeh layak hai?
11,"Um, is it like anxiety over when I finished the test? Yeah, yeah, after I'm finished. I mean, I know I could do perform better if I was going because I knew it wouldn't take me as long if I wasn't anxious. Um, it seems to me like time tests and so when it's over, whether it's an hour or two hours or however long it is, maybe it's over. You know, I'm anxious during it but when it's over. Yeah, it kind of subsides just like in car Like when I get to the place after I'm off the interstate and stuff, it seemed to subside. So when the situation is over, it seems to seems to go down. ",symp/reasoning,191_11,P,id,,"Um, kya anxiety ke liye hai jab maine test khatm kiya? Haan, haan, jab main khatm ho jaun. Main manta hoon ki agar mujhe jaana hua hota toh main zyada acha perform kar sakta tha, kyunki mujhe pata tha ki zyada waqt nahi lagta. Um, mujhe lagta hai ke time tests ke bina jab bhi khatm ho jata hai, chahe wo ek ghanta ho ya do ghante ya jitna bhi ho, tab woh khatm ho jata hai. Pata hai, jo wo mujhe anxiety deta hai madhur karke jab bhi khatm ho jata hai. Haan, woh thoda kam ho jata hai, just like car mein, jab main highway se utar kar jagah par pahunchta hoon, tab wo kam ho jata hai. Toh jab situation khatm ho jata hai, tab wo kam ho jata hai."
12,So sounds like you might need to find something that helps.,routine,191_12,T,od,,Toh aisa lag raha hai ki aapko kisi chiz ka pata karna hai jo madad kare.
13,"Yeah, I also think that the time, tell me in the moment because these are things that I mean, I can't avoid. I mean, even in my job to I've got to go my field placement. I've got to do these group settings, you know, I've got to do, and kids are crazy. They're disrespectful, like, Okay, I got to do it, though. So all these things I have to do. I can't change them and my wife right now, so got to figure out how to deal with it better.",symp/reasoning,191_13,P,ack,,"Haan, mujhe bhi lagta hai ki samay, mujhe abhi batao kyunki ye cheezein hain jo mere paas hain, main unse bach nahi sakta. Mera kaam mein bhi mujhe apni field placement mein jaana padta hai. Mujhe ye group settings, tu jaane, mujhe karna padta hai aur bachche paagal hain. Woh anadar pesh aate hain, thik hai, main karna padta hai. Toh inn saari cheezein mujhe karni padti hain. Main unhe badl nahi sakta aur meri biwi abhi mere paas nahi hai, isliye ab samajhna hoga unse kaise niptaaon."
14,Would you like to describe that?,routine,191_14,T,irq,,Kya tum usko bayan karna pasand karoge?
15,"yeah, I'm very eager to learn something that can make a difference.",symp/reasoning,191_15,P,id,,"Haan, main bahut utsuk hoon kuch aisa seekhne ke liye jo farq paida kar sake."
16,"Well, there's something called grounding do you know?",routine,191_16,T,crq,,"Arrey, kuch toh cheese ha jisse grounding kehte ha, kya tu janta ha?"
17,"No just lectricity grounding, you know that third floor thing, that's only grounding I know. I need to be grounded. That sounds good. Bring it on",symp/reasoning,191_17,P,on,,"Ab sirf electricity grounding nahi, tumhe pata hai na woh teesre manzil wala chiz, woh hi toh grounding hai jisko main jaanta hun. Mujhe shaant hona chahiye. Yeh toh badiya lagta hai. Shuru karo isko."
18,"So with grounding, a lot of people have a lot of emotions, okay to have emotions, but for some people, it gets really intense like, a lot and no one wants to bring that down to more of a calm place. So it doesn't necessarily solve the problem like there's still traffic. Yeah, nothing's going on, which just helps you get to a place to deal with",routine,191_18,T,cd,,"Toh grounding ke saath, bahut saare logon ko bahut saari emotions hoti hai, emotions hona theek hai, lekin kuch logon ke liye ye bahut tez ho jaata hai jaise, bahut zyada aur kisi ko bhi pasand nahi hai ki wo saari baatein shaant aur shaant jagah par leke jaaye. Toh woh problem ka solution nahi hai jaise ki traffic hai toh koi bhi solution nahi milta. Haan, kuch nahi ho raha hai, lekin wo sirf tumhe ek shaant jagah tak pahunchane me madad karta hai."
19,That sounds good.,inactive,191_19,P,gc,,वह सुनहरा द
20,"So I'm going to introduce a grounding technique to you, okay, and involves some deeper events in closing the eyes and getting to your senses. Okay, so I have a little script. Okay",routine,191_20,T,gc,,"Toh main tumhare liye ek grounding technique introduce karne jaa raha hu, theek hai, aur yeh kuch gehri gaathayein band aankhon aur apni indriyon par dyan dete hue hai.

And so for that I want you to, close your eyes, I want You to listen to my voice read my instructions So let's begin to relax by just noticing all the sounds around to start with. ",routine,191_24,T,gc,,"Lekin kisi ne mujhe diya hai mujhe bas yeh pata karna hai ki aap thoda sukoon se ho, aaraam se rest kar rahe ho, haath aapki taraf rakhe huye jaise bhi aap comfortable hai kaam kar raha hai bahut accha.

35,"mean, I might have noticed some of it but I'm obviously more aware because I'm really focusing on it right now. So I'm more aware of it right now.",symp/reasoning,191_35,P,id,,"Mera matlab hai, mujhe shayad kuch pata chala ho lekin mujhe is baare mein zyada pata hai kyunki main ab is par zor de raha hoon. Isliye ab main us par zyada dhyaan de raha hoon."
36,"And so maxwidth taste Notice I can just tell you some other situation you can take the time to like snack or something. Talk about the taste the texture. Well, it's totally the food and feel.

42,And then finally we'll touch on science. So when you hands on right now?,routine,191_42,T,irq,,Aur phir ham aakhir me aage science par cherege. Toh abhi jab haath se kar rahe ho?
43,I've had this kind of a habit of mine to kind of  feel my hands. My hands are supposed to be here,symp/reasoning,191_43,P,id,,Mere paas yeh aadat hai ki main apne haathon ko feel karne ka ek tarah ka habit rakhti hoon. Mere haath yahan hone chahiye.

And so I was kind of revved up, and then I kind of forgot about it, because I was focusing on you know, what I was seeing and what I was feeling and when I was, you know, all my senses of so it was very distracting. Damon a good way I got my mind off of that, and kind of got me on to something else. And then, yeah, they really did cut me down.",symp/reasoning,191_47,P,id,,"Arre waah, haye, ee toh kafi shaant kar diya tha mera dimaag. Matlab, mein toh thoda bechain ho rahi thi jab tumhe bata rahi thi ki mujhe kya bayaan karne se dar lagta hai. Aur tab toh mein kuch zyada hi mast ho gayi thi, fir bhul hi gayi usko kyunki tumpe dhyaan lagaa rahi thi, chaahe mein kuch bhi dekh rahi ho aur kaisa mehsoos kar rahi ho, mere paanch indriyon mein sab distracted tha. Par Damon ne ek achha tarike se meri madad ki, aur mujhe kuch aur sochne par majboor kar diya. Aur phir bhi, haan, woh mujhe sahi salaamat hawaale kar gaye."
48,Was there a certain sense that you weren't most help?,routine,191_48,T,irq,,क्या आपको कोई ऐसा अनुभव था जिसमें आपकी सबस

Yeah, that feeling too.",symp/reasoning,191_49,P,id,,"Yahan par pareshani ho rahi hai kyunki main khaa toh nahi rahi hoon? Shayad jo main dekh rahi hoon aur jo main sun rahi hoon, woh do cheezein is situation mein sabse zyada kaam aayegi. Haan, woh ehsaas bhi."
50,"So let's talk about how we can use this because obviously can't close your eyes, right? ",routine,191_50,T,orq,,"Toh chalo hum baat karte hai ki hum iska istemaal kaise kar sakte hai kyunki aap obviously aankhein toh band nahi kar sakte, sahi hai na?"

Kabhi mujhe nicha nahi bulaana chahiye, kabhi kabhi mai bahut tension mein ho sakta hu. Shayad mujhe kuch pyaari si music sunna chahiye jisse mai shaant ho jaun. Koi aisi cheez jo mujhe shaant karde."
56,"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,191_56,T,ack,,"Ab bhai, ab bhai."
57,"Yeah, yeah, I think the music might be more because not that I want to be distracted from the cars. But I think my music might call me down more than having nothing, you know, like, quiet and hearing the cars growth might I can see That might make me nervous. I need to be aware of them. But I think I want to hear music. So I'll try that. Yeah.",symp/reasoning,191_57,P,id,,"Yeah, yeah, mujhe lagta hai ki music zyada ho sakta hai kyunki main gaadiyon se dhyaan hatana nahi chahta.

But I got to focus on and seen as paying attention to the words on the front of me.",symp/reasoning,191_61,P,id,,"Thek, jab mai definitely dekh raha hu, tab mujhe focus karna chahiye kyunki mai kuch padh raha hu aur mujhe computer par mera dhyan zyada lagna hai.

Toh agli baar jab aap census mein tap karna chahe, theek hai? Agar aap sirf paanch minute ka break lena chahe aur har ek sense ke liye ek minute chahiye, theek hai, jaise ki test shuru karne se pehle ya gadi chalane se pehle. Okay, theek hai, us tarah se kar sakte hain."
