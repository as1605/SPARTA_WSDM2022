6,What happened?,inactive,92_6,T,irq,0.0,Kya hua?
7,"yeah, so about two weeks ago, I was finishing up this wonderful machine that I was creating in my room, so that the government can't hear my thoughts or my, my actions or my behaviors. And I was just trying to finish up my last little bit that I needed to build and I went over to the neighbor, because their garage was open and just picked out a tool and brought it back to the house. And when I was in the house working on my my room, the cops came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. So it's like, see the government data to get",story,92_7,P,id,-2.0,"Haan, toh do hafte pehle, main apne kamre mein bana raha tha ek shandar machine jo ki maine bayaan kiya tha aur government meri soch ya meri harkaton ya meri banawatiyat ko na sun paye. Aur main taiyari kar raha tha apne akhri chhote se hisse ko banaane ka aur mujhe ek tool ki zaroorat thi jiska mahsool main apne pados mein khul ke gaya aur use gharaaya aur ghar laaya. Aur jab main apne kamre par kaam kar raha tha, police aake mujhe utha kar hospital le gayi. Toh yeh toh hai ki government data ko hasil karna padega."
8,what you think the government is trying to do.,routine,92_8,T,irq,0.0,Tumko lagta hai sarkar kya karne ki koshish kar rahi hai.
9,"They're trying to stop me from actually creating my room. Because they're, they're creating this new order where they want everybody to follow them. And I'm not a follower. And I know what I want. And I know what I need. And I know what my family wants, and I know what they need. And I'm just trying to protect them by creating my room.",story,92_9,P,id,-1.0,"Voh meri room banaane se rokne ki koshish mein hai. Kyunki woh log, woh ek naya order bana rahe hain jahaan woh chahte hain ki sab unke pairon pe chale. Main ek anuyaayi nahi hoon. Mujhe pata hai mera kya chahiye aur kya zaroorat hai. Meri family ko kya chahiye aur unhein kya zaroorat hai, woh bhi mujhe pata hai. Aur main bas unhein bachaane ki koshish kar raha hoon apni room banaakar."
10,And tell me about your room. What what are you doing there that makes that special.,routine,92_10,T,ci,0.0,Aur mujhe apne kamre ke baare mein batao. Kya wohi cheez hai jo tum wahan kar rahe ho jo usko khaas banati hai?
11,So I was smart enough to know that there are frequencies and waves that are out there that the government is actually sending you through the lights and also through the TV and like through every electronic apparatus that is out there. And I'm actually creating doll or a wave neutralizer so that it can actually stop that from happening. So that you can actually live the life that you want and be happy and youthful and joyful all the time.,story,92_11,P,id,0.0,So maine ye samajh liya ki frequencies aur waves bahar maujood hain jinse sarkar aapko roshniyon ke zariye aur TV ke zariye aur har electronic upkaran ke zariye bhejti hai. Aur main ek doll ya wave neutralizer bana raha hoon jisse wo ghatna rok sakte hain. Taki aap jaise chahe jeevan ji saken aur hamesha khush aur jawan aur khush rah saken.
12,Is that how you were feeling when you were building?,routine,92_12,T,yq,0.0,Kya tumhe aise mehsoos ho raha tha jab tum banane mein busy the?
13,"Yeah, because I created this prototype in my room. And anytime I'm basically in there I was, it was good. I had energy. I didn't have everything that I wanted. But my prototype was running out of fuel. And so I needed to make it bigger, larger, so it can run longer.",story,92_13,P,op,0.0,"Haan, kyunki maine apne kamre mein yeh prototype banaya tha. Aur kisi bhi waqt main vahan basically tha, tab yeh bahut acha tha. Mujhe energy mili thi. Mujhe sab kuchh nahi tha jo main chahata tha. Lekin meri tarah ki prototype ka fuel khatam ho raha tha. Isliye mujhe use bada, badiya banana tha taaki wo lamba daud pa sake."
14,That's what you're trying to do,routine,92_14,T,crq,0.0,Ye wo hai jo tum karne ki koshish kar rahe ho
15,"Yeah, that's what I was trying to do when I wouldn't borrowed the tools from my neighbor but yeah, and then also I was ordering some things that were online. And they were also supposed to become be shipped in so that the base piece that I was creating, that I use the tools for my neighbor's house. It could have been all perfect and set so that when All of the hard drives in the electrical wiring and all of that stuff came in, I could just plug it in. And then not only my room covered, but also my houses covered and all of my family, they could just be happy.",story,92_15,P,cd,1.0,"Haan, vohi mai koshish kar raha tha jab maine apne padosi se tools bhar liye the, par haan, fir mai kuch cheezein online order kar raha tha. Aur voh bhi bas shipping ho jaane wali the, taaki main jo base piece bana raha tha, jisme maine apne padosi ke tools ka istemaal kiya tha, sab perfect ho jaaye. Taki jab saari hard drives aur electrical wiring aaye, mai bas unhe plug kar saku. Fir na sirf meri hi kamra, balki meri puri gharwali aur meri poori family, sab khush ho jaaye."
16,"They could be happy, they could be happy, like, you know, you were happy.",story,92_16,T,crq,0.0,"Vo could ho happy, vo could ho happy, jaise, tu maan liyo, tum khush tha."
17,"I was happy, like, so two weeks ago, I was I was good. I, I was up, I did all the calculations that I need to create. So I can actually build my base in my system. But then I also did the calculations about the different types of waves being in the house, but then also out of the house, that I also had the opportunity to just not sleep because I need sleep. I wasn't tired. And if I did sleep, I slept for like 15 minutes, just because I needed to finish what I was going to do. And I was so close to finishing and my neighbour called cops.",story,92_17,P,cd,1.0,"Main khush tha, samajho, to do hafte pahle, main achha tha. Main, main khada ho gaya tha, maine woh saare hisaab kar lie jinhe maine banana jaruri tha. Isliye main actually apne system mein mera base banane mein saksham ho gaya. Lekin fir maine ghar mein aur ghar se bahar hone wale alag prakar ke tufano ke baare mein bhi hisaab kiye, jisse maine mauka paya ki main bas raat bhar na soke kyunki mujhe need thi. Main thaka nahi tha. Aur agar main soya toh sirf 15 minute ke liye, kyunki mujhe woh karna tha jo maine karna tha. Aur main usse khatam karne ke bahut kareeb tha jab meri padosi ne police ko bulaya."

29,"um, I think I ordered probably know the exact number I ordered 236 hard drives, because 236 is the perfect number that I needed to not only cover my bedroom, so I can always be happy and if the system went down, my room was always going to be covered. But then within that 236 it also covered my house so that my family could be happy, and like my four neighbors around us so we can all be happy.

Oh my god, I can use our credit card. So I was using our credit card because it's trying to make her happy. And so I don't know I added the 236. They were probably 50 to $100 apiece, depending on where it could get them and I just ordered them.",routine,92_33,P,id,0.0,"Main pata nahi.

54,summary,"The patient was building a machine in their room so that government cannot hear their thoughts, actions or behaviors. The cops came and took the patient to the hospital. The patient feels they are creating orders for everyone to follow and the patient is not a follower. The patient has ordered tools online and borrowed from neighbors to secure their entire house. The patient has been restless and does not sleep much, feels very good and energetic. The patient neither feels happy nor sad, somewhere in the middle. The patient had ordered 236 hard drives, to form a grid to protect theirs and their neighbor's homes. It was bought with mom's credit card at 50 to 100$ a piece. The patient and their mom interact minimally and that is normal according to the patient. The patient feels they have to complete the machine. The patient is paranoid about the government and do not wish to be controlled by them. The therapist requests the patient to continue seeing a counselor. ",,,,,
