I can't do it anymore.",symp/reasoning,4_5,P,id,,"Haan, lagta hai last eight mahine se, shayad ek saal bhi, pata hai, mujhe office mein yeh position di gayi hai jahaan mujhe hafte bhar ke presentations banana padte hain aur, aur yeh mujhe maar daal rahi hai. Ab aur nahi kar sakti."
6,Tell me about how these presentations are set up.,routine,4_6,T,crq,,Mujhe batao ki yeh presentations kis tarah se set up kiye jaate hain.
7,"So it's a it's, it's the executive director and it's 10 managers, we're kind of sitting in a circle and everybody goes around and does like a weekly program update. Five minutes or so maybe 10. At the most if there's an issue that kind of needs to be adjusted. And but everybody takes turns speaking and it goes around kind of around in a circle. And you know, depending on where you said is what order you present and basically",story,4_7,P,cd,,"Toh yeh hai ek hai ek, yeh hai executive director aur yeh hai 10 managers, hum circle mein baith ke weekly program ka update karte hain. Lagbhag paanch minute ya 10 minute tak, maximum agar koi issue resolve karna ho. Par har koi apni baari par bolta hai aur circle mein ghoomte ghoomte baat karte hain. Aur jaise jaise aapne kaha, uss order mein presentation hoti hai aur basic taur par."
8,and you say that this situation the presentation you said it's killing you.,routine,4_8,T,crq,,"Aur tum kehte ho ki yeh haalat jo tumne kaha hai, woh tumhe maar rahi hai."

10,would feeling so you have,inactive,4_10,T,crq,,Kya tumhe aisa lag raha hai ki tumhare paas hai?
11,"I feel like it's constantly on my mind and constantly worried about this presentation. And even though I only have to speak for like five minutes, I'm so consumed by by this part of my job that I can't I can't do anything else and I normally feel like I do good in my job but but this and, you know, it just, it builds up more like every day the day before is is really bad because I'm prepping for the meeting. And so it really starts to consume me then I don't sleep the night before. And then by the time you know, I get to the meeting I'm, I'm so anxious and so nervous, I'm panicking and everything, and I just can't. I just can't.",story,4_11,P,cd,,"Mere dil mein hamesha yeh baat rehti hai aur main iss presentation se hamesha pareshan rehti hoon. Aur chahe main kewal paanch minute ke liye hi bolna ho, lekin yeh mere kaam ke iss hisse se itna taqleef de ta hai ki main kuch aur nahi kar paati aur aksar main apne kaam mein accha karti hoon, lekin iss baat ka itna zyada asar hota hai ki har din pehle ki hi tarah badhta hai. Isliye woh din bohot mushkil ho jaata hai kyunki woh meeting ki taiyaari karne mein laga rehta hai. Aur isi tarah yeh mere andar dheere dheere samaa jaata hai aur main raat ko neend nahi aane deti. Aur phir jab meeting ka waqt aata hai, main bohot zyada pareshan aur ghabraati hoon, har cheez mein panic ho jaati hoon. Lekin phir bhi, main nahi kar paati. Bas nahi kar paati."
12,"So, so this is this is distressing for you.",routine,4_12,T,orq,,"Arey, arey, ye ye toh ye ye tumhare liye dukhdayak hai."
13,"And this is probably difficult to, to talk about the beginning of the meeting what would be your anxiety level what's going on then?",routine,4_13,T,orq,,"Aur yeh shayad kathin hoga, shuruwat ke baare mein baat karna, aapke anxiety level kya hoga, aur kya ho raha hai tab?"
14,"By the beginning of the meeting, when I've sat down, I'm, I'm, I feel like I'm breathing harder. I'm starting to sweat. And I feel like my face is turning red. My palms are really sweaty and costly having to wipe them off on my pants. I My heart is racing. And I feel like you know, the closer it gets to being my turn, I feel like everything just gets worse. I feel like I'm breathing harder and my heart is beating faster and louder. I feel like everybody can hear it. My stomach just gets in knots, I feel nauseous. And I can't, you know, there have been times that I've managed to like just hold my hand still, and just sit really still. And I've tried some deep breathing and just satin and have made it through. And I have have made it to my, my presentation and and been able to speak but even then when I speak, I stutter and I stammer over my words, and I don't say everything I need to even I have a cheat sheet essentially. And I can reframe it. I still feel like I'm missing things and I'm leaving things out and my voice doesn't project so I end up speaking very softly and like I said, I'm stuttering, I just can't get it. Even then, it's it's still I feel like it's still a mess.",story,4_14,P,od,,"Meeting ki shuruaat tak, jab mein baith jaati hoon, mujhe lagta hai ki main zyada saans le rahi hoon. Main paseena chhoot rahi hoon. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki mera chehra laal ho raha hai. Mere haath ganthe ban gaye hain, main hi pad par unhe ponchti rehti hoon. Mera dil tezi se dhadak raha hai. Aur jab mera baari aati hai, mujhe aisa lagta hai ki sab kuch behatar ho jaata hai. Main zyada saans le rahi hoon aur mera dil tezi se dhadak raha hai aur zor zor se. Mere pet mein ghabrahat hoti hai, mujhe udaasi mehsoos hoti hai. Aur kabhi-kabhi mein apne haath ko sambhal kar baith jaati hoon aur gehri saans lekar rukti hoon. Lekin phir bhi mere hont hilte hain, aur main apne shabdon mein ghulti hoon, aur main jo bhi bolna chahti hun wo nahi bol paati hun, chahe mere paas cheat sheet ho ya na ho. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki mera awaaz bhi nahi nikal raha hai, isliye main bahut kam volume mein bol rahi hun, aur dohrapan bhi hai. Ismein bhi kuch gadbad hai."
15,"You're not you're not happy with the quality of your prison. Now even even when you're able to kind of stay there and conducted, so I want to divide this into the stages. So we talked about the very beginning. So you're already having anxieties sounds like it's fairly intense at that point. Tell me about as they go around the table and give their brief presentations. Tell me about what you're feeling as, as the presentations come around to you.",story,4_15,T,irq,,"Tum tum satisfied nahi ho apni jail ke quality se. Ab tum wahan rehne aur kaam karne ke liye capable ho, to main isko stages mei bantna chahta hun. Ise hum shuruat se panktiyon mei baat kar chuke hain. Tum shuru se hi preshan lag rahe ho, itna intense lagta hai. Mujhe tumhare table ke aas paas ghumte hue, aur unki alag alag presentations sunte hue, tum kya feel kar rahe ho, jab tumhari baari aati hai?"
16,"Well, if I if I manage somehow to get there early enough, and I can get an early enough seat like to sit like right next to my boss, or like, like one or two away, then I'm actually pretty okay. Because I can, I can kind of get it over and done. But so many times I'm so nervous and honestly, a bit hungover because I've been drinking too to try and I don't feel anxious want to drink. So there have been a lot of times that I've I've woken up a little bit late because I've been drinking. And so by the time I get there, like one of the last, it's one of the last seats, so I'm one of the last to go. And so as it gets closer and closer to me, I just feel more and more anxious and panicky. And here in, especially in the last few weeks, I've had to leave, I can say, I've got to go.",story,4_16,P,id,,"Achha, agar mujhe jaldi pahunchne mein kuch tarah se kamyab ho jaati hai, aur main jaldi se kaafi jaldi ek seat mil jaati hai, toh mere boss ke paas right next ya fir ek do jagah par baithna pasand karta hoon, kyunki fir main kafi theek ho jata hoon. Kyunki main turant kaam khatam kar leta hoon. Lekin kai baar main badi nervous rehta hoon aur frankly, thodi chadhi hui hu kyunki main ne zyada peene ki koshish ki hai, mujhe taaki mujhe nervous na ho. Bohot baar aisa hua hai ki main thodi late utha hu kyunki maine peena shuru kar diya hai. Aur jab main yaan tak pahunchta hoon, toh wahan pe kafi seats khali ho jati hai. Main akhri mein jaana-padta hai. Aur jab itna kareeb aata hai, toh main aur zyada nervous aur panic feel karta hoon. Aur yaha par, khaas taur par last kuch hafto mein, mujhe jaana padega, main bol sakta hoon, mujhe jaana padega."
17,"So before before the presentations come around to you, you get up and yeah, leave the room. So in those times when you've stayed in the room and you've done the presentation, so the anxiety, the anxiety, the panic, the heart rate, sweaty palms, all these symptoms are increasing as they go around the table or the room and when it comes to you actually giving your presentation. You're not happy with that but what strings it level like during your presentation.",story,4_17,T,crq,,"Toh jab presentations tere pass aati hai, tab tak tu uthar jaata hai aur haan, kamre se chala jaata hai. Aise samay mein, jab tu kamre mein hi rehta hai aur presentation kar deta hai, tab ghabraahat, panic, dil ki dhadkan, aur garm haathon jaise sab lakshan table ya kamre ke aas paas badte rehte hain aur jab tere paas presentation dena hota hai. Tu usse khush nahi hai, par jab tum presentation dete ho toh uss waqt kaisa hota hai?"
18,"I feel like during the presentation, I feel almost like everything. So everything stops. And then and then when it's done, and it goes to whoever's next. It's like, it's almost like a physical sense of relief. Like, okay, that's over and everything starts to relax and calm down, but then I feel miserable. I am so, so upset with how I performed that, that more than anybody else that that might that will really that everybody is like, What is wrong with her, but that my boss especially is like, why did I give her this job again, and I feel so so miserable, that that I've I feel like I've disappointed him and I've so I've disappointed me. And I mean, this has always, always happened to me. For as long as I can remember, I've never been able to speak in front of groups and you know, from back in college. If I had to make a presentation, I would ask the teacher if there's a way out of it. And if they refuse, then I wouldn't present. And I had a teacher who insisted that I make the presentation, and I dropped the class and I took it again, with a different teacher that wouldn't make me present because I couldn't do it. And High School is the same that I would, you know, I just wouldn't do it. And actually, this is ridiculous. You know, I mentioned drinking. I've been drinking for a really long time. When I was like, I don't know like, 13 or 14, I got busted for underage drinking and I had to do some, like adolescent treatment and I had to do this like group therapy with these other kids and I couldn't do that i bolted out of the room and so never been able to do this ever.",story,4_18,P,cd,,"Mujhe feels hota hai ki during the presentation, mujhe lagta hai ki almost sab kuch hota hai. Toh sab kuch ruk jata hai. Fir jab ho jata hai, aur kisi aur ka turn hota hai. Toh woh almost ek physical sense of relief hota hai. Like, thik hai, ab wo sab khatm ho gaya aur sab shant ho jata hai, par phir mujhe dard hota hai. Main itna upset hoon, apni performance se, jyada kisi aur se, jisme sab log mujhse puch rahe hai, ""Uska kya problem hai?"" Aur meri boss toh especially, bhala tumhe firse ye job kyu diya, mujhe bahut bahut dukh hota hai, kyunki mujhe lagta hai ki maine uski expectations ko poori nahi kiya aur meri khud ki bhi expectations ko nahi poora kiya. Aur yeh hamesha mere saath hota hai. Jab se main yaad kar sakti hoon, main kabhi bhi groups ke samne bhaashan nahin de payi hoon, aur wapas college se. Agar mujhe presentation dena ho, toh main teacher se puchungi ki kya koi dusra tarika hai. Aur agar woh mana kare, toh main presentation nahi dungi. Aur high school mein bhi same tha, main kar hi nahi paati thi. Aur actually, yeh toh afsos ki baat hai. Main ne drinking ke baare mein bhi bathaya. Main bahut time se drinking kar rahi hoon. Jab main 13 ya 14 ki thi, toh mujhe pakad liya gaya underage drinking ke liye aur mujhe kuch treatment karna pada, aur group therapy karna pada, un dusre bachchon ke saath, par main wo nahin kar paayi, main uchal ke bahar aa gayi. Aur iss kaaran se kabhi bhi main wo kar hi nahi paayi."
19,"See if you've had these symptoms for a long time, they've been frustrating you for a long time have a period of time where you haven't had to be in front of other people.",story,4_19,T,orq,,"Dekho agar tumhe yeh symptoms bht time se ho rahe hai, jo tumhe bht time se pareshan kar rahe hai, to ek samay ka period ho jaha tumhe dusre logon ke samne nahi rehna pada ho."
20,"Um, well if I haven't had to be in front of other people I've been I've been kind of okay you know, I can go to the movies but I like to sit on yet and you know, I can go out with with my family and my friends and we can go shopping but I don't like to go to new places. I like to go kind of like the same places that have familiar Yeah, yeah. Cuz because I know them. You know, I know The layout of stores and things like that.",story,4_20,P,od,,"Arre yaar, agar mujhe logon ke samne nahi rehna padta toh main kaafi theek hoon, pata hai na. Main movies dekhne ja sakta hoon lekin mujhe floor par baitna pasand hai aur pata hai, main apne family aur friends ke saath ghoom sakti hoon aur shopping kar sakti hoon lekin main naye jagah nahi jaana chahti. Main wohi jagah prefer karti hoon jo mujhe familiar hai. Kyunki main unhe jaanti hoon na, stores aur cheezein ka layout pata hai mujhe."
21,"So it interferes with your functioning. Maybe a little bit. But if you're not having to present, it's not as big a deal as it is now for you. Yes job. ",story,4_21,T,crq,,"So ye aapke functioning ko interfere karta hai. Shayad thoda sa. Lekin agar aapko present karne ki zarurat nahi hai, to ye ab aapke liye itna bada masla nahi hai. Haan naukri."
22,"Yes, ",inactive,4_22,P,cd,,"haan,"
23,"it's really affecting it. So are you taking any measures? Or have you take any measures other than drinking, you mentioned, to avoid a situation to avoid?",routine,4_23,T,crq,,"ye kafi asar daal rha hai. to kya aap koi kadam utha rhe hai? ya peene ke alawa koi aur kadam liya hai, jiska zikr aapne kia hai, taa ki hum is ke saath bach saken?"
24,"Oh, definitely. I mean, there's like I said, I mean, I've run out of the meetings. There's been times that I've called in sick when I haven't been there's been times when I've, I've said I've had car trouble arrived so late that it was unreasonable to make my presentation. I've actually talked to my boss about possibly not doing the presentation and just giving my notes to him or to brief him before after and because I have to say that I have this problem. I mean, Normal people don't do this, right? I mean, normal people can make these presents, like the rest of the staff can do it, why can't I? And so I don't want to tell him that, you know, I that there's something wrong with me. I mean, it's, it's gotten to the point that I've talked to him about, you know, this other position that's in another department and transferring so that I wouldn't have to do this anymore. And and it would it would be a pay cut. I mean, it's a demotion but I can't live like this.",story,4_24,P,cd,,"Haan, pakka. Main toh kahaan tha, matlab, main meetings se baahar nikal jaa raha tha. Kaai baar main bimaar hone ka natak kar ke chutti ya haalaat ki wajah se late pahunch chuka hoon, jiska koi matlab nahi tha. Main apni presentation dekar ke liye late pahuncha, jo poori tareh aakalmandi se seemit ho gaya tha. Main apne boss se baat karta tha ke kya main is presentation ko nahi kar sakta aur sirf apne notes de sakta hoon ya usse baad mein brief kar sakta hoon. Kyunki mujhe is samasya ka saamna karna pad raha hai. Matlab, normal log toh aisa nahi karte, na? Normal log presentation dete hain, baaki ke staff bhi waise hi karte hain, toh main kyun nahi kar sakta? Isliye main use yeh nahi batana chahta ki mujhe kuchh na kuchh gadbad hai. Yeh haalat itni kharab hogayi hai ki maine usse ek aur department mein dusre position ki baat ki hai, jisse main yeh kaam na karna pade. Aur haan, uss position ka salary cut ho jaayega. Matlab, yeh toh regression ho jaayega par mujhse yeh sab nahi ho payega."
25," This is too painful. If you had the other job, his other job would involve presentations. So you'd be happier. You'd have fewer symptoms in that job. What's been the result of that discussion? Has there been anything has happened as far as well.",routine,4_25,T,orq,,"Yeh bahut dukhad hai. Agar tumhe dusra naukri hota, toh uska kaam presentation shamil hona hoga. Toh tum khush rahoge. Us job mein tumhe kam lakshan honge. Us charcha ka kya parinam hua? Kya kuch hua hai iske alawa?"
26,He has told me that he thinks something In a good job,routine,4_26,P,od,,He has bataya mujhe ki woh kuch sochta hai ek achi naukri mein.
27,"excuse me, and he doesn't want me to. Here's what I'm going to change positions. But I can't, I can't do this anymore.",routine,4_27,P,od,,"Maafi, aur usko yeh nahi chahiye ki main kuchh badhaalu. Yahan tak main apni jagah badalne ki koshish karungi. Lekin main nahi kar sakti, main aise aur nahi kar sakti."
28,"All right, so you've you've tried, you try to cope with anxiety. You've had to leave colon, colon sick or come in late. You've looked for different position or doesn't involve presenting. You've had this problem in other circumstances, the group therapy and in presentations before",routine,4_28,T,gc,,"Alright, toh tu ne try kiya hai, tu cope karne ki anxiety se. Tu ko chodhna padha hai colon, colon beemar ho ya late aane ki wajah se. Tu ne alag-alag position ki khoj ki ya jisme presenting na ho. Tu ne ye problem dusre mauke mein bhi face ki hai, group therapy aur presentation mein pehle se."
29,Do you or have you seen any symptoms like this and your parents?,routine,4_29,T,yq,,Kya apko ya kisi ki maa-baap ne aise lakshan dekhe hai?
30,"Yeah, both of my parents and my sister actually. We were kind of joke about it. Some times that we all get so nervous. And my sister, I don't know how but she managed to find a job where she doesn't interact with anybody.",story,4_30,P,ack,,"Ha, dono mere mummy-papa aur meri behen ne bhi. Hum bas mazaak mein iss baare mein baat karte hain. Kabhi kabhi hum sab itna nervous ho jaate hain. Aur meri behen ne kaise, mujhe nahi pata, lekin woh toh kisi se interaction nahi karti hai apni naukri mein."
31,"It's her in her office with our computer by herself. And it's just, it's just hurt. I don't know how she pulled it off. I mean, she doesn't. She hardly talks on the phone.",story,4_31,P,gc,,"Wo uski office me hai apne computer ke saath akeli. Aur, yeh bas, yeh dard de raha hai. Mujhe nahi pata ki usne kaise manage kiya. Matlab, wo toh karti hi nahi. Wo phone par bahut kam baat karti hai."
32,"And she's really happy and my parents they actually they they met in college. When my dad after my mom made a presentation, my dad, I guess, leaned over and was like, you know, I could tell you're really nervous, but today great and they just they seem to bond over this nervousness that they both had.",story,4_32,P,gc,,"And woh bahut khush hai aur mere mummy papa, sach mein, jab college mein mile. Jab meri mummy ne presentation di, tab mera papa, I guess, leaned over ke, tu bohot nervous lag rahi hai, par aaj tu bahut badiya hai aur un dono ko yeh nervousness se bond hone laga."
33,"Right? So there may be maybe a history, a family history of symptoms. like these, this distressing for you, you tried to avoid it and deal with it but you haven't been you don't feel you've been very successful coping with it.",routine,4_33,T,crq,,"Right? Toh shayad aapke paas ya phir aapki family mein iske lakshano ki ek puraani kahaani ho sakti hai. Aise hi, yeh aapke liye pareshaani ka kaaran hai, aapne isse bachne ki koshish ki hai aur isse deal karne ki koshish ki hai par aapko yeh samasya kaabu mein rakhne mein kaafi safal nahi lagta."
34,We'll get you in for treatment we'll catch in the next couple days to see a counselor. If that's what you'd like to do.,routine,4_34,T,orq,,"""Hum aapko ilaaj ke liye le jayenge, agli kuch dinon mein counsellor se milne ke liye pakad lenge. Agar aap yahi karna chahte hain to."""
35,"Yes, please ",inactive,4_35,P,cd,,"Haan, kripaya."
