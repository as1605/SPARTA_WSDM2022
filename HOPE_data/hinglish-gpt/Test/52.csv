1,Good? How are you?,inactive,52_1,P,gt,,ठीक है? तुम कैसे
2,I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.,inactive,52_2,T,gt,,मैं ठीक हूँ। धन्यवाद प
3,How has the anxiety been going?,symp/reasoning,52_3,T,irq,,Anxiety ka haal kaisa rah raha hai?
4,"Um, since last session, it seems to be in check.",symp/reasoning,52_4,P,id,,"उम, पिछले सत्र से दिखता है कि यह जाँच में है। (Um"
5,Nothing really major. It's been going on with it. So I think,routine,52_5,P,id,,Kuch badi baat nahi hai. Yeh uske saath chal raha hai. Isliye main sochta hoon.
6,I'm getting to a point where it's under control.,routine,52_6,P,id,,"""Mai ek point tak pahuch raha hu jahan sab theek ho raha hai."""
7,"I subsided a bit. That's good. Yeah, that's good. How's things been going at work lately?",routine,52_7,T,irq,,"Main thoda sant ho gaya. Accha hai. Haan, accha hai. Kaam mein haal hi mein kaisa chal raha hai?"
8,"So works a little bit of a different story. Um, we have our daily meetings, and I actually had to clean like one of my co workers aside because I feel like they undermine me all the time. And they like, they don't give me the respect basically, that I deserve. So I took her outside after the meeting and lean into her about it. And afterwards, I mean, the next day, because we have these things every day, and she like, she came back and came at me again. But it was worse, even after talking for",story,52_8,P,id,,"""Toh kaam kuch alag hi gul hai. Um, hamare daily meetings hain, aur main actually apni sah-karmiyon mein se ek ko saaf karna pada kyunki mujhe lagta hai ki wo hamesha mere kaam ko nazar andaz karte hain. Aur unko bilkul bhi izzat nahi dete. Isiliye maine meeting ke baad usse bula kar iss bare mein baat ki. Lekin agle din, kyunki hum roz kehte hain, usne phir se mere khilaf aakarshak baat ki. Lekin ye baar toh bohot buri thi, meine toh usse baat karna hi chod diya."""
9,no.,inactive,52_9,P,on,,Nahi.
10,"So you have these, someone understands you have these daily meetings? Right. And you mentioned that she's not showing you respect and that you deserve respect. Right? effect. So tell me, tell me about that. Believe from what we talked about ABC before activating events and beliefs and consequences. In our abt, tell me about that belief.",routine,52_10,T,irq,,"Toh tumhare paas yeh meetings hain, koi yeh samajh raha hai ki tumhare paas roz yeh meetings hote hain? Sahi. Aur tumne bataya ki wo tumko izzat nahi dikhata aur tumko izzat milni chahiye. Sahi? Toh batao, uske baare mein batao. Meri baat suno, meri us baare mein batao jo hum ABC ke baare mein baat kiye the, yaani activating events, beliefs aur consequences. Humare abt mein, us belief ke baare mein batao."
11,"Or I just feel that I do a good job and I deserve to be respected by my coworkers. Yeah, it just",routine,52_11,P,id,,"Yaar mujhe lagta hai ki main accha kaam karti hoon aur mere coworker mujhe sammaan dena chahiye. Haan, bas."
12,other levels of respect. There's a certain level of respect that you demand or need.,routine,52_12,T,orq,,दूसरे स्तरों का आदर। आपको एक ऐसे स्तर की आदर की जरूरत या आवश्यक
13,"I don't know if there's a certain level, but I feel just like, I deserve it. You know,",routine,52_13,P,od,,"Mujhe nahi pata ki ek nishchit level hai ya nahi, lekin mujhe aisa hi lagta hai ki mujhe iska yogya hoon. Samjhe na?"
14,and what did she do? That kind of convinced you that she wasn't meeting that level of respect?,routine,52_14,T,irq,,Aur wo kya karti thi? Waisa hi tumhe yakeen dilaya ki wo us samman ki hud se milne se bach rahi thi?
15,"Well, she was like, she doubt my ideas, um, and just kind of made me feel like a fool, basically. So I just I didn't understand.",story,52_15,P,id,,"Waise, wo aise hi thi, usne mere vichaaron par shak kiya, um, aur bas mujhe bewakoof jaisa mehsoos karwaya. Toh maine, main samajh nahi paya."
16,right,inactive,52_16,P,gc,,Sahi
17,"I mean, I guess.",inactive,52_17,P,gc,,"मैं मतलब, मुझे सम"
18,Have you criticized other coworkers?,routine,52_18,T,yq,,Kya tumne dusre co-workers ko criticism kiya hai?
19,yeah.,routine,52_19,P,ack,,haan.
20,So do you think that her criticism was within normal limits like within the what you've kind of seen there regularly,routine,52_20,T,irq,,Kya tumhe lagta hai ki uski criticism normal limits ke andar thi jaise ki tumne wahan aksar dekha hai?
21,"I mean, now that you pointed out I mean, I guess I can view it in that way that it wasn't.",routine,52_21,P,id,,"यानि, अब जब तुमने बताया कि यानि, मुझे लगता है मैं उसी तरह देख सकता हूँ कि वह नहीं था।"
22,it just felt like she was purposely trying to nitpick if you were,routine,52_22,P,id,,Yeh sirf aisa hi laga ki wo  jaanbhoojh kar tujhe kanta nit-pick karne ki koshish kar rahi thi.
23,Yeah.,routine,52_23,P,ack,,Haan.
24,"I mean, I guess I may have gone out or a little partially um, But I felt at the time that it was reasonable",routine,52_24,P,id,,"Mai manta hun, maine shayad thoda sa bahar ja saka ya thoda sa umeed par, lekin tab mujhe mahsoos hua ki yeh samajhne layak tha."
25,at the time when you were?,routine,52_25,T,irq,,Tum tab bhi the jab?
26,when I was talking to her outside of the meeting.,routine,52_26,P,id,,जब मैं मीटिंग के बाहर उससे बात कर रहा था।
27,"So you felt that she was a bit harsh. You talk to her about it, but then she's become more harsh. So where do you stand with her now? Like the meeting? Well,",routine,52_27,T,irq,,"Toh tujhe yeh lagaa ke woh thodi si zyada kadwi thi. Tu usse baat karta hai, par phir woh aur bhi kadwi ho gayi hai. Ab tere saath uski soch kya hai? Jaise naye vyaapaar ki mulaakaat? Achha, toh?"
28,"I've just been trying not to talk to her. And obviously, in a work situation, doesn't really help. ",routine,52_28,P,id,,"Main to bas usse baat na karne ki koshish kar raha tha. Aur obvious hai, kaam ki sthiti mein, yeh koi madad nahi karti."
29,It's not convenient. Yeah. It might not help. Alright. So let's work this through using the ABC model that we use for the anxiety that you had before. Right? That was troublesome to you before. What would the activating event be here in this situation?,routine,52_29,T,irq,,Yeh aasan nahi hai. Baat hai. Shayad isse kuch fayda na ho. Theek hai. Toh chalo hum is ABC model ki madad se kaam karenge jo aapke pehle ke chinta ka liye use karte hain. Theek hai? Woh aapko pareshan karti thi pehle. Is sthiti mein yahan prakritik ghatna kya hogi?
30,So I guess the confrontation I had whether,routine,52_30,P,id,,Toh main samajhta hun ki mujhe jo takraar hui thi wo kya thi
31,Was this criticism?,routine,52_31,T,yq,,Kya yeh criticism hai?
32,Yeah. Yeah.,routine,52_32,P,ack,,Haan. Haan.
33,So She criticized me and I felt disrespected.,routine,52_33,P,id,,Toh usne mujhe criticize kiya aur maine insulted feel kiya.
34,That's a feeling,routine,52_34,T,orq,,Yeh ek anubhav hai.
35,I feel or my my belief is that I deserve respect.,routine,52_35,P,od,,Mujhe ya mere vichar mein vishwaas hai ki main sammaan ke layak hoon.
36,being upset and like disrespected and again yeah ,routine,52_36,P,od,,"Being upset and being disrespected again, yeah."
37,"was aggravation, yeah. frustration, frustration. So that's, that would be one of the consequences of how you processed her behavior. Does that make sense? Feeling the frustration Feeling would be one of the consequences like an ABC kind of chance you have the activating event. She criticizes you. Your belief is that you deserve respect. And clearly she violated that belief. Right? She She didn't show you the respect that you deserved record your belief system. And one of the consequences, therefore, was this feeling of frustration. Were there any other consequences?",routine,52_37,T,irq,,"Agar usne mujhe criticise kiya to mujhe sakth niraasha hogi. Thehruv, niraasha. Isliye, uske vyavahaar ko tumhara prakaar se prasann karne ka ek natija hoga. Kya yeh samajhne layak hai? Niraasha ka ahsaas karke ABC prakar ka vikalp hai, jaise ki tumhare activate karte mein usne tumhe criticize kiya. Tumhara vishwas hai ki tumhe maan ki upmaan ke kabil ho aur woh tumhein yeh upmaan nahi dikhaya. Theek hai na? Woh tumhein upmaan nahi kiya jo tumhare vishwas par pugara hai. Aur iske ek natije hain, isliye tumhein yeh niraasha ka ahsaas hua hai. Kya aur koi natije the?"
38,"Well, if we, like go forward, it's the kind of disarray or the tension, I guess, you know, in the office.",routine,52_38,P,id,,"Agar hum aage badh jaayein, toh yeh woh tarah ka uljhan ya tension hai, shayad, aapko maloom hai, office mein."
39,"To get that's, that's definitely a consequence. I'm thinking there's an intermediate consequence stuff. So you had that feeling of frustration. And what's the next thing you did after that meeting was over, ",routine,52_39,T,irq,,"Usne pane ke liye, woh pakka ek parinaam hai. Socho, waha ek bich ka parinaam raha hoga. Iske baad tumhe uss milaap se hamsha dukh hua hoga. Aur ab uss bethak ke baad, tumne kya kiya?"
40,"like confronted her, ",routine,52_40,P,id,,.जैसे ही उस
41,"you confronted her? Right. So you have kind of those two consequences. And that confrontation, it would appear has led her to kind of come on more strongly with her criticisms, which is another activating event. You could also think of as a consequence, but like I said, this is a cyclical. So you see how the A and the B and the C, a paradigm can fit in to what happened here at work for you.",routine,52_41,T,irq,,"Kya tumne use face kia? Thik hai. Toh tumhare paas do consequences sort of hai. Aur us confrontation ne usse apni criticism ke saath zyada force se aane ka raasta dikhaya hai, which is aakri tappa. Tum isko consequence ke taur par bhi soch sakte ho, lekin maine kaha na, ye chakravyuh hai. Isse tum ise dekh sakte ho ki at A aur B aur C, ek paradigm kaise is samasya ke saath baitht sakta hai jo tumhare kaam pe ghatit hui."
42,Does that make some some sense?,routine,52_42,T,yq,,वह कुछ प्रकार का समझ देता है
43,"It does. Yeah. And I mean, when you put it that way, and then you say it's cyclical, then you just, I can see I can visualize that going around my carousel.",routine,52_43,P,ack,,"Yeh karta hai. Haan. Aur main yeh kehna chahta hu, jab tum aise samjhaate ho, aur phir kehte ho ki yeh chakrachaal hai, toh bas, mai dekh paa raha hu ki yeh meri merry-go-round ke aaspas ghum raha hai."
44,"Sure, exactly. So it helps you to kind of see what caused what, and maybe what could have been changed or could be changed in the future. Right. So we can't go back and change that, but we can work on the future. So her criticism of you there's no direct way to change that. consequences and consequences that leaves the belief system Right, which is the deserving respect, right? One of the things we try to do in our abt is help people move from rigid thinking, to more flexible thinking.",routine,52_44,T,irq,,"Haan, bilkul. Isse aapko pata chalta hai ki kya kaaran kya hua hai, aur shayad kya badla ja sakta hai ya badla ja sakta hai bhavishya mein. Sahi hai. To woh theek hai jo hum wapas nahi badal sakte, par hum bhavishya par kaam kar sakte hai. To uski tumse jo narazgi hai, usme seedha tarike se badalne ka koi tarika nahi hai. Parinaam aur parinaam jo bhaavna pranali ko chod dete hai. Bilkul, jo apmaan hua hai, sahi? Humari koshish hoti hai ki hum aapki madad se logon ko kathor soch se ghum kar, jyada nimble soch par laaye."
45,"So, kind of a rigid belief system would be enough that you said it in this way. But, you know, I, I demand and deserve respect, right at this particular level and people aren't meeting it. Right. Would you say that's a fair?",routine,52_45,T,id,,"Toh, kuch ek sakht vishwas pranali pad rahi hogi jo tumne isi tareeke se kaha hai. Lekin, dekh, mai, mai adhikar karta hoon aur samman ka pura haqdar hoon, bilkul iss level pe aur log isse pura nahi kar rahe hain. Thik hai. Kya tum kehoge ki yeh sahi hai?"
46,Yeah.,routine,52_46,P,ack,,Haan.
47,"Okay. Maybe a more flexible way of thinking would be that you'd like respect? respects good. Yeah. respects healthy and work environments, certainly. But if you don't get it, you can still function. It's tough for you. I can see that's tough. Tell me about that.",routine,52_47,T,irq,,"Acha. Shayad ek aur aaney-daaney tarika sochna hona chahiye, jahan aapko izzat pasand ho? izzat achchi hai. Haan. izzat sehatmand aur kaam ke maahaul ke baare mein, zaroori hai. Magar agar aapko nahi milta, toh aap ab bhi kam kar sakte hain. Aap ke liye mushkil hai. Main dekh sakta hoon, yeh mushkil hai. Mujhe is ke baare mein bataiye."
48,"I mean, I understand But you're saying I get it? I guess it's just kind of like anxiety with the anxiety we worked on. It's just getting there. ",symp/reasoning,52_48,P,id,,"Mera matlab hai, mujhe samajh aa gaya par tu keh rahi hai ki mai samajhti hu? Shayad yeh bas abhi tak kuch tarah ki chinta hai, jaise humne pahle ki thi. Bas wahi pahunch nahi pa raha hai."
49,Mm hmm. Do you are you willing to think of and challenge your beliefs in this instance?,routine,52_49,T,ack,,Haanji. Kya aap is waqt apne vishwas ko sochne aur us par sawaal uthane ke liye taiyar hai?
50,Yes.,routine,52_50,P,ack,,Haan.
51,"Yeah. Tough though just as you mentioned, like what the inside says tough How long have you had this belief cuz mentality of I deserve respect.",routine,52_51,T,irq,,"Haan. Tough hai, jaise aapne kaha bilkul, attitude kaisa hai andar woh bhi tough hai. Yeh aapki yeh maanane ki belief kitne samay se hai, kyunki humari mentality mein hai ki hume izzat milni chahiye."
52,"Oh gosh, Um, since I was like a teenager. So long time",routine,52_52,P,id,,"Arre, um, main jaise ki ek teenager thi tab se. To bohot dino se shaayad."
53,this has been a relatively persistent part of your life. Let's play system. So changing it's going to be work.,routine,52_53,T,gc,,Ye aapki jindagi ka ek nazuk hissa raha hai. Chalo khelte hain debugger. To ise badalna kaafi mushkil hoga.
54,"So, if you can apply a different philosophy apply more flexible thinking? Next time you're in a meeting, she still criticized you in the meetings. ",routine,52_54,T,gc,,"Toh, agar tum ek alag tareeke se soch sakte ho toh kya tum zyada flexible vichaar laga sakte ho? Agla baar jab tum ek meeting mein honge, woh tumhe meetings mein bhi abhi bhi criticize karti rahegi."
55,Yeah.,routine,52_55,P,ack,,Haa.
56,"So if you filter that through belief system now your first urge might be think to be, I'm being disrespected again. I it probably comes on that way. You kind of feel it.",routine,52_56,T,gc,,"So agar tum use belief system se filter karte ho, toh ab tumhari pehli khwahish ho sakti hai ki main phir se beizzat hoon. Shayad yehi terha se hota hai. Tumhe thodi si mehsoos hoti hai."
57,"Yeah, it, it starts in my stomach and then goes all the way up.",routine,52_57,P,ack,,"Haan, yeh toh, yeh mere pet mein shuru ho jaata hai aur phir poori tarah upar jaata hai."
58,"So it'll be your first physiological reaction, right and emotional reaction. But if you can kind of pause that moment and apply more flexible thinking, like I talked about, right, which is, I'd like respect, right. But I can survive and function without it. At some level, I can accept that. I'm not going to get it all the time. Other other areas of life for you do get respect. ",routine,52_58,T,yq,,"Toh yeh aapki pehli physiological reaction hogi, sahi hai aur emotional reaction bhi. Lekin agar aap uss pal par thoda roke aur zyada flexible thinking istemaal karein, jaise ki maine bataya hai, sahi hai, jo hai, I'd like respect, sahi hai. Lekin main zinda reh sakta hoon aur kaam bhi kar sakta hoon bina uske bhi. Kisi level par main usse sweekar kar sakta hoon. Hamesha mujhe wo nahi milega. Aur dusre zindagi ke kshetron mein aapko ussi ko respect milta hai."
59,"Yeah. For my friends and my family, I feel I feel like they give me. it's actually mutual respect. They give me respect I give them respect and",routine,52_59,P,ack,,"Haan, mere doston aur mere parivaar ke liye, mujhe lagta hai ki vo mujhe dete hain. Yeh asal mein saamana h mare satha ek dusre ki izzat hai. Ve mujhe samman dete hain aur mai bhi unhe samman deti hun."
60,"Well, I think",inactive,52_60,P,od,,"""Areh, I think"""
61,"over time, if I learned to do that I first starting like within side of me like I wouldn't get that initial Like,",story,52_61,P,od,,"Samay ke saath, agar maine woh karne seekha toh shuruwatt mein mujhe uss pahle jaise andar hi andar pasand nahi aati thi."
62,punched in the gut.,story,52_62,P,od,,Seedha peet mein maren.
63,And I wouldn't have the urge to lash out at her. Especially if it is trying to be constructive criticism resulting in a situation where there's that tension in our office.,story,52_63,P,od,,"Aur main usse phat se utarne ka jazba nahi rakhungi. Khaas kar agar wo humare office mein usase constructive criticism kar rahi ho, toh humare office mein wo tension hai."
64,I'd be able to do that I,story,52_64,P,od,,Main kar paaungi.
65,think I'd be able to approach her and maybe ask her she'd want to get coffee or something and maybe sit down and kind of,story,52_65,P,od,,मुझे लगता है कि मैं उससे मिलने की कोशिश कर सकता हूं और शायद उसे पूछ सकता हूँ कि क्या वह कॉफी पीना चाहेगी या कुछ करन
66,talking with her.,story,52_66,P,od,,Uski saath baat kar raha tha.
67,"maybe I misunderstood her in the first meeting. And she really didn't mean to undermine me as I said,",story,52_67,P,od,,Shayad maine paheli mulakaat mein usse galti se galt samajh liya tha. Aur wo sach mein mujhe kamzor nazar nahi dikhana chahti thi jaise maine kaha tha.
68,and then go from there.,story,52_68,P,od,,Phir wahan se jaao.
69,"So either way, gathering the information, meaning having a discussing discussion with her, it would be helpful because I mean, you may find that you really see things so like, and it was just a disagreement in terms of her criticism in the way you interpreted, or she may have been trying to be critical and you'll know that to be really Can't control someone else's behavior. But it will give you an idea of maybe what our intentions were and how you can go forward to repair that relationship so that it functions. ",routine,52_69,T,orq,,"Toh dono tarah se, agar hum information gather karte hai, matlab usse ek baat-cheet karne se, toh yeh kaafi helpful hoga kyunki main manta hoon, tum shayad dekho ki aap ek hi cheez ko apne tareeke se dekhte ho, aur wo sirf ek takraar thi uss tarah ki jisme ussne tere vichaar ko samjha nahi, ya shayad wo tere prashansha karne ki koshish kar rahi thi aur tujhe pata hoga ki dusre ke behaviour ko control nahi kar sakte. Lekin yeh ek idea dega ki shaayad uski iraade kya thi aur aage kaise aap uss rishte ko theek kar sakte ho jisse wo chal sake."
70,"Yeah. I certainly don't want like, our upper management to, you know, get involved and there'll be a bigger issue.",routine,52_70,P,ack,,"Haan. Mai bilkul nahi chahata ki, humare upper management mein, aapko pata hai, shamil ho jaaye aur phir badi mushkil ho jaaye."
71,"You don't want them to have to come and sort that out. Right, you can sort out their own. And that would be a good application of coping skills and flexible thinking. So is that something you feel like you can try over the course of the next week?",routine,52_71,T,yq,,"Tumhe chahte ho ki woh aakar use hal karne ke liye na pareshan hon. Theek hai, tum apna khud ka hal kar lo. Aur yeh acchi tarah se cope karne ki kala aur prbandhshil soch ka ek accha upyog hoga. To kya tumhe lagta hai ki tum agle hafto ke dauran yeh koshish kar sakte ho?"
72,I will definitely try.,routine,52_72,P,ack,,मैं जरूर कोशिश क
73,"So really our plan move forward as a couple parts. So one would be smooth things over and sensitive, discussing this with her, letting her know you're aware what's going on and you want to try to resolve it and the second part would be Trying to move a little bit away from the rigid, you know, I deserve respect to, I would like respect but I'll function adequately without respect from everyone. I know that's tough. That's gonna be that's gonna be the challenge, right? But this will be this will give us good information and give you some practice. Does it all make sense to you?",symp/reasoning,52_73,T,irq,,"So actually hamara plan hai ki hame agli kuch cheezein karni hogi. Ek hai ki hum samjhate hue sensitively situation ko suljhayein aur unhe bata dein ki hume pata hai ki kya ho raha hai aur hum issko suljhane ki koshish karna chahte hain aur dusra hissa hoga ki hum thoda sa rigidness se thoda door jaayein, aap jante ho, hume izzat milti chahiye lekin hum achi tarah se kaam kar sakte hain bina kisi ke izzat ke. Mujhe pata hai ki yeh mushkil hoga. Yeh hamein acha information dega aur aapko practice bhi dega. Kya yeh sab aapko samajh mein aaya?"
74,"Yeah, it's pretty clear. You explained it really well. Thank you.",routine,52_74,P,id,,"Haan, yeh kaafi saaf hai. Tumne isko bahut hi achi tarah se samjhaya hai. Dhanyavaad."
75,"So, let's work on those two, those two elements. Right and next time you come in, we'll check in on those two and make any needed modifications to our strategy and we'll kind of move forward from there. ",routine,52_75,T,gc,,"Toh chalo, hum dono pe kaam karte hain, dono elements pe. Agla baar aap aate ho, hum un dono pe check karenge aur zarurat padne par hum apni strategy mein koi bhi modification karenge aur phir se aage badhte rahenge."

81,summary,The patient has been experiencing anxiety. The patient has had trouble with one of their coworkers since they don't respect the patient as deserved. The patient has spoken about this to the coworker and it has become worse after that. The patient feels the coworker's criticism is more than the limit and they are harsh. The therapist runs through the ABC model with the patient. The therapist suggests to adopt flexible thinking to adapt to the situation. The patient agrees they could try to work things out with the coworker over a cup of coffee in a calmer manner. The therapist explains the two elements to try this week is to discuss with the coworker and resolve it and secondly to function adequately without respect from everyone. ,,,,,
