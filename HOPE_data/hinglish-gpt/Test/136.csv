And I wanted to make sure that all my friends were Okay, so I didn't let myself drink too much.",story,136_3,P,ack,-2.0,"Main samajh gaya kya tu kehna chahta hai par sach mein, maine waisa hi kiya. Soch raha tha ki main sab par niyantran rakhta hoon. Aur maine apne aap ko zyada bhatakne nahi diya. Mujhe yeh nahi tha ke mera koi haath na chal jaye. Main chahta tha ki sab mere doston ko theek ho, isliye maine zyada sharab nahi pi."
4,"There's really no such thing as not drinking too much. I mean, anything that's drinking when you're under age is drinking too much. You know, like, think about it. Think about all the things that can happen to you.",routine,136_4,T,id,-3.0,"Aisa poonchho toh koi cheez jyada nahi peena hota hai. Matlab, koi bhi cheez jab tum chhote ho aur tum peete ho toh woh bahut jyada peena hota hai. Samajh lo, har ek cheez ko. Socho, tumhare saath kya-kya ho sakta hai."

It's just the",routine,136_7,P,id,-2.0,"Mein lagta hai mai itna zyada nahin peeti. Mera matlab hai, yeh zyadatar social gatherings ke liye hai.

10,"Tommy, I'm just so concerned, you know, can't you think of anything better to do?",routine,136_10,T,gc,0.0,"Tommy, main bas itna hi chinta kar raha hoon, pata hai, kya tum kuchh behtar soch sakte ho?"
11,"I guess I can, I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you're coming from.",routine,136_11,P,gc,-1.0,"Mere khayal se main kar sakta hu, shayad main apne schoolwork mein zyada productive ho sakta hu aur parties jaane ki bajaye aur main samajh sakta hu tum kahaan se aa rahe ho."
12,"Yeah, is are your friends the problem? Like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with?",routine,136_12,T,ack,-3.0,"Haan, kya tumhare dost hi samasya hai? Shayad tumhe bas yuva sammelan mein zaada bacho ke saath ghoomna shuru karna chahiye aur un bacho ke saath nahi jo tum party kar rahe ho?"
13,"Yeah, I guess I haven't really put it on myself, I guess it's really been forced on their account. And I've just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun. And I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can.",story,136_13,P,gc,-2.0,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki maine aisa wakai khud par nahi dala hai, mujhe lagta hai ki inke liye ye zor se ho raha hai. Aur main unke nishane par chal raha hun kyonki yeh lag raha hai ki jo wo kar rahe hain, bahot mazedaar hain. Aur main bas yeh chahta hun ki main apni high school ki anubhav ko aise hi poora karun."
14,"Well, there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice, right? That's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you. And I just, you know, I really think you should think about making a big change here.",routine,136_14,T,gc,0.0,"Waise toh bohot si cheezein hain joh pal mein mazzeedar lagti hain, par hum jaantey hain ki woh accha faisla nahi hai, sahi toh? Yeh kuch cheezein hai jo hum har samay baat karte hain jahan hum apne zindagi ke liye acche faisley leney ki baat karte hain aur wohi karna jo aapke liye sabse behtar hai. Aur main, aapko kehna chahti hoon, aapko iss pareshani mein bada badlaav karney par sochna chahiye."
15,"Yeah, I, I do see that. Maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I It does make a lot of sense. And I, I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level of drinking.",routine,136_15,P,gc,-1.0,"Haan, main, main toh dekh raha hu. Shayaad agar main thoda kam peeta toh meri zindagi ko kuch had tak behtar bana sakta hu aur main toh bahut samajhdaar hu. Aur main, main sochta hu ki main apne nashe ka level kam karne mein aur zyada koshish kar sakta hu."
16,I think youreally need to quit.,routine,136_16,T,vc,-3.0,Mujhe lagta hai ki tumhe sach mein chhodna chahiye.
17,"Yeah, I mean, alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I, I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely. I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life.",story,136_17,P,cr,0.0,"Yeah, I mean, yar, sharab toh hamari society mein bohot zyada bani hai aur yeh har jagah mere saath hai jahan bhi main jaaun, parties aur sab cheezein. Isiliye mujhe lagta hai ki main isse bas adjust kar lu ya kam se kam uske asar ko samjhu, tabhi main ise poori tarah se apni zindagi se nikaalon. Mujhe nahi lagta ki yeh meri zindagi ko bilkul barbaad karegi."
18,"I think you're wrong. You know, it really worries me. Anyway, I wish you would quit. If all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing. You know, I appreciate you talking to me about this, but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it. That's really important. ",routine,136_18,T,gc,-2.0,"""Mujhe lagta hai tum galat ho. Tum jaante ho, mujhe is baat ki sachmuch chinta hai. Waise hi, main chahungi ki tum chod do. Agar tum sirf criticism karogi toh kuch nahi karne se achha hai. Tum jaante ho, mujhe tumse iske baare mein baat karne se khushi hai, lekin main aage bhi tumse isi baare mein baat karungi. Yah bahut zaroori hai."""
19,"Yeah, I, I just I don't see the problem in it right now. And maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic event experience. But, umm",story,136_19,P,gc,-2.0,"Haan, main, main bas main abhi usmein samasya nahi dekhta. Aur shayad yeh isliye hai kyunki mere paas abhi tak uska bhayanak ghatna ka anubhav nahi hua hai. Par, hmm"
20,do you want to wait for that to happen? Do you want to wait for a dramatic experience?,routine,136_20,T,irq,0.0,Kya tum uske hone ka intezaar karna chahte ho? Kya tum ek jagmagahat bhavishya ke liye intezaar karna chahte ho?
21,"You're right. I don't want I don't want to be too far gone. Before it's too late. Like I I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape. And I I guess I've never really had any, any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much are affected anybody close to me that much. So I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of, but in reality, I might not have as much control as I think. ",story,136_21,P,id,-2.0,"Tum sahi keh rahe ho. Mujhe itni door jaane ki zaroorat nahi hai. Pehle hi late na ho jaaye. Jaise ki main kuch aisa soch sakti hun jahan meri wajah se bachna mushkil ho. Aur maine kabhi koi aisi ghatna nahi dekhi hai jahan sharab ne mujh par ya meri kisi nazdeeki shakhs par asar dala ho. Isliye main lagta hai ki main is par kaboo rakhti hun, lekin haqeeqat mein ho sakta hai ki mera itna kaboo na ho jitna mujhe lagta hai."
22,"All right. Well, maybe it's something we can work on together. And, you know, I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control  here and stop drinking.",routine,136_22,T,ack,-2.0,"Thik hai. Suno, shayad hum milke ispe kaam kar sakte hain. Aur pata hai, mujhe lagta hai humein ek aisi strategy dhundhni chahiye jo teri madad kar sake taki tu yahan par control paa sake aur peene se rok sake."
23,"Yeah, I think that that would be a good step forward into and life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol.",routine,136_23,P,ack,-1.0,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki yeh ek accha kadam hoga zindagi mein jaa kar shaarab chhudane ke liye aur zindagi ke sahi pahluo ko mehsoos karne ke bajaye madhoshi ki jagah."
