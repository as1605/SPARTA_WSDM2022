Theek hai? Jab tumne kaha tha ki tum vomit kar rahe ho blubbery, vomit kar rahe ho bright red blood aur wo kya thi jaise tiny spots ya badi spots?"
9,"It was a it was almost filling a toilet wasn't that much. I wasn't like that it was enough that I could see it in the toilet, and I was throwing up.",symp/reasoning,48_9,P,id,,Uski ek jaesi tha ki jaise loo bharne wala ho. Usse itna zyada nahi tha ki main use loo mein dekh sakoon aur usi ko phenkne laga.

Main jaanta hoon ki woh ek aur cancer ka kaaran hai."
18,"Look, I can understand why you're worried. All right, because throwing up Blood is scary, and waking up soaked in sweat in the middle of the night. That doesn't feel right either. Let me ask you a couple of questions that might help explain things. When did you have your last drink?",routine,48_18,T,gc,,"Dekh, Main samajh sakta hoon ki tu itni pareshan hai. Theek hai, Kyunki pittay Blood aana aur raat bhar kapa khuwab me aana yeh dono batein normal nahi hain. Mujhe tujhe kuch sawaal puchne hain jo iss pareshani ka shikaar hai. Aakhri peg/sharab kab pee thee?"
19,"Actually, just before I came here,",routine,48_19,P,id,,"Beech mein, jaise hi main yahaan aaya,"
20,"okay, so that was earlier this morning. All right, what did you have?",routine,48_20,T,irq,,"Thik hai, yeh tabhi subah thi. Theek hai, tumne kya liya tha?"
21,"I had orange juice and I had some vodka in it. It's the only thing actually that like steadies me enough to get out the door. I don't ever go out that often. But right now,",routine,48_21,P,id,,"Main ek glass nimbu ka juice piya tha aur usmein thoda vodka mila tha. Yeh theek tarah se mujhe door jaane ke liye steady karne ka ek hi kaam tha. Mujhe kabhi bohot jyada bahar nahi jaana. Par abhi,"
22,so tell me how it helps you.,routine,48_22,T,irq,,Toh mujhe batao yeh aapko kaise madad karta hai?
23,"It's just studies me studies me like I'm, you know, I'm shaking all the time. I'm just like,",routine,48_23,P,id,,"Mera sirf pallu padhne hi padhne lagta hai jaise main, jaanti hoon, hamesha hi kaanp raha hoon. Main to sirf yahi soch raha hoon."
24,"So over the course of the day, in order to study yourself in order to feel calmer. How many drinks do you end up having?",routine,48_24,T,irq,,"तो दिन के दौरान, अपने आप को स्टडी करने के लिए और बहुत शांत महसूस करने के लिए कैसे"
25,"Five? Hmm, maybe",routine,48_25,P,id,,"Paanch? Hmm, shayad."
26,singles or doubles?,routine,48_26,T,irq,,Ekla ya Dohara?
27,I don't measure,routine,48_27,P,id,,Main koi maape nahi hain
28,right. So is it mainly vodka,routine,48_28,T,gc,,"Sahi hai kya, bas Vodka hi hai?"
29,"Sometimes if I'm feeling really like my stomach is really upset, I'll drink cider. So that's its cider or vodka because",symp/reasoning,48_29,P,gc,,"Mana jab main bahut upset stomach feel kar raha hoon, to main apple cider pee leta hoon. Isliye, mera favorite hai ki cider ya vodka"
30,"and you ever get that feeling in the morning that some people describe that they wake up feeling so edgy. They need a drink to calm down. Yeah. It's like the only thing that works for me. Anything that works, too. So in the past week, do you think you've been drinking more?",story,48_30,T,irq,,"Aur aap ko kabhi subah aisi feeling ho jaati hai, jaise ki log bolte hain ki unhone swaad ki saans leke uthne par itna tense jaisa laga. Unhein ek peene ka kareebi chakhna padega taaki unhein shaanti mil sake. Haan bilkul. Waisa mera liya kaafi kaam karta hai. Aur jo kuchh bhi kaam kare woh bhi khatum hai. To aapko ya pichhle hafte mein kya lagta hai ki aapne zyada piye honge?"
31,In the last week? Not so much in the last couple of weeks maybe?,routine,48_31,P,crq,,Khaaki mein aakhri hafte mein? Kuchh zyaada nahi hain aakhri do hafton mein shayad?
32,"Hasn't been daily. Oh, yeah. Right. So the longest you've gone without a drink in the last month would be how long?",routine,48_32,T,cd,,"Aaj se nahi ho raha hai. Haan, haan. Theek hai. To, aakhir aapne chhote waali maheene mein piye hue sabse zyada dinon ka kya intezaar kiya?"
33,"I don't know. Actually. I mean, I don't know. I've got you know, I've got a lot going on. Right. Yeah. So my, my sister is in Boston, she's got cancer and I know like I should be calling her and I can't do that. My mom is really sick and she's horrible, and I'm the only one that Who can go see her? And I go see my mother and she just yells and screams at me and she's got this email and it's just",story,48_33,P,id,,"Mujhe nahi pata. Koi baat nahi. Matlab, mujhe nahi pata. Mujhe jitne bhi baatein hain, Zaroori hain. Chalo theek hai. Ab behen koi Boston mein hai aur woh cancer se bimar hai aur mujhe jaana chahiye usko call karne ke liye lekin main woh nahi kar sakta. Mom bhi bahut kamzor hai aur woh buri tarah se hai aur main woh ek hi hoon jo jakar usko dekh sakta hai, wahan jaane par woh har baar mujhe gaaliyan deti hai aur paise maangne aati hai aur bas yehi sab hai."
34,"so for all of those things, the alcohol helps.",routine,48_34,T,yq,,"Sabke liye ye sab, sharab ka kaam aata hai."
35,"Yeah, yeah.",routine,48_35,P,ack,,"Yep, Yep."
36,"Yeah. And does it ever happen sort of by the end of the day, that you have trouble the next day remembering what happened?",routine,48_36,T,irq,,"Ki haan. Aur kya hota hai ki aakhirkaar din ke baad, agli din yaad karna mushkil ho jaata hai, jo kuch bhi hua hai?"
37,"I guess. I mean, I, you know, my days don't differ that much. But I, you know, I'll fall asleep in front of television and then I'm not seeing lots of people so I you know, there's not big events in my life that I would be remembering. I just, you know, especially now that I'm feeling so not well, that I",story,48_37,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta hai. Main matlab kar raha hoon. Meri dinain kafi alag nahi hoti hain. Lekin main, jaante ho, t.v. ke saamne so jaata hoon aur phir log kam dekhne lagta hoon issliye mujhe koi badi cheeze yaad nahi rehti jo main yaad karoon. Bas, jaante ho, abhi main itna achha nahi feel karraha hoon ki main.."
38,"yeah, there's not much that I would have to remember",story,48_38,P,id,,"Ji haan, zyada kuch yaad rakhne ki zaroorat nahi hai."
39,having that. Have you tried it all to cut down on your drinking?,routine,48_39,T,yq,,Aapne sab kuchh toh karne ki koshish ki hai apne peene ki ghoom ki kataari kam karne ke liye?
40,I did. I did.,routine,48_40,P,ack,,Main kar diya. Main kar diya.
41,"You know, I had a boyfriend who",story,48_41,P,cd,,"Aapko pata hai, mere pass ek boyfriend tha jo."
42,"you know, was Sort of casual coming over and, and he, he basically said he couldn't be with me anymore because I drink too much. And so I tried. I tried. I was like, Well, yeah, and then he left. So who cares, right? I mean, right?",story,48_42,P,id,,"Tum jaante ho. Thodi si bimaari si, woh mujhse door ho gaya kyunki main zyaada pi liya karta hoon. Maine koshish ki, par woh chala gaya. Phir kya hai, sahi hai na? Main samajhta hoon sahi hai."
43,You find yourself feeling feeling guilty about the alcohol.,symp/reasoning,48_43,T,yq,,Aap apne aapko sharab peene ke baare mein krodhita mehsoos kar rahe ho.
44,"I feel guilty about my sister, right? I feel guilty that I can't like I just can't. I can't even call her like I can't.",symp/reasoning,48_44,P,id,,Mujhe Meri Behen ke baare mein sharminda laga hai na? Maine sharminda laga hai ki main usko jaise chaah raha hu waisa nahi kar sakta. Usse waise bhi na call kar sakta hu.
45,Right. So,routine,48_45,P,id,,Theek hai toh.
46,"if I, if I could pull it together than I could,",routine,48_46,P,id,,"Agar main sahi tarah saamne aa sakta, tab main yeh kar sakta."
47,"because what I understand from what you're telling me is that the drinking helps meet a certain need for you, in terms of trying to hold things together with all this stuff going on, and meets a need in terms of trying to keep you calmer. But at the same time, it's getting you into trouble. It's getting into trouble in terms of relationships, but it's also the most likely act explanation for why you've been throwing up blood isn't why the lab results that I've got are consistent with an amount of alcohol that's too much for your body to handle. Really, really, and that means, ideally, that we're going to work together to find a way to do something about it.",story,48_47,T,gc,,"Mujhe yeh lagta hai ki jo tum kah rahe ho, peene se ek anban meetha hi ja raha hai, is sab kharabi ke beech rakhne ke liye. Isse tumko shaanti milti hai. Lekin usi anban se tau tumhara nuksaan ho raha hai. Rishton ke liye to bahut hi bura, aur lab ke result se bhi maan lena chahiye ki tumhe bahut saara sharab peena chhodna hoga. To, hum milke ye kaam karenge aur isko theek karenge."
48,summary,"The blood work of patient after checkup is discussed. The patient is throwing up blood, once the previous weekend and then the day before. The patient feels they have cancer. The patient threw enough blood filling the toilet. They feel sick and have headache throughout the day. The patient also sweats in the middle of the night and feels it is symptom of cancer. The patient has five drinks a day in order to feel calmer and it is mainly vodka. The patient drinks cider if stomach is upset. The patient does not drink everyday, but drinks in the morning sometimes to avoid edgy feeling. The patient is not able to call their sister who is suffering from cancer and is yelled at by mom when they go meet her, and hence alcohol helps. The patient tried cutting down alcohol for their boyfriend but he left and patient doesn't care anymore. The patient feels guilty that they are not able to call their sister due to alcohol issue. The therapist assures to find a way to work together to resolve this. ",,,,,
