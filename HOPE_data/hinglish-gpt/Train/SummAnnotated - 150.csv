I signed a stay at home from school, you know, hurt his head. He wanted to bake brownies with my son. Okay, let's bake brownies. So then we eat the whole pan and we bake two more pans.

I got a school break and then my son got hurt. He wanted to make brownies. So, we made brownies. But then we ended up eating the whole batch and then we made two more. And then it didn't just stop at brownies, you know? We started eating hamburgers, french fries, candy and even stopped at Wah Wah on our way back. It's disgusting.

17,"Oh my god, I would love to Yeah.",symp/reasoning,150_17,P,gc,1.0,"Bhai, main toh khush ho jaunga Yeah."
18,"So if you're looking at a scale of one to 10, one was, it's not important to change and 10 was extremely important change. This is just how important it is for you to curtail your eating 10 times very important to you.",symp/reasoning,150_18,T,irq,0.0,"Agar aap ek se das tak ke range par dekh rahe hain, toh ek ka matlab hai, ise badalne ki zarurat nahi hai aur das ka matlab hai ki change karna behad zaruri hai. Yeh tab hi hai jab aapke liye khana kam karne ke liye das guna behad zaruri hai."
19,"Yeah, it's very important",symp/reasoning,150_19,P,id,0.0,"Haan, yeh bahut maayene rakhta hai"
20,"very important. Okay. So what if I asked the same question except this time? You're confidence. So, one is you're not confident, all you can change, but 10 you're very confident you could change.",symp/reasoning,150_20,T,gc,0.0,"Bohot jaroori. Theek hai. Toh agar maine wahi sawal poocha phir se? Tumhara confidence. Toh, ek toh tum confident nahi ho, sab kuch change kar sakte ho, par das mein tum bahut confident ho toh change kar sakte ho."
21,"I could probably change for half a day. I've done it. And sometimes if I'm lucky, I'll get a week. But overall?",symp/reasoning,150_21,P,id,-1.0,"मैं शायद अधिकतर अपने लिए बदल सकता हूँ। मैंने ऐसा किया है। और कभी-कभी मेरा भाग्य साथ देता है, ल"
22,overall  yeah,symp/reasoning,150_22,T,cd,0.0,Overa
23,it's impossible. Like you want a number at zero.,symp/reasoning,150_23,P,id,-1.0,Yeh aisa to namumkin hai. Jaise tum chahte ho ki koi number zero pe ho.
24,So it's below the below the scale of one to 10 this is,symp/reasoning,150_24,T,crq,0.0,So iske neeche ek se dus tak ka scale hai.
25,Yeah,symp/reasoning,150_25,P,cd,0.0,Haan
26,so you can have no confidence at all.,symp/reasoning,150_26,T,crq,0.0,तो आपको कोई भी भरोसा नहीं हो सकता है

28,"So, on one hand you'd like to, you'd like to stop the eating, It's important to but on the other hand, you don't believe you can do it. ",symp/reasoning,150_28,T,gc,0.0,"Toh, ek haath pe tu khaana bandh karna chahta hai, yeh zaruri hai, lekin dusre haath pe tu yeh nahi maanta ki tu kar sakta hai."
29,I can't do it.,symp/reasoning,150_29,P,cd,-1.0,mai yeh nahi kar sakti.
30,You can't do it?,symp/reasoning,150_30,T,crq,0.0,Tum kar nahi paoge kya?
31,I can't.,symp/reasoning,150_31,P,cd,0.0,Main nahi kar sakta.
32,"it can't be done. Have there been any other changes you have been able to make, say in the last few years that have been positive.",symp/reasoning,150_32,T,gc,0.0,"Yeh nahin ho sakta hai. Kya aapne koi aur badlaav kar paaye hain, haal hi mein jo sakaratmak rahe ho?"

35,Yeah. Yeah.,symp/reasoning,150_35,P,cd,0.0,Haan. Haan.
36,What do you think makes the this thought I'll just refer to as the food problem so much more powerful ? So much more difficult to tackle?,symp/reasoning,150_36,T,orq,0.0,"Tum kya sochte ho ki is soch ko khane ki samasya ke roop me jo mai bus sanket kar raha hu, isse aur zyada takatwar banata hai?

43,Yeah.,symp/reasoning,150_43,P,ack,0.0,Haan.
44,Okay. How about other foods that could be contributing the problem? Maybe you don't enjoy as much as chocolate.,symp/reasoning,150_44,T,irq,0.0,Ab theek hai. Aur kya khane ki cheezein hongi jo samasya ka ek karan ho sakti hain? Shayad tumhe chocolate se itni khushi nahi hoti jitni kisi aur cheez se.
45," Oh, potato chips. French fries. Mexican food. What else? Cheese?",symp/reasoning,150_45,P,id,-3.0,"Arre, aloo ke chips. French fries. Mexican khana. Aur kya? Paneer?"

49,Yeah.,symp/reasoning,150_49,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
50,"So of the candy, so I want to focus just on the candies. Okay, and not to the foods just for now. The thought of like I introduced the idea of stopping eating chocolate. How would you react to that? ",symp/reasoning,150_50,T,gc,0.0,"Toh, mai sirf candy par dhyan dena chahta hu, khaane ki vastuon par abhi nahi. Jab maine chocolate khane se rukne ka idea bataya toh tu kaise react karega?"

55,I can just tell you I don't even want to pretend.,symp/reasoning,150_55,P,cd,-1.0,Main tumhe bata sakti hoon ki main kewal tume jhoota naheen bolna chahti hoon.
56,"So you know that for sure. How about the let's, let's go, for example with the Skittles. What if I introduce the idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles?",symp/reasoning,150_56,T,gc,0.0,"To tum jante ho na ki pakka. Chalo uske saath, chalo, Skittles ke saath, udaharan ke taur pe.

60,"you could. It's up to you whether or not but if I introduced that idea of stopping the consumption of Skittles, how would you react to that?",symp/reasoning,150_60,T,gc,0.0,"Tum kar sakte ho. Ye aap par hai ki tum karo ya nahi lekin agar maine Skittles khane ki practice bandh karne ki baat ki, to tum uss par kaise respond karoge?"
61,I don't really understand why.,symp/reasoning,150_61,P,id,-1.0,Mujhe sach mein nahi samajh aata ki kyu.
62,"Well, it represents a change in the direction that you want to move.",symp/reasoning,150_62,T,gc,0.0,यह मनाता है कि आप चाहते हैं कि आप किस दिशा में आगे बढ़ें।
63,"But if I stopped eating Skittles, I'm still going to eat brownies I'm still going to eat. Yeah,",symp/reasoning,150_63,P,gc,-3.0,"Lekin agar Skittles khana band kardiya, toh main abhi bhi brownies khaane wala hoon. Haan,"
64,"we know we know that scenario that you know, you can't really make a change right now from what you're saying. Like that's the idea of stuffing chocolate is not going over well, with you",symp/reasoning,150_64,T,gc,0.0,"Humko pata hai ki woh jo situation hai, jiske baare mein tum jaante ho, abhi tumhare kehne se kuch badlav nahi ho sakte. Yehi woh khayal hai ki chocolate ko stuffing karna abhi tak tumhare liye theek nahi hai."
65,"no, it's not gonna happen.",symp/reasoning,150_65,P,gc,-3.0,"Nahi, yeh ho hi nahi sakta."
66,and that's fine. But the idea of stopping Skittles,symp/reasoning,150_66,T,orq,0.0,Aur who thik hai. Lekin Skittles rukne ka vichaar achha nahi hai.
67,Its fine.,symp/reasoning,150_67,P,od,0.0,Yeh theek hai.

77,Yeah,symp/reasoning,150_77,P,cd,0.0,Haan
78,Even though you're not sure it'll actually contribute to solving the larger problem. We know that that's something that that's an area where you don't really see a change as as likely,symp/reasoning,150_78,T,gc,0.0,"Dekho, agar tumhe sach much yeh vishwas nahi hai ki yeh bada masla hal karne mein koi sahayata karega. Hum jante hai ki yeh woh jagah hai jahan pe tune koi badlaav hone ka asar nahi dekha hai jaise jaise sambhav."
79,"If I don't eat Skittles, this week or even for the rest of my life, is it going to solve my problem? No, but will I do it? If that's what you want me to do? Yeah, that's fine.",symp/reasoning,150_79,P,gc,0.0,"Agar mein Skittles nahi khaaungi, is hafte ya phir apni saari zindagi tak, kya yeh mera masla hal ho jayega? Nahi, lekin kya mein karoongi?

85,"Yeah, sure.",symp/reasoning,150_85,P,gc,0.0,"Haan, zaroor."
86,Not a huge change. But it's one that we can work on.,symp/reasoning,150_86,T,gc,0.0,
87,Alright,symp/reasoning,150_87,P,gc,0.0,"""Thik"
88,"And we want you to be able to, you know, genuinely buy into the goal. I mean, if you don't think it's important, we can talk about other areas of change.",symp/reasoning,150_88,T,gc,0.0,"Aur hum chahte hain ki aap is laayak ho sakein, aap jaante hain, ke humeshah se lakshya mein puri tarah se shaamil ho jaayen. Mera matlab agar aapko yeh mahatvapurna nahi lagta, toh hum aur vaastuon ke baare mein baat kar sakte hain jo badalne ki zaroorat hai."
89,"No, I guess I see what you're saying. I mean, if I'm gonna be completely honest with you, I Well, that's what I'm paying you for. Right? So I don't think it's gonna work. I'll just tell you that ",symp/reasoning,150_89,P,gc,-1.0,"Nahi, main samajhta hun ki aap kya keh rahe ho. Yaar, agar main aapke saath poora khul ke baat karoon, toh main Honestly, main aapko hi paise de raha hun, na? Isliye mujhe lagta hai ye kaam nahi hoga. Main bas aapko yahi bata doonga."

91,Exactly.,symp/reasoning,150_91,P,cd,0.0,Bilkul
92,But that's what we have to work with right now. Because the larger problem is not something you mean the way you put it is it has control.,symp/reasoning,150_92,T,gc,0.0,Parantu uske sath aapko abhi kaam karna hoga kyunki badi samasya yeh hai ki aap iska matlab aap asa karte hai ke is par control hai.
93,Yeah. Yeah.,symp/reasoning,150_93,P,gc,0.0,"Haan, haan."

95,"no, no, no, sorry.",symp/reasoning,150_95,P,gc,0.0,"Nahi, nahi, nahi, maafi."
