0,"So, can you think of another case you're working on another family different than the one that we've initially talked about? Where you've made a decision that seemed like was fairly clear caught like one you would have made before and yet you're, you're thinking about it replaying it?",symp/reasoning,12_0,T,irq,,"Kya tum soch sakte ho ki tum doosre parivaar par kaam kar rahe ho, jo ki pehle ki baat ki hamne? Kaha jaa raha tha ki aapne ek faisla liya tha jo ki wazeh tha jaise pehle kabhi kiya tha aur fir bhi tum, tum uske baare mein soch rahe the, uske dohrane ke baare mein?"
1,"Yeah, I have this case. You know recently where it's a single dad, the mom passed away and I go in and check on him and his son, you You know, things are going well, but, you know, I think the dad has a hard time so it's not like it was before when the mom was there. Not that I wasn't there before that but you can just tell that like, things are a little different. But you know, obviously, my decision is that things are going well for the kid, you know, they're gonna he's gonna stay there. Dad is stable, but I just worried like, is the dad under too much stress? Is he really taking care of the kid as good as you know, what if he's just cleaning up the house and doing the right things on there while I'm not there? You know, does he have the energy to take care of his kid? Or is everything really the way I it appears? Or is there more going on? I just don't know.",story,12_1,P,id,-2.0,"Haan, mere paas yeh case hai. Pichle time mei jaha yeh ek single dad hai aur uski bibi mar gayi hai, uske baad mei jaake unka aur unke bete ka haal chaal dekhti hu. Sab theek chal raha hai, lekin pata nahi kyun, mujhe lagta hai ki dad ko bahut mushkil ho rahi hai, pehle jo tha waisa nahi hai jab mom waha thi. Mera matlab nahi hai ki main pehle waha nahi thi par bas aise hi lagta hai ki kuch alag sa ho gaya hai. Lekin maine faisla kiya hai ki bete ka haal accha kar raha hai, toh woh wahin rehega. Dad ko stability hai, par mujhe fikar hai ki kya woh bahut stress mein hai? Kya woh apne bete ka dhyaan waise hi de paayega jaise main nahi hu waha? Kya woh woh apne bete ka khayal rakhne ke liye energy rakhta hai ya sab dikhta hai jo hai? Ya phir kuch aur ho raha hai? Mujhe bas nahi pata."
2,Right. So you're handling it to the best of your ability. But there's still these these thoughts that are coming out. Kind of encouraging you to second guess your judgment?,routine,12_2,T,ack,,Theek hai. Toh tu apni kshamata ke aadar par isse sambhaal raha hai. Lekin ab bhi yeh vichaar utar rahe hain. Tere faisley par doobara sochne ke liye tujhe prerit kar rahe hain?
3,"Yeah. And it's like, I can't let it go. Like, I saw him like two weeks ago. And I still wonder if I have other cases like that. It's like, they're all running through my head. And I have these thoughts like, Did I do the right thing? Can I do the right thing?",routine,12_3,P,id,-2.0,"Haan. Aur yeh toh hai naa, main usse chhod nahi sakti. Jaise, maine usse do hafte pehle dekha tha. Aur abhi bhi mujhe doubt hai ki kahin mere paas aur aise maamle toh nahi hain. Aisa lagta hai jaise mere saare khayal mere dimaag mein ghumte hain. Aur mujhe uske baare mein yeh vichaar aate hain ki, kya maine sahi kaam kiya? Kya main sahi kaam kar sakti hun?"
4,"Maybe what if, what if the worst happens?",inactive,12_4,T,crq,,"Kya hoga agar, agar sabse bura ho jaye?"
5,"And I didn't see it. Like, what if something terrible happens? And I should have known better.",symp/reasoning,12_5,P,cd,-2.0,"Aur maine usse nahi dekha. Bilkul, agar kuch bhayanak hojaye toh? Aur mujhe pehle se pata hona chahiye tha."
6,"So it speaks back to your competency as a professional again. So that's, that seems to be court this. I think Here are several things you talk about seem to connect back to. Are you capable to be in this field? And should you be trusted?",story,12_6,T,id,,"Tu iske baare mein phir se ek professional ke tour par vaaps bolta hai. To wo, wo seems court this ko hona chaheeye. Main sochta hoon ki yahaan kaee chizen joi hain jo tum baat kar rahe ho seem. Kya tum is kshetr mein kaabil ho? Aur kya tum par bharosa kiya ja sakta hai?"
7,"Yeah, definitely.",inactive,12_7,P,op,,"Haan, bilkul."
8,"So coming back to thinking there are errors and thinking that all people make. And when these errors become repetitive and you can kind of see them applied in more than one areas of his life. We refer to that as a cognitive distortion. Okay? It's not bad or good. It's just how people think. It's just patterns that people fall into. And there are several different cognitive distortions, there's several patterns that we kind of see. come up often in this work, right as a counselor, wondering, in the situation where you're thinking, the worst possible outcome is unbearable, or likely or both. If you may be really focusing and emphasizing on that, to the exclusion of other evidence that suggests you've made a good decision. I see you're really focused on the negative outcome, the worst possible and maybe even unlikely outcome. And maybe not weighing all the evidence with the same weight, like you're putting more weight on the negative pay, that kind of makes sense.",story,12_8,T,id,,"इसलिए फिर सोचते हुए गलतियाँ हो रही हैं और यह सोचना कि हर इंसान की हो रही है। और जब ये गलतियाँ बार-बार हो जाती हैं और आप देख सकते हो कि उन्हें उसके जीवन के अलग-अलग क्षेत्रों में लागू किया जा सकता है। हम इसे cognitive distortion के रूप में उल्लेख करते हैं। ठीक है? यह ना अच्छा है और ना ही बुरा। यह सिर्फ लोगों का सोचने का तरीका है। यह सिर्फ लोगों के पैटर्न है जो वे गिरफ्त बनते हैं। और कई तरह की cognitive distortions है, ऐसे कई पैटर्न हैं जो हम देखते हैं। हमारे काम में हम अक्सर इन पैटर्नों को देखते हैं। जहां आप अपने सोच का उल्लेख कर रहे हो, वहां सबसे बुरा संभावित परिणाम न तो सहनीय होता है और न ही ज्यादा होता है। अगर आप इस पर ध्यान केंद्रित कर रहे हैं और उसे अन्य साक्ष्यों से हटाकर केंद्रबिंदु बना रहे हैं जो आपके लिए अच्छा फैसला है। मुझे लगता है आप बहुत ज्यादा नकारात्मक परिणाम, सबसे बुरे संभावित परिणाम और शायद ही संभावित बुरे परिणाम पर ध्यान केंद्रित कर रहे हैं। और शायद सारे साक्ष्य को एक ही वजन"
9,"Yeah. I mean, I think that that's probably true. Because before I felt fine, and now I just feel like everything's falling apart and not that much has changed. And so it kind of makes me think that that's probably what's going on, but I don't know how to change that.",symp/reasoning,12_9,P,id,,"Haan. Main toh soochta hu ke woh shayad sahi hai. Kyunki pehle main theek tha, aur ab sab kuch bigad raha hai par kuch zyada nahi badla hai. Isiliye mujhe lagta hai ke yahi ho raha hai, par main nahi jaanta ke isse kaise badla jaaye."
