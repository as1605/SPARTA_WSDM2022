9,"says around 10 people at the meeting. Yeah. And and as luck would have it, you tend to be toward the end. So can you describe what's happening say for the beginning of the meeting, in terms of what you're experiencing?",story,6_9,T,crq,,"Yeh 10 logon ne meeting mein kaha hai. Haan. Or fir taqdeer ka khel bhi tumhare sath hi hota hai, tumhara number aakhiri aata hai. Toh kya tum bata sakte ho ki meeting ki shuruwat mein kya ho raha hai, apne anubhavon ke hisab se?"

And that's usually when it starts, like kind of starts like, maybe like butterflies in my stomach kinda. And then after he makes his report, and then it just starts going around the room and my heart starts to be faster, my palms get sweaty, and I just, I just start to feel really nervous. I've realized that I might be kind of I start to tune out some of the other presentations. Because I, I start to become focused on how I'm feeling.",symp/reasoning,6_10,P,cd,,"Sowhen I walk in, I'm usually okay and you know, say good morning to everybody and then my boss calls ""mean order"".

And then after he makes his report, and then it just starts going around the room and my heart starts to ""beat faster"" , my palms get ""sweaty"", and I just, I just start to feel really ""nervous"". I've realized that I might be kind of ""tuning out"" some of the other presentations. Because, I start to become focused on how I'm ""feeling""."
11,And I focused focused on the physical sensation being nervous and the mental sensation and you're not really hearing what they're saying.,symp/reasoning,6_11,T,yq,,Or aur main dhyan kenditutwa par tha jo physical sensation mein nervous hona aur mental sensation mein focus karna hai aur aap sach mein nahi sun rahe ho jo woh keh rahe hain.

16,yeah,inactive,6_16,P,cd,,haan
17,"By the time it it's my turn to present I start. I just, I'm almost like just almost shaking. Yeah, I noticed that my hands are a little little off. And so keep my hands down, like in my lap and just that. I don't want anybody to see them shaking like that. And I have a paper in front of me that I just kind of read from. But when I start reading my my voice is a little shaky, and I kind of stutter and tripped over my words. And I just I feel like I'm not making good presentations and then it's not looking good to my boss.",story,6_17,P,cd,,"Mera number aane se pehle main shuru ho jata hu. Main bas, mujhe aisa lagta hai jaise main kaam se mot bhar gaya hu. Haan, maine dekha hai ki meri haatho mein thodi thodi takleef hai. Is liye main apne haath nicha rakhta hu, apni god mein aur bas. Main chahta nahi ki kisi ko mujhe aise hilte hue dekhe. Aur mere saamne ek kagaz hai jispar main padhte hue kar raha hu. Lekin jab main padhna shuru karta hu to meri aawaz thodi thodi hilne lagti hai, aur main thoda rukunga aur meri baatein tham jati hai. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki main achi presentations nahi de pa raha hu, aur mere boss ko yeh bhi pasand nahi aa raha hai."
18,"So, so in the moment when you're when it's your turn to present, you're still feeling that same nervousness like that doesn't that doesn't go away at all. And you're trying to hold your body kind of still. Like like almost a cube control. ",symp/reasoning,6_18,T,orq,,"Toh, jab aapko presentation dena hai tab bhi aapko wahi tension hoti hai, jo kabhi kam nahi hoti. Aur aap apne shareer ko thoda sa sambhal kar rakhte hain. Bilkul jaise ek cube ki tarah control karte hain."
19,"Yeah, ",symp/reasoning,6_19,P,od,,"Haan,"
20,"yeah. And then your voice This kind of sounds like crackly or breaking up as you're trying to read from like, bullet points like wanna? ",symp/reasoning,6_20,T,yq,,"haan. phir tumhara awaz chhel chheel jaisa lag raha hai ya phir break ho raha hai jab tum read karne ki koshish kar rahe ho, jaise, bullet points se, kya chahte ho?"
21,"Yeah, ",inactive,6_21,P,ack,,"Haan,"
22,like an outline?,symp/reasoning,6_22,T,crq,,Kya ek kuchh outlines jaldi ban sakti h
23,Yeah.,inactive,6_23,P,cd,,Haan.
24,What happens when you have read the last read last point?,symp/reasoning,6_24,T,irq,,Kya hota hai jab aapne sabse aakhri padha hua point padha hai?
25,"Well when I'm done it's it takes a little bit for everything to calm down. But I I'm, then I'm consumed by the idea that my boss thinks I did a terrible job and that he's, you know, he's regretting putting me in this position and that I can't make good records or you know that I didn't report the right stuff the right information to him and and so, it doesn't really go away. It just it's almost like my mind is shift someone I'm anxious about.",story,6_25,P,id,,"""Theek hai jab tak main kaam nahi khatam kar leta tab tak sab kuch shant nahi hota. Lekin phir bhi main boss ki vajah se pareshaan hun kyunki mujhe lagta hai ki maine bura kaam kiya hai aur wo ab mujhe is position mein laga kar pachhta raha hai aur main achhe records nahi bana sakta ya mujhe sahi information nahi di hai aur aise soch kar mujhe chinta hoti rehti hai."""
26,"Alright, so then the nervousness that's stronger feeling of nervousness that goes away, is replaced by a more general feeling. nervousness about how your how your boss will think of you. Yeah. Because of the presentation quality. ",story,6_26,T,gc,,"Alright, fir uske baad the nervousness jo ek stronger feeling hai aur jo nervousness hai wo to chala jata hoga, replaced ho jayega ek more general feeling se. Nervousness hai teri boss kaapp kya sochega tuke baare mein. Haan. Because abt presentation quality."
27,Yeah.,story,6_27,P,ack,,Haan.
28,"Because as you're presenting and kind of staying still and your voice is crackling, he's picking up on that. And you're aware of that. ",story,6_28,T,crq,,"Because jab tum presentation de rahe ho aur thoda se hi jagah par khade rehte ho aur tumhari awaaz phat rahi hai, woh use samajh gaya. Aur tum is bare mein jaante ho."
29,Yeah.,story,6_29,P,cd,,Haan.
30,"How How long have you noticed? This, these symptoms that appear in this way.",routine,6_30,T,crq,,"Tumhe kitna samay se dhyan aaya hai? Ye, ye lakshan jo is tarah se dikhte hain."
31,"Um, when you when I was an undergrad in college, I had to make some presentations from time to time, and I would get nervous when I would make the presentations. And I just, I mean, most people are afraid of public speaking so like half out that maybe that's what it was. So you know, just doing a presentation in front of like 30 something people and so it didn't really didn't really bother me letters. I figured it was just normal and always got you know, decent grades. On my presentation so it never really bothered me. So I really feel like it's only been an issue in the last few weeks.",symp/reasoning,6_31,P,cd,,"Arey, jab mai college me undergrad tha tab mai kabhi kabhi presentations banana padta tha aur jab bhi mai presentation deta tha to ghabraahat hoti thi. Aur mai, waise toh bahut logo ko public speaking se darr lagta hai isliye shayad meri bhi wahi situation thi. Toh pata nahi, lag raha tha shayad wohi wajah thi. Tu jaante hai, mere saamne 30 se bhi zyada logon ke saamne presentation dene se mujhe koi farak nahi padta tha. Main yahi socha tha ki ye normal hai aur har baar acche marks bhi milte the meri presentations pe, isliye mujhe bahut fark nahi padta tha. Par abhi kuch hi hafton se yehi ek badi mudda ban gaya hai mere liye."
32,The last few weeks is when you notice that we had we had some nervousness before presenting in college but you just kind of thought of it as normal generally impair your ability to present an effect your grades or anything right.,symp/reasoning,6_32,T,orq,,"This last few weeks was the time when you realized that we had some nervousness before presenting in college, but you just thought of it as normal. Generally, it hinders your ability to present and can affect your grades or anything else, right?"
33,Do you have any other symptoms that you think may be related or even unrelated to what's going on?,inactive,6_33,T,crq,,Kya tumhare paas koi aur lakshan hai jiske bare mein tum soch rahe ho jo shayad sambandhit ho ya ho hi na woh jo ho raha hai ke saath?
34,"Um I'm not sure if it if it has any bearing. My my mom, she, she I know she doesn't like to speak in public. And I used to talk to her about how I feel nervous about making presentations. School and, you know, shoots Oh, you can buy it on. It's tiny. And, you know, so I don't know if that means anything.",story,6_34,P,cd,,"Accha main pata nahi ki kya uska kisi prabhav hai. Mere maa toh, woh, woh mujhe pata hai ki voh sabse nahi bolti hai. Aur main unhe apna dar presentations dene se baare mein baat karta tha. School mein aur, pata hai, shoots pe toh Oh, tum kharid sakte ho. Voh bahut chota hai. Aur, pata hai, toh mujhe pata nahi hai ki kya yeh kuchh matlab rakhta hai."
35,"So whatever you have going on, you think that maybe, maybe she has that going on to ",routine,6_35,T,orq,,"Toh tumhare saath jo kuch bhi ho raha hai, tum sochte ho ki shayad wo bhi waisa hi kar rahi hai"
36,maybe,inactive,6_36,P,od,,Ho sakta hai
37,"the same, same set of symptoms, at least.",story,6_37,T,orq,,"Yehi, wahi set of lakshan, kam se kam."
38,"Yeah. I mean, I've asked her, you know, I've told her about this. And she hasn't been in a situation where she's had to, to do this kind of presentations, like in a small group like this. And so I don't, I can't compare it to that. But I mean, she has said that she's gotten nervous before.",story,6_38,T,od,,"Haan. Mainey ussey kaha hai, tum jaanti ho, mainey isskey baarey mein batta diya hai. Aur woh issey laagey nahi ki woh ek aisi sthiti mein thi jahan woh iss tarah ki presentations karna padi ho, jaisey ki issey choti si group mein, jaisey ki yeh. Aur iss tarah se mujhe uss sey tulna nahi kar sakti. Lekin mainey yeh kaha hai ki woh pehle bhi nervous ho gayi hai."
39,Any feelings of sadness or anything like that?,routine,6_39,T,irq,,Kya tumhe dukh ya uske jaise kuch bhi mahsoos ho raha hai?
40,"Yeah, like after I do after I make the presentation at work, and then I do start feeling really sad. You know, like I said, because then I feel like my boss isn't satisfied with my performance and that he's gonna regret his decision to give me this position. And so yeah, it definitely makes me sad. I feel disappointed in myself.",story,6_40,P,id,,"Haan, jaise hi main kaam pe presentation bana kar karke, aur fir main bohot hi dukhi mehsoos karti hoon. Pata hai, jaise maine kaha, kyunki phir mujhe lagta hai ki mera boss meri performance se khush nahi hai aur unhe apni yeh faisla par afsos hoga ki unhone mujhe yeh position di. Aur isi liye haan, yeh meri kushalata mein nirasha paida karta hai."
41,"Do you have any substance use going on alcohol, anything else?",symp/reasoning,6_41,T,irq,,"क्या आपको कोई नशीली चीज़ का उपयोग होता है, जैसे शर"
42,And now I have a drink every now and then it's very very rare,symp/reasoning,6_42,P,id,,और अब मुझे अब-अब पीने की आदत है लेकिन यह बहुत ही ज़्यादा रार है
43,"and in these I know this is something recent for you but in these meetings so far, has the nervousness ever caused you to leave the room before they came around to your turn?",symp/reasoning,6_43,T,crq,,"Aur isme main jaanta hoon ki yeh aapke liye abhi hal hi mein ek naya cheez hai, lekin ab tak ki meetings mein kya kabhi aapko itni ghabrahat hui hai ki aap apni baari aane se pehle kamre se nikal gaye?"
44,"No, no, I've I've managed to control it, I guess to where I can stay there. Like I said, I've kind of zoned out some times when other people have been presenting and I feel bad about that too because I feel like they have important information to share with me and I should give them the same respect of paying attention but I'd become focused on on on what's going on inside like my heart eating and the you know, my hands and so I can't I zone out on them sometimes, but But no, I I pushed through it and I do my presentation.",story,6_44,P,cd,,"Na, na, maine apne aap ko control kar liya hai, shayad jahan tak main wahin reh sakta hoon. Jaise maine kaha tha, kabhi-kabhi main dusre logon ke presentation ke samay nahi sunnta aur usske liye mujhe bura lagta hai kyunki maine unki taraf dhyan dene ke liye zaroori jankari hai aur main unhe utna hi samman deta hoon lekin main apne dil mein chal rahi baat aur haatho par dhyan concentrate ho jata hai, isliye kabhi-kabhi main unko dhyan nahi deta. Lekin no, maine iss se ladkar apna presentation ko accomplish kiya hai."
45,Are you ever worried about what they're thinking about? She mentioned what your boss could be thinking about you ever worried about what the other workers at the table thinking about?,story,6_45,T,crq,,Kya tum kabhi sochte ho ki wo kya soch rahe honge? Usne mention kiya ki tumhare boss tumhare baare mein kya soch sakte hain. Kya tum kabhi chinta karte ho ki table par dusre kaamgar kya soch rahe honge?
46,"Yeah, times cuz I feel like you know I'm the newest member of the management team and so I feel like they're kinda like what is up with this chick? I can't she get it together but you know there's there's been one person who's been really supportive and you know, she's been like, Hey, you did great today and great information and things like that. So that kind of helps me feel better. But I guess at the end of the day to me, it's really my boss's opinion that matters because he's my boss.",story,6_46,P,cd,,"""Haan, times ke reason se mujhe lagta hai aapko pata hai main management team ka sabse naya member hun, aur isliye to mujhe lag raha hai ki woh thoda sa confuse hai, yeh ladki kaun hai? Lekin maine yeh socha nahe tha ki woh ek insaan honge jo mujhe support karenge, aur aapko pata hai woh bolegi, Aur mere liye yeh kaafi madadgar hai jab woh kehte hain, Aaj aapne bahut achha kaam kiya aur bade bhrosa ke saath aur aur aise cheezen. Isliye mujhe thoda acha lagta hai. Lekin mujhe lagta hai, mujhe apne boss ki opinion zyada maayne rakhta hai kyunki woh mere boss hain."""
47,"Have you ever felt you mentioned you're nervous at the beginning of the meeting? Have you ever felt nervous? well in advance of the meeting,",symp/reasoning,6_47,T,crq,,क्या आपने कभी अनुभव किया है कि आपने मीटिंग की शुरुआत में अपनी घबराहट को ज़ाहिर किया था? क्या आपने कभी घबराहट महसूस की है? मी
48,"I'm when I'm preparing Like that morning to go to work, and that's one of those like, Okay, I got this meeting at nine. And I start to think about I like on my way into work and but I don't, I don't start feeling anything until I'm actually in the room.",symp/reasoning,6_48,P,cd,,"Main jab apne kaam ke liye tayyar hota hu, tab mere dimaag mein yeh baat aati hai ki mujhe subah ka meeting hai. Aur main sochne lagta hu ki kaam par jaate hue mujhe kaisa lagega. Lekin sach me mujhe kuch ehsaas tab hota hai jab main khud kamre mein enter karta hu."
49,"So have you noticed nervousness, fairly intense? Pretty much only at these meetings. It's been bothering you for a few weeks. something new, something a little frightening for you. We'll get you set up with treatment. I'll get you in to see somebody in next few days. If that works for you. ",routine,6_49,T,gc,,"Kya tereko dikh raha hai kuch ghabraahat, kaafi zyada? Thoda bas tumhi ke meetings mein? Yeh kuch hafton se pareshaan kar raha hai? Kuch naya, thoda daraavna? Hum tujhe ilaaj ke saath set kar denge. Hum tujhe kisi se milane ke liye kara denge agle kuch dino mein. Tere liye agar kaam kare toh."
