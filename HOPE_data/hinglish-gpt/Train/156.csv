Well, you know, last time that we met you had talked about how important it is for you to do what you can to keep your kids and yourself safe. And I was wondering if you'd be interested in talking a little bit more about that today? Or perhaps if there's something else that you would rather talk about",routine,156_16,T,gc,0.0,"Mujhe sachmuch aapke aaj aane ke liye bahut abhari hun, aapko itna kaam aur busy hone ke baad bhi. Accha, aapko pata hai, jab hum pehle mile the, tab aapne bataya tha ki aapke liye kitna mahatvapurn hai ki aap apne baccho aur khud ko surakshit rakhe.

Mujhe lagta hai ki yeh bahut mahatvapurn hai ki koshish karein kuchh suljhane ki kyonki haalaat vahan se behad kharab ho gaye they. Aur isliye main sochkar aage badhne ka intezaar kar raha hoon ki main kya-kya kar sakti hoon."
18,"So, so you were scared. It sounds like you were scared. ",routine,156_18,T,crq,0.0,"To, to tum dar gaye the. Yeh sunke lagta hai ki tum dar gaye the."

And it's, it's it was just very scary.",symp/reasoning,156_19,P,cd,-2.0,"Yeh darawana tha. I mean, hum police ko bulaya tha, pata hai, hume fir se police ko bulana pada. Aur Paul ko giraftaar kiya gaya aur usne kuch samay jail mein bitaya. Mere ghar par Child Welfare ke log ghum rahe the aur meri maa pareshan thi aur padosi sab taush se pahunch rahe the aur chugli kar rahe the. Aur yeh, yeh bahut daarawani tha."
20,"So so a lot of things were turned upside down. And when you say it was scary, I hear you saying on some level was scary for you and your your safety but it also sounds like it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive,",routine,156_20,T,gc,0.0,"So so bahut saari cheezen ulte ho gayi thi. Aur jab tum kahte ho ki yeh daravna tha, mujhe yeh lagta hai ki tum apne suraksha ke liye dar rahe the lekin woh bhi sunai deta hai ki yeh dar tab bhi tha kyunki saare aur bhi aseem prabhav ya taatke ucchal diye gaye the."
21,"right? I mean, it was, you know, we had people come into the house calling and you know, checking in, are you okay? Or can you get a restraining order and my mom was trying to get me to move in with her and you know, it's just too many, you know, too many cooks in the kitchen.",symp/reasoning,156_21,P,gc,-2.0,"Sahi na? Matlab, humare yahan log ghar mein aa rahe the aur puch rahe the, tum theek ho? Kya tum ek kareebi hukum se rok sakthi ho aur meri maa mujhe apne saath rahne ke liye persuade kar rahi thi aur pata hai, ghar mein itne saare log kaafi confusing ho jaata hai."

They were holding his arms behind his back and They have their guns and you know that kind of you never know what the police are going to do to a black man. You never know whether he's going to make it to the jail safely. So I was I was terrified for him. And then the next day, you know, Child Welfare call in the house.",symp/reasoning,156_25,P,gc,-2.0,"Vo apna gun chalake use zameen par feka ja rae the. Unhone uske haath piche bandhe hue the aur vo unke saath apne gun the aur tu toh jaante hi hai ke police kisi kaale insaan ke saath kya karti hai. Kabhi pata nahi hota ke vo jail tak bina koi pareshani ke pahunch paega ya nahi. Mere liye bhi vo darawna tha. Aur phir agle din, pata chala ke Child Welfare ne ghar mein call kiya hai."

And so I've been thinking about what kinds of things I could do if things are crazy and out of control. And I've just thought about maybe talking to somebody or talking to my minister about it was came to my mind because he's somebody who we've talked to before.,symp/reasoning,156_35,P,cd,-2.0,Mujhe lagta hai ki main sabse zyada darr raha hun. Ise hai pata ki kuch ho sakta hai jo sachmuch pagal aur poore taabre se bahar ho. Isliye main sochta raha hun ki agar sab tabahi aur baat ka bahaar ho jaaye to main kya kar sakta hun. Aur mujhe bas ye khayal aaya ki shayad kisi se baat karna ya apne wazira yaad mujhe iske baare mein baat karna aaya kyunki woh toh voh aadmi hain jisse pehle bhi hum baat ki thi.

39,"I'm really, I'm really interested in telling him more of the truth of what's happening in my relationship he doesn't know about He has no idea that Paul has threatened to kill me. And then he's starting to kill himself and the children. He knows we've had some marital problems, some financial problems. He knows that Paul's had some drinking problems. So there's some of that, but he doesn't know about him threatening to kill us or that he's been hitting me or his rages. So I feel like, you know, that it's time to tell them, you know, tell him some of that stuff.",symp/reasoning,156_39,P,od,-2.0,"Main sach mein, main usse apni rishte ke haalat aur humare beech ho rahe halaat ki sachchai batane mein dilchaspi rakhta hun.

Usse ye pata hai ki humare beech me shaadi se judi kuch problems hain, kuch paise ki takleef hai. Usse ye bhi pata hai ki Paul ki maikeena pareshani hai. Lekin usse pata nahi hai ki wo hume marne ki dhamki deta hai ya mujhe maarta hai ya fir uske gusse ke bare mein. Isliye mujhe lagta hai ki ab wo sab kuch usse batane ka waqt aa gaya hai."

And he has been very helpful to someone that you trust someone that you have a relationship with, and he's been helpful in what ways is he been helpful? You know, I think Paul respects him as a man. And I think he cares about Paul. So he's not you know, my mom and my dad and my friends. They they're they're really bordering on hating Paul. And they don't. I don't feel like they have any objectivity when it comes to working with him that my pastor has some objectivity. And I think he cares about Paul,",story,156_41,P,id,-1.0,"Usne pahle se hi madad kar rahe hain, wah hamari bahut madad ki hai. Hamne uske saath pichhle paanch saal me anek baar counselling ki hai.

And you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that as well. What would be another reason to talk to your pastor, in addition to this being someone you trust, and that Paul might listen to what would be another ",routine,156_42,T,gc,0.0,"Lagta hai ke aapke pastors use ek poora aur complicated insaan ke roop mein dekh sakte hain, waise hi jaise ki aap karte hain shayad, ki usme ek aisa hissa hai jo daravna hai aur aapko pasand nahi hai, aur ek aisa hissa hai jo aap sach mein saraha hai.

66,"Yeah. And as he's becoming a man and thinking about how to protect you, you're also really concerned about protecting him and keeping him safe. And I've heard you identify a few things that you're thinking about doing or would like to do. And things that you feel like you actually do have control over. Last time we talked to you, you were very clear about the fact that you can't control Paul, when he's in his fear and his rage and being violent. And what I've heard you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control. You can't control him, but there are some things you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to possibly a safe person, your minister. ",routine,156_66,T,id,0.0,"Arre! Aur jab voh ek ladka ho jata hai aur tumhare suraksha ka vichar karta hai, toh tum bhi uski suraksha ke baare mein chinta karne lagte ho. Aur maine suna hai ki tum kuch cheezein karne ka ya karne ki ichha rakhte ho. Aur voh cheezein hai jin par tumhe lagta hai ki tumhe sach mein kabu hai. Pichhli baar jab hum tumse baat kiye the, tum vaise bhi bahut saaf dhang se bol chuke the ki tum Paul ko kabhi kabu nahi kar sakte, jab voh darta hai, gussa karta hai aur hinsak ho jata hai. Aur maine bahut saaf suna hai ki tumhe apne haath mein kuch control chahiye. Tum usse nahi, lekin tumhare paas kuch cheezein control mein hai, aur specifically tumhare liye voh hai ki, shayad kisi surakshit vyakti se baat karna, tumhare maulvi se."
