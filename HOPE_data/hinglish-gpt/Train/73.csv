0,"So Tommy, I wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures from a party you were at and made me a little bit concerned because I saw you were drinking and I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits in your life.",symp/reasoning,73_0,T,irq,,"Toh Tommy, maine tujhse baat karni thi kyunki Facebook pe kal maine kuch tasveerein dekhi thi jisme tujhe ek party mein dekha gaya tha aur mujhe thoda chinta hui kyunki maine dekha ki tu peete hue tha. Mujhe yeh jaanne mein ruchi hai ke tere zindagi mein sharab kaise fit hai."
1,I mainly just drink whenever I'm at parties or whenever somebody hands me a beer i'll i'll take sips every now and then. But it's not something that I feel hovers around my life.,symp/reasoning,73_1,P,id,,Mainly mein parties par hi peeta hun ya jab koi mujhe beer dete hain tab mein kabhi kabhi ek sip leta hun. Lekin yeh meri zindagi ko gherne wali koi cheez nahi lagti.
2,It's kind of a social thing for you not like a major priority. Yeah. How much do you think you're drinking?,symp/reasoning,73_2,T,irq,,"Ye thoda sa social hai tumhare liye, major priority jaise nahi hai. Haan. Tum kitna pi rahi ho?"
3,"I guess I would say like every other every other weekend, maybe every every two weeks. On occasion, maybe There's a basketball game going on or a football game I'll have a beer just to drink with my boys. But other than that, I don't really see it as much of a of a problem.",story,73_3,P,id,,"Main aisa hi kehunga jaise har baar ya har do hafte mein, doosre weekends ki tarah. Kabhi kabhi, shayad koi basketball match chal raha ho ya football game, main aur mere yaaro ke saath beer peeke nasha karta hoon. Par bad mein, mujhe kuch bhi dikhai nahi deta ki yeh ek badi pareshaani hai."
4,So you're drinking maybe half the time depending on what's going on that weekend.,symp/reasoning,73_4,T,crq,,"Tum shayad, jis hafte ki charcha ho rahi hai, uss vikend par aadhe samay ke liye sharab pi rahe ho."
5,"Yeah, I guess you can say that.",routine,73_5,P,cd,,"Haan, main kuch keh sakti hoon."
6,"Well, how would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you don't?",symp/reasoning,73_6,T,irq,,"वैसे, आप अगर तारीख़ न लें, तो आपको अलग दिनों की अलग आदतों के बारे में कैसे व्य"
7,"When I'm not drinking, I'm usually more like, involved in doing like more productive things like I I try and do more schoolwork whenever I have the time or whenever I like I can go workout or something just to like, when whenever I'm drinking, I devote my time to just letting loose and having fun and just relaxing with friends. Okay,",story,73_7,P,id,,"Jab main nashay ki aadat nahi karti hoon, tab main aamtaur par adhik utaarte hue, padhai jaise uljhe hue kaam mein jyada doobi rehti hoon. Jab bhi mera samay ho, ya jab meri saan de rahe ho, main apni aadat ke sath saath padhai bhi karne ki koshish karti hoon. Ya phir main vyayam jaa sakti hoon ya koi aur cheez karti hoon, bas aise hi, jab main nashay se door hu, to apna samay khoob saath mere doston ke saath masti karne mein vyateet karti hoon aur aise hi thoda relax ho jaati hoon. Achha,"
8,"so you you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends. When Don't drink, but maybe you don't feel like you can relax as well.",symp/reasoning,73_8,T,crq,,"So, kya tumhe lagta hai ki tum weekends par zyada kaam kar lete ho. Jab tum peete nahi ho, lekin shayad tumhe lagta hoga ki tum utna hi aaram se nahi reh sakte."
9,"Yeah, I mean, I, whenever I'm drinking, I know that I'm devoting time to, to not doing other things. So I try and make it so that I don't allow myself to pile on so much work. So I try and, like get work done before, but I know that drinking gets in the way of productivity. So I try and minimize that as much as possible.",story,73_9,P,cd,,"Haan, main to yehi matlab tha, ki main jab bhi pee raha hoon, tab main jaanta hoon ki main apna samay kisi aur kaam pe nahi laga raha hoon. To main koshish karta hoon ki pee lena se pehle main apna kaam pura kar loon, lekin pata hai ki sharab productivity ko rok deti hai. Isliye main usko jitna ho sake kam karne ki koshish karta hoon."
10,You're trying to be responsible and get your stuff done. Yeah. Knowing that the drinking is gonna make it harder. Yeah. Okay. And it sounds like are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink?,routine,73_10,T,crq,,Tum jimmedar banna chahte ho aur aap apne kaam khatm karne ki koshish kar rahe ho. Haan. Jaante hue ki peene se ye mushkil hojayega. Haan. Theek hai. Lag raha hai ki kya tum sab kaam kar rahe ho ya kuch kaam peena ke wajah se tumse chhut gaya hai?
11,"Yeah, I guess when I drink some things do slip a little bit. But just because like when I'm drinking, I'm, I'm not really focused on what I have to do. I'm focused on the moment and just enjoying the time that I have at that time. And it's really something that I just it's something of an like a pleasure givers like and enjoying a joint enjoyment type of thing.",story,73_11,P,cd,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai jab main kuch pee leta hoon to kuch cheezein thoda sa slip ho jaati hain. Lekin bas isliye kyunki jab main pee raha hoon, main sach mein apne kaam pe dhyaan nahi de raha hoon. Main moment pe focus kar raha hoon aur woh waqt mahool ko sukhad bana raha hai. Aur yeh sach mein ek aisi cheez hai jo mujhe khushi dene wali hai, ek aish ka anand dene wali cheez hai."
12,What are the things you enjoy about the drinking?,symp/reasoning,73_12,T,irq,,Tum kya cheezo se sharab peene me anand lete ho?
13,"Just the way that it, it's sort of like liberates you and makes you it makes you feel like a more confident, more energetic person that you don't feel like yourself you feel like a different version of yourself. And it's something that you it, it's just empowering to a degree.",story,73_13,P,id,,"hinglish

Bas vahi tarika hai ki, yeh thoda saa liberate karta hai aur tumhe ek confident aur energy se bhara insaan banaata hai. Tum khud ki tarah nahi, bilkul alag ek roop mein mehsoos ho. Aur yeh kuch cheez hai jo, tumhe bas ek had tak empowered banata hai."
14,"Okay. So you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways? Yeah? Okay, are there any not so good things about drinking.",routine,73_14,T,irq,,"Theek hai. Toh kya tum khulke mahsoos kar rahe ho ya kuch tareeko se zyada confident ho rahe ho? Haan? Theek hai, kya koi aisi baatein hai peene ke baare mein jo thodi si bure ho?"
15,"Um, whenever I drink too much, I sort of lose control of myself and I I just like the aftermath of whenever I drank too much or whenever my friends mixed drinks and it just has a harmful effect on my body. That's probably one of the major drawbacks that I had from drinking.",story,73_15,P,id,,"""Madam ji, jab main zyada peeta hoon, to main apne aap ko control karne mein mushkil ho jaata hoon aur main sirf us baad ka achha nahin lagta jab maine zyada pee li thi ya jab mere doston ne drinks mix kiya thi, aur yeh meri sehat par bura asar daalta hai. Yeh shayad meri peene ke ek bade nuksaan mein se hain."""
16,What kinds of things happen?,routine,73_16,T,irq,,Kya kya tarah ki cheezen ghatit hoti hai?
17,"I mainly when when I puke or it's just the the feeling that I get in my stomach, if I drink too much is just very overwhelming.",symp/reasoning,73_17,P,id,,"मैं मुख उन्हालु करती हूँ जब कि मैं ज़्यादा पीती हूँ या जब मेरे पेट में लगातार दर्द होता है, या फिर सिर्फ वह एहसास होता है कि मेरे पेट में ब"
18,"Like you notice in your body, how much do you think is the most you've ever drank in one time?",symp/reasoning,73_18,T,irq,,"Tum apne body mein itna notice karte ho, ek baar mein sabse jyada kitna piya hai tumne?"
19,"Wow, I would say probably",story,73_19,P,id,,"Wow, mai to kehsakta hu shayad"
20,"at a friend, one of my friends had a birthday party recently. And he wanted to let loose was it was just the all the guys were together and they had a couple of friends over and it just turned into one big party and I just I lost it. I drank way too much I would say like probably a bottle or two and just some beers along the way. I got to a point where I lost count",story,73_20,P,id,,"Apne ek dost ke ghar, meri ek dost ki birthday party haal hi mein thi. Aur usne ekdum masti ki, kyuki sab ladke saath mein the aur kuch dost bhi aa gaye the, aur phir wohi safarik romantic night ban gayi. Aur maine peeke toh dekho, mujhe toh pata hi nahi tha. Main shayad ek ya do bottle aur kuch beer pi chuka tha. Aur phir woh din mera itna bada geet ho gaya ki main apne hisab se gin nahi paya."
21,"that was out of the ordinary For you to discount, what's a more typical amount that you drink?",routine,73_21,T,irq,,"That was bahar se ajeeb hai For you to discount, kya aap normally kitna piyete ho?"
22,"I don't let myself drink more than three or four beers on a given night. Just because I know I'm, I've gotten to the point where I sort of know my limit. But I kind of flirt with my limit just to see how far I can go. And I think that that sort of is very dangerous to play with fire, but I want to see how far I can go. Just so I know not to go that far.",story,73_22,P,id,,"Main apne aap ko ek raat mein teen ya chaar beer se zyada nahi peene deta. Bas isliye ki main jaanta hoon ki main us had tak pahunch chuka hoon jahan main apni had ka andaza kuchh had tak lagaa sakta hoon. Lekin main apne had se thoda khelna chahta hoon, bas dekhne ke liye ki main kitna door ja sakta hoon. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki ye, aag ke saath khelna bilkul khatarnak hai, lekin main dekhna chahta hoon ki main kitna door ja sakta hoon. Bus main jaan loon ki itna door na jao."
23,Got it. So you're you're sort of testing and pushing it in. Yeah. And sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequences that you mentioned.,routine,73_23,T,op,,Samajh liya. To tu thoda sa test kar raha hai aur use push kar raha hai. Haan. Aur kabhi-kabhi us had tak jaakar karne se kuchh consequences hote hai jinko tune mention kiya hai.
24,"Yeah, just so I know how it feels now so that later on when this The situation is more drastic and more out of control. I know what I can do and where am I limit is it you?",routine,73_24,P,cr,,"Haan, main bas yeh jaan lu ki woh kaisa lagta hai abhi, taaki baad mein jab yeh situation zyada gambheer aur zyada bahar se sambhaala na jaaye, toh main jaan lu ki main kya kar sakti hu aur meri had kya hai aapki taraf se?"
25,"Well, kind of along those lines Looking ahead, you know, five years from now, what do you see as a goal for yourself",routine,73_25,T,gc,,"Accha, aise hi kuch hai Look karte hue, aage dekh raha hai na, paanch saalon ke baad, tum apne liye ek lakshya kya dekhte ho?"
26,"in terms of career wise, in terms",routine,73_26,P,gc,,"कैरियर की दृष्टि से, दृष्टि से"
27,"of what do you think you'll be doing in five years,",routine,73_27,T,orq,,Tum sochte ho ki paanch saal mein tum kya kar rahe ho?
28,and I would love to be.,routine,73_28,P,od,,aur mai bechara hona pasand karunga.
29,"I would love to travel, I would love to see the world for what it is. And I've always seen pictures and videos of how the world is, but I've never really experienced that, like, I've always wanted to travel to Europe or, or China or something or someplace like that. So I can really experience the world",story,73_29,P,od,,"मैं यात्रा करने के लिए बहुत प्यार करूंगा, मैं दुनिया को उसकी असलियत में देखने के लिए प्यार करूंगा। और मैं हमेशा दुनिया के बारे में तस्वीरें और वीडियो देखता रहा हूं, लेकिन मैंने कभी वास्तव में वह अनुभव नहीं किया है, जैसे, मैं हमेशा चाहता था कि यूरोप या, या चीन या कुछ अन्य जगह पर यात्रा करूं। त"
30,that we live in.,routine,73_30,P,od,,ki hum rahte hai.
31,"So getting a full experience is really important, too. It sounds like throughout your life, you know, you talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience. And now you're looking at how you can enrich your life in other ways. How do you think drinking too much would fit into, you know, being able to experience life to its fullest?",story,73_31,T,od,,"Toh ek complete anubhav lena bahut mahatvapurn hai, samajhne mein bhi jo mushkil ho sakti hai. Lagta hai ki tumhare jeevan bhar mein, tumne high school anubhav ko behtar banane ki charcha ki. Aur ab tum apni zindagi ko aur bhi behtar banane ke liye soch rahe ho. Tumhe lagta hai ki jyada peene se zindagi ko poori tarah se jeene mein kahan fit hoga?"
32,"I guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel the effects of living life to the fullest. But I wouldn't want to tamper with drinking too much. Like, often, just because I'm I know, I've seen the consequences that drinking has on people and I know that I would never want to get to a degree where I need to drink constantly, every single day. I don't want to ever get to that point. ",story,73_32,P,gc,,"मुझे लगता है कि यह मुझे जीवन को पूरी तरह से जीने के प्रभाव को महसूस करने से बाधित कर सकता है। लेकिन मैं ज्यादा पीने से सुनिश्चित रूप से ही भी मत चाहूंगा। ऐसा नहीं कि मैं हर दिन अपने आप को पीने की आवश्यकता होती है, बस क्योंकि मैं जानता हूं कि अन्य लोगों पर पीने का असर क्या होता है और मैं कभी भी उस स्तर तक पहुंचना नहीं चाहता हूं जहां मुझे लगे कि मैं हर दिन पीने की जरूरत होती है। मैं उस स्थिति तक"
33,"Okay. So just to kind of summarize what you've told me so far, you're you're drinking pretty regularly, but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you're having some of these negative consequences. And you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less,",routine,73_33,T,crq,,"Thik hai. Toh main thoda sa saar samajh loon, tu regular pee raha hai, par tu khud ko limit karna ki koshish kar raha hai, tu lag raha hai ki maybe teen drink hi zyada ho jaate hain jo tu pee sakta hai tab tak tab jab negative asar shuru ho jaate hain. Aur tu ko apni intihaan teen ya usse kam karne se accha lagta hai."
34,"yeah, feel more in control",routine,73_34,P,cd,,"haan, mujhe zyada control mein mehsoos ho raha hai."
35,"and then kind of looking ahead. You don't want to Find yourself being someone who's drinking all the time or someone who feels out of control with their drinking that you've seen that maybe in other people's lives, and it's not appealing to at all. And and you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve, that drinking too much could also interfere with. So where do you think you want to go from here with with regard to your drinking?",story,73_35,T,irq,,"Fir yeh dekhte hue aage badhte hain. Aap chahte nahin ki aap khud ko aisa vyakti paaye joki hamesha peeta ho ya jiski peene ki aadat khud se bahar ho jaaye, aapne dekha hoga ki dusron ki zindagi mein aisa hota hai, aur yeh bilkul bhi kheech nahin lagta. Aur aapki zindagi ke liye bade bade lakshya hain jinhe aap haasil karna chahte hain, lekin zyada peene se bhi yeh bich mein aa sakta hai. To aapko lagta hai aap yahan se apni peene ki taraf kahan jaana chahte hain?"
36,"Maybe now that I know, my limits to an extent, I kind of don't want to push it. So, so much. Now that I know what I can do and where I can go. I would like to mitigate that as much as possible. I just want to I want to have fun being me. But I don't want me to be influenced by alcohol. So much. Like I want to live the sober life to an extent, but I know that alcohol is just gonna tamper with it.",story,73_36,P,od,,"Shayad ab jab mujhe pata chal gaya hai, meri hadon ki had ko, main kuch zyada nahi dabana chahta. Yani, bahut zyada. Ab jab mujhe pata chal gaya hai ki main kya kar sakta hoon aur kahan jaa sakta hoon. Main chahta hoon ki main usko kam se kam kar doon. Bas main chahta hoon ki main maza karoon apne aap mein. Lekin main chahta hoon ki alcohol mujh par asar na dale. Bahut zyada. Jaise main sober zindagi jeena chahta hoon, lekin mujhe pata hai ki alcohol usmein ghusa dega."
37,"So for right now It feels like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you're, you're stopping three, for example, or maybe even limiting the number of times that you're drinking.",symp/reasoning,73_37,T,gc,,"Abhi abhi itna feel ho ra hai ki tere liye ek sahi target hai ki thoda apne drinking ko limit kar kar aur dhyaan de ke tu, tu teen baar ki jagah rok de, jaise jaise ki tu pine ki sankhya ko limit kare."
38,"Yeah. And like not, like not drinking, like in the mornings or just just strictly for social purposes like not just to not have it around, like, I don't want to have it like in my fridge, if my parents have it. I don't want to I don't want to have to deal with it. ",symp/reasoning,73_38,P,gc,,"Haan. Aur jaise hi, jaise subahs ko ya sirf dosti ke maqsad ke liye nahi peenaa, jaise mere fridge mein nahi rehne dena, jaise, mujhe nahi chahiye ki mere parivaar mein hai toh mujhe uske saath deal karna pade."

And I think that by not drinking, I will definitely have a better effect on my life.",story,73_42,P,id,,"मुझे लगता है कि मैं निश्चित रूप से एक बेहतर जीवन जी सकती हूं, काफी तदात्मक तरीके से जहां मैं अपने काम में अधिक उत्तम और अधिक कुशल हो सकती हूं और जहां मैं अपने जीवन के अगले कुछ साल में हो सकती हूं। और मुझे लगता है कि शराब न पीने से मेरे जीवन पर निश्चित रूप से अधिक असर होगा।"
43,"Yeah, I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea. And I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest question. You know, if you don't mind, I would like to talk to probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months and just kind of check in how things are going. Right. All right. Sounds good. ",routine,73_43,T,gc,,"Haan, main sochta hoon ke apne peene par hadh badhane aur kam karne ke liye kadam uthana bahut hi acha vichaar hai. Aur main aapko is baare mein baat karne aur khule aur imaandaar sawal poonchne ke liye shukriya ada karta hoon. Pata hai, agar aapko koi baat na bane toh, main chahunga ke ham is bare mein kuch hafton ya kuch mahinon baad baat karein aur dekhein ke haalat kaise hain. Tikka. Theek hai. Sunaiye."
