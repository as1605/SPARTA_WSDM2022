1,"Well, you can call me Barbara. That'll be fine. ",inactive,207_1,P,gt,,"Toh, tum mujhe Barbara keh sakte ho. Vo thik hoga."
2,"Okay, that's fine. Okay, so, Barbara, I'm seeing you today. But I think it's usually Dr. Brown that sees you. Is that right?",inactive,207_2,T,gt,,"Okay, thik hai. Okay, toh, Barbara, aaj main tumhe dekh raha hoon. Par mujhe lagta hai ki normally Dr. Brown tumhe dekhta hai. Kya ye sahi hai?"
3,Yes. Dr. Brown is my doctor.,routine,207_3,P,id,,Haan. Dr. Brown meri doctor hai.
4,Okay. What is it this boy you see me today?,routine,207_4,T,irq,,Theek. Aaj maine tujhe ye ladka dikhaaya?
5,"Well, I've come about my tummy problem. I've got terrible trouble with my stomach. And Dr. Brown just doesn't seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. I thought perhaps I'd come and see you to see if you could help.",symp/reasoning,207_5,P,id,,"Arey, meri pet ki problem ke baare mein hai. Meri pet mein bahut zyada takleef hai. Aur Dr. Brown ko iska hal nahi mil raha hai. Main socha ki shayad main aapko dekhne aau taki aap meri madad kar sake."
6,Right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems?,routine,207_6,T,irq,,Right. Thik hai. Kya aap mujhe apne pet ki pareshaniyon ke baare mein thoda aur bata sakte hain?
7,"Umm Well, I have this terrible discomfort nearly all the time. It very often feels bloated. I I swing between being constipated and having diarrhea. I have sort of cramping feelings sometimes and other times it stops. It's a real stabbing feeling. I often have the urge to go to the toilet, and and I pass very smelly wind.",symp/reasoning,207_7,P,id,,"Arre yaar, Mujhe almost hamesha ye dukh hota hai. Yeh bahut baar phool si jaati hai. Kabhi kabhi mujhe dard sa ho jata hai aur kabhi ruk jata hai. Yeh sach me karane waali si feeling hai. Main to dhakke khaane ke liye toilet jaane ki ichcha rakhta hoon aur aur main baarik gandh wala gast held hun."
8,So quite a few symptoms and some of them sound more troublesome to you.,routine,207_8,T,crq,,ठीक है तो काफी कुछ लक्षण हैं और कुछ ऐसे हैं जो आपको और परेशानी
9,Yes. Okay.,inactive,207_9,P,ack,,Haan. Thik hai.
10,And how long has this been going on?,symp/reasoning,207_10,T,irq,,Aur ye chal raha hai kab se?
11,"Well, I I've traced it back to a holiday I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had a horrible bout of sickness and diarrhea And I don't think my stomach's ever been really right since then.",symp/reasoning,207_11,P,id,,"Well, I I've traced it back to a vacation I had in Egypt about four years ago. I had a terrible case of vomiting and loose motions And I don't think my tummy's ever been completely fine since then."
12,Okay. Okay. So you think it began about four years ago after this holiday?,routine,207_12,T,yq,,Theek hai. Theek hai. Toh aapko yeh char saal pehle chutti ke baad shuru hua lagra hai?
13,"Yes,Yes.",routine,207_13,P,ack,,"Haan,"
14,Okay.And What sort of treatments have you tried for this before?,symp/reasoning,207_14,T,irq,,Thik hai. Aur aapne iske liye pehle kaun se ilaaj try kiye hain?
15,"Well, Dr. Brown gave me some muscle relaxants at the beginning. But I've been to the health shop and and they've been really helpful. They've given me lots of different tablets and medicines for different things. Now oh and Imodium, I have Imodium in my hand back all the time, just in case, right.",symp/reasoning,207_15,P,id,,"""Arre, Dr. Brown ne mujhe shuruat mein kuch muscle relaxants diye the. Par main health shop gaya hoon aur woh mujhe bada sa madicines deke bohut help kiye hai. Unhone mujhe alag-alag cheezon ke liye bohut saare tablets aur dawaiyaan di hai. Ab dekho, Imodium, mere pass hamesha haath me rehta hai, bas bachane ke liye, thik hai."""
16,"So these different tablets that you've got from the herbal shop, how are you taking them? ",routine,207_16,T,irq,,"Toh yeh alag-alag tablets jo aapne herbal shop se liye hain, aap unhe kaise le rahe hain?"
17,"Oh, well, different tablets. You know, I don't have the same problem every day. So I'll take some tablets for certain symptoms, right. Other tablets for other things.",symp/reasoning,207_17,P,id,,"Oh, well, humare paas alag-alag goliyan hain. Aap jante hain, har din humein wahi problem nahi hoti. Isliye main kuch goliyan leta hoon kuch specific lakshano ke liye. Aur kuch goliyan dusre cheezein ke liye."
18,"So my my writing thinking you perhaps decide on a day to day basis, what you're going to take depending on what your stomach's doing. ",inactive,207_18,T,yq,,"Aise mai mere khayal mai likh rahi thi, shayad tum roz roz apne khaane ke hisaab se decide karte ho ki tum kya lenge, apne pet ke haalat ke hisaab se."
19,Yeah,inactive,207_19,P,ack,,Haan
20,okay. Okay. And what About tests if you have any tests for these problems.,symp/reasoning,207_20,T,irq,,Okay. Okay. Aur yeh problems ke liye agar koi tests hai toh kya?
21,"Yes, I had in the early days, I had a gastros,, guess. ",symp/reasoning,207_21,P,id,,"Ha, yes, I had in the early days, I had a gastros, guess."
22,they're are the gastroscopy?,inactive,207_22,T,crq,,Kya woh gastroscopy karwa sakte hain?
23,"yes, And at the same time, I had a barium enema, right, that was very uncomfortable. ",symp/reasoning,207_23,P,cd,,"Haan, aur us samay, mere paas ek barium enema hua tha, sahi, jo bada uncomfortable tha."
24,Okay.,inactive,207_24,T,ack,,"Thik,"
25,"But now I've tried you. I don't think he's tried enough tests because he said after that, that they didn't find anything. He's, he's just not sent me for anymore. That's it now, as far as he's concerned, sent me back to the doctor.",inactive,207_25,P,cd,,"Lekin jabse maine tujhe try kiya hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki usne kaafi kam tests try kiye hai kyunki usne baad mein kaha ki unhone kuch bhi nahi paaya. Usne bas mujhe kisi aur ke paas bheja hai. Ab uske liye yahi khatam hai, mujhe dobara doctor ke paas bhej diya hai."
26,Right. sounds as though you're not happy with that?,routine,207_26,T,irq,,Thik hai. Lagta hai ki tum usse khush nahi ho?
27,"Well, you know, I think that actually, the NHS are running out of money out there. And he's decided that I've had enough tests small and  you know, if you go on the internet, there's loads of tests that he could have sent me for.",routine,207_27,P,id,,"Arre, tu jaanta hai na, main sochta hoon ki sach mein, the NHS wale paise ki kami ho gayi hai. Aur usne decide kiya hai ki mujhe chote-chote tests se bhar kar diya hai aur tu jaanta hai, agar tu internet par jata hai, wahan pe bohot saare tests hai jo wo mujhe bhej sakta tha."
28,Right,inactive,207_28,T,ack,,Sahi hai
29,"If I had a bit more money, I'd go Private. I just don't think he's got to the bottom of it.",inactive,207_29,P,id,,"Agar mere paas thoda sa aur paise hote, main niji jata. Mujhe lagta hai ke usne iss baat ka gehraai tak nahi pohochi hai."
30,So you feel as though actually enough hasn't been done in the way.,inactive,207_30,T,crq,,Tumhe lagta hai ki ab tak bahut kam kia gaya hai.
31,"He's not.  There's loads more he could do, I'm sure. Right. Okay.",inactive,207_31,P,cd,,"Wo nahi hai. Woh bahut kuch aur bhi kar sakta hai, main sure hoon. Theek hai. Sahi."
32,"It sounds like you've had these problems now for about four years, you've you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach. You've tried a lot of tablets, some prescribed some herbal remedies, and you've had some investigations, but you're not entirely happy that you've been investigated thoroughly enough. Is that is that about it?",symp/reasoning,207_32,T,yq,,"Lagta hai ki tumhare paas lagbhag char saalon se yeh proble,t hain, tumhare pet mein kai tarah ke lakshan hain. Tumne bahut si tablets try ki hain, kuch prescribed aur kuch herbal remedies, aur tumne kuch jaanch ki hain, par tum poori tarah khush nahi ho ki tumhari jaanch puri tarah se ho chuki hai. Kya yeh tumhare baare mein hai?"
33,Yes,routine,207_33,P,ack,,Haan
34,"Right. Okay. And can I ask you, Barbara, how is all of this affecting you day to day, how's how's it affecting your life?",routine,207_34,T,irq,,"Sahi. Thik hai. Aur mein aapse poochh sakta hun, Barbara ji, yeh sab aapke din bhar mein kaise asar kar raha hai, aapki zindagi par kaisa asar ho raha hai?"
35,"Well, it's had quite, quite a big impact. I mean, the first thing the biggest thing, I suppose is that I, I went from being full time to part time at work. I just couldn't sit all day comfortably. And so in part time, In the end, I hope about a year ago I stopped work altogether, right. I missed that. I missed the girls we used to use least once a week night to the pictures or drink. That's one thing.",routine,207_35,P,id,,"Arrey, issne kayi kayi bada asar pada hai. Matlab, sabse bada cheez yeh hai ke main, main kaam se poora waqt se part time ho gayi. Main din bhar baith nahi sakti thi araam se. Toh part time ho gayi, Aur ek saal saath kaam karna chod diya. Haan, yaad aaya, maine woh kaam miss kia. Hum ladkiyon ke saath kam se kam ek baar hafteme shaam ko pictures dekhne ya drink karne jaate the. Yeh ek cheez hai."
36,That's something you quite enjoyed.,inactive,207_36,T,gc,,That's kuchh aap khub mazaa liye.
37,"Yes, yes. Yes, we just have a laugh. ",inactive,207_37,P,ack,,"Haan, Haan. Haan, hum sirf mazaak kar rahe hain."
38,Okay.,inactive,207_38,T,ack,,Thik hai
39,"I used to go to swing in shape. I used to go to an exercise class that was I missed the exercise Actually, that was once a week, but you know, the thing was, I wasn't comfortable. Never felt quite right doing all this exercise. I was always worried I was going to be taken shorter So I stopped that.",routine,207_39,P,id,,"Main to tyari chadhai me jaati thi, ek exercise class me tha jisme mujhe exercise achhi lagi par pata nahi kyun mujhse use ek baar miss ho gaya. Haan, bas ek baar hafta me hota tha, par pata nahi, mujhe sahi se na lagta tha ye sab exercise karte hue. Hamesha chinta hoti thi ki kabhi kam kaam hote toh phir kya hoga. Tabhi maine chhod di."
40,right,inactive,207_40,T,ack,,sahi
41,"Then well, my husband and I used to go out for meals. That's another thing we don't do anymore Now.That's Quite a few things really.",routine,207_41,P,gc,,"Fir toh, mere pati aur mai meals ke liye bahar jane ka shauk rakhte the. Yeh ek aur baat hai jo ab hum nahi karte hai. Ye bahut si baatein hai sachchai mein."
42,"Yeah, it does, It does sound as though over the last few years, your life has really changed quite a lot because of the symptoms. It's It sounds like you're doing very few of the things that you used to do. ",routine,207_42,T,gc,,"Haan, lagta hai ke pichle kuch saalon mein tumhari zindagi ke symptoms ki wajah se bahut hi badal gayi hai. Lagta hai jaise tum ab woh sab kaam bahut kam kar rahe ho jo tum pehle karte the."
43,"Hmm, right. ",inactive,207_43,P,ack,,"Hm, theek hai."
44,What is it you spend your average day doing now?,routine,207_44,T,irq,,Tum ab kya karte ho apne average din mein?
45,"Well, I put around the house. I spent perhaps a little bit too much time watching. I've got a bit hooked on daytime television, I have to say draw you in don't do. I read a bit the old magazines but generally I'm at home.",routine,207_45,P,id,,"ठीक है, मैं घर के आसपास रखा । मुझे संशोधित काला को जस्टहमनेनवां पद्रग्टरदूऺ पर काम करने के लिए थोड़ा अधिक समय चला। मैं दिनभर टेलीविजन पर उल्लसित हो गया था, मुझे स्पष्ट करना पड़ता है कि समाप्त अवधि"
46,"Right. Okay. Okay. And have you been any times of the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms for example, have there been any times when things have been better for you?",routine,207_46,T,irq,,"Haan. Thik hai. Thik hai. Aur kya aapne pichle chaar saalo me koi baar aisa dekha hai jaha aapke lakshan me koi badi tabdiliyaan hui hain? Jaise ki, kya aapko kabhi aisa waqt mehsoos hua hai jab aapke liye cheezein behtar ho gayi hain?"
47,"Last year My son got married. And I have to say I was worried that that I wouldn't be able to cope with it that I wouldn't be feeling well enough. But surprisingly enough, I was in good form. I think it was about three weeks in the summer getting ready for it and the whole heart of the wedding, but I was in good, really good form for that. Yeah. That was a good time.",routine,207_47,P,id,,"Pichle saal mere bete ne shaadi karli. Aur mujhe kehna hai ki main pareshan tha ki main us se nahi nibha paunga aur main theek tarah se mehsoos nahi kar paunga. Lekin behatar haalat mein tha meri. Mujhe lagta hai main teen hafte tak taiyaar hone mein laga aur shaadi ka saara main dil, lekin meri behatar haalat thi uske liye. Haan. Woh ek accha waqt tha."
48,Right. And how were you told me symptoms then?,symp/reasoning,207_48,T,irq,,Theek. Aur tume mujhe tabhi bataya tha mujhe lakshan kya the?
49,I hardly noticed them. Yes. It seemed to clear up,symp/reasoning,207_49,P,id,,Mai unhe gaur se nahi dekha. Haan. Lag raha tha ki sab theek ho raha hai.
50,nice,inactive,207_50,T,gc,,accha
51,"which was good,",inactive,207_51,P,irq,,"Joki accha tha,"
52,"right, That's interesting And are there any times when you Tummy symptoms bother you More seem particularly bad?",symp/reasoning,207_52,T,id,,"Right, Ye toh interesting hai, Kya kabhi tumhe stomach ki samasya aati hai, aur kuch samay jab tumhare tummy ke lakshan zyada zyada chatur hai?"
53,"Well, it's I'm having a bit of a bad patch at the moment. It's particularly uncomfortable. I have to say I do notice it when my husband's away. He, he travels with his job and he can be away a couple of times A month And that's not very often not good, then I have to say,",symp/reasoning,207_53,P,gc,,"Well, yeh toh I'm having a bit of a bad patch right now ho gaya hai. Yeh especially uncomfortable hai. I have to say ki mujhe yeh notice hota hai jab mere husband dur chale jaate hain. He, woh apne job ke liye travel karte hain and woh kuch baar mahine me dur rehte hain. Aur woh kaafi kam hota hai, toh mujhe yeh kehna padta hai,"
54,so you notice it's the worst when your husband's not around.,symp/reasoning,207_54,T,gc,,तो तुम नोटिस करते हो की जब तुम्हारा पति नहीं होता ह
55,Maybe I'm thinking about it a bit more. I don't know when he's not there.,symp/reasoning,207_55,P,gc,,Shayad main thoda zyada soch rahi hoon. Mujhe nahi pata jab woh nahi hota hai.
56,"Right. Now, you've been seeing Dr. Brown about this for the last few years. What is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong here?",routine,207_56,T,irq,,"tik hai. Ab, tum Dr. Brown se apne is baare mein keh rahe ho, peechle kuch saalon se. Woh kya baat karte hai jisse unhe lagta hai ki yahaan kuch gadbad hai?"
57,"Well, he he thinks it's all in my head. He's he says it's stress. ",routine,207_57,P,id,,"Arey, wo wo sochta hai ki yeh sab meri mann mein hai. Wo kehta hai ki yeh stress hai."
58,"Right Okay. Um, what do you think?",routine,207_58,T,orq,,"Thik hai, kya tum sochte ho?"
59,"Well, I mean, it can't all be in my head. I hit too much physical pain for it to be in my head. I mean, it's real. It's it's a real pain.",routine,207_59,P,od,,"Arey yaar, main toh keh raha tha, sab meri dimaag mein nahi ho sakta. Mujhe itna physical dard hua hai ki yeh mere dimaag mein nahi ho sakta. Matlab, yeh haqeeqat hai. Yeh ek asal dard hai."
60,And if you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it,routine,207_60,T,orq,,"और अगर आपको अपने मन में कोई विचार है कि यह क्या कारण हो सकता है, तो आप"
61,"Well, I mean, I did think that perhaps it was an infection that hadn't cleared up in the early stages. But I think I mean, sometimes I think it's IBS friend of mines got that and it sounds similar. And then other times, I think, I wonder if it's an ulcer on a really bad day, I start to think it might be  cancer",routine,207_61,P,od,,"Well, Mere Ko Lagay Ki shayad Ussme Se koi Infection hoga Jo Abhi tak Thik Nahi Hua hai. Lekin sometimes Sochta Hu Ki shayad Woh IBS hai Mere Kuch dosto Ko Bhi Yehi Problem hai aur Mujhe lagta Hai Ki Mujhe Bhi Waisa Hi Ho sakta Hai. Lekin Kabhi Kabhi Sochta hu Ki Shayad Yeh Ulcer Ho Ya fir Kuch Aur Lekin Jab bohot Kharab Din Hote hai, then Mujhe Yeh Cancer Bhi Lagta Hai."
62,right,inactive,207_62,T,ack,,thik
63,"My mother in law my mother in law died of cancer last year and she had a growth the doctor didn't investigate that by the time they found it, it was the size of a football and it was it was too late to operate them. So you know, when I go to bed at night now and I just feel and make sure there's nothing different going on And yeah, I worry about that.",symp/reasoning,207_63,P,gc,,"Meri saas ka cancer se inteqaal pichle saal hua aur unko ek ganth thi jo doctor ne jaanch nahi ki. Jab pata chala tab yeh football ki tarah badi ho chuki thi aur operation karne ke liye bahut late tha. Isliye ab raat ko sone se pehle main jaankari to leleti hu ki koi naya problem to nahi hai. Haan, mujhe is baat ki chinta hoti hai."
64,"So you're, you're kind of prodding having a feel at night just to see if you can feel anything.",symp/reasoning,207_64,T,gc,,"So tum, tum raat ko kuch mehsoos karne ke liye chhed karte ho, bus dekhne ke liye ki kuch mehsoos ho sakta hai."
65,Yeah. So just want to make sure there's nothing changing down there You know,symp/reasoning,207_65,P,gc,,"Haan. Bas yeh dhyaan rakhna chahte hain ki wahan koi badlaav na ho, samjhe."
66,"Right. Okay. Okay. So just to make sure that I've got the story straight you've, you've seen Dr. Brown for couple of years, you've tried a variety of medications, some prescribed some from the herbal shop, and none of them really made a great deal of difference. You've had some investigations, but you perhaps feel you've not had enough investigations. And times you worried that this could be something quite serious like a cancer. Is that if I got the story, right,",symp/reasoning,207_66,T,gc,,"Theek hai. Thik hai. Thik hai. Toh bas yeh aap ko suntakar mai yeh yakeen kar loon ke aap Dr. Brown se kuch saal se mile hai, aapne kai tarah ki dawaiyan try ki hai, kuch ko aapne doctor ki dava se lekin kuch ko ayurvedic dukaan se, lekin koi farak nahi pada. Aapne kuch jaanch karvayi hai, lekin shayad aapko lag raha hai ke aapne kaafi kam jaanch karvayi hai. Aur kabhi kabhi aapko dar hai ke shayad yeh koi gambheer bimari ho jaise ki cancer. Kya mai sahi story samjha raha hoon?"
67,yes,inactive,207_67,P,ack,,"Haan,"
68,"Barbara, what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today?",symp/reasoning,207_68,T,irq,,"""Barbara, aaj maine tere liye kya karne ki ummeed rakh rahi thi?"""
69,"Well, I thought, you know, you're a new doctor here and you've just finished your medical training. I wondered whether you know, with new eyes and new way of looking at at the problem. You probably know about different tests and new tests that my doctor doesn't know about, you know, new developments, that perhaps you could send me for some different tests.",symp/reasoning,207_69,P,id,,"Achha toh, main soch raha tha ke tum, pata hai, tum yahan naye doctor ho aur tumne abhi apna medical training pura kiya hai. Mujhe yeh soch ke pareshani hui ke ab tum, naye nazariye aur nayi tareeke se problem ko dekhne ka tarika jaante ho. Shayad tumhe mere doctor se alag alag tests ke baare mein pata hai aur naye tests ke baare mein bhi jo mere doctor ko pata nahi hai, pata hai, naye vikas ke baare mein jo shayad tum mujhe kuch alag tests ke liye bhej sakte ho."
70,Right. Right. So you're hoping that I'd send you four more tests?,routine,207_70,T,irq,,Theek hai. Theek hai. Toh tum yeh umeed kar rahe ho ki main tumhe chaar aur tests bhejunga?
71,"Hmm. Well, I think this, there's got to be something that tests might reveal. ",routine,207_71,P,id,,"Hm. Accha, mujhe lagta hai ki isme kuch aisa hona chahiye jo tests se pata chalega."
72,"Right. Okay. Well, I think Barbara having having heard his story and heard about the symptoms, I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you. And the reason for that is because you've you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years, and they've not shown anything. And you symptoms haven't really changed that much. So it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that they'd show anything different than what we already know. So it'd be I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests. ",symp/reasoning,207_72,T,od,,"Thik acha. Tik hai. Toh, main Barbara ka story sunkar aur uske symptoms ke baare mein sun kar yeh samajhti hu ki aapko iss point par aur test karwane ka koi faayda nahi hoga. Aur iska karan yeh hai ki aapne pichle do saalo mein bohot si zaruri jaanchen karwayi hai, par kuch bhi nahi dikha. Aur aapke symptoms mein bohot kam badlav aaye hai. Issliye bohot kam possibility hai ki agar hum ab aapko aur tests ke liye bhejen, toh kuch naya pata chale. Toh main aapko kehti hu ki aapke liye aur tests karwane se sirf waqt zaaya hoga."
73,"So it's like, do you think it's all in my head that you're going to be like Dr. Brown, you think I'm imagining all of this?",routine,207_73,P,crq,,"Yeh toh aisa hai, kya tumhe lagta hai ki meri dimaag mein hi hai ki tum Dr. Brown ki tarah ho jaaoge, kya mujhe lag raha hai ki main sab kuch imagine kar rahi hoon?"
74,"No, I think that you clearly have pain. And it clearly you have lots of physical symptoms and they clearly getting in the way of your life and causing you a lot of disability. I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body. Sometimes these things can go together. I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married, and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and when your husband's away, which is something you don't like very much. Sometimes somehow his symptoms then will seem greater. So I guess what I'm wondering, Barbara is if the might be some kind of a link with you between how you feel In your mind and what's going on in your life, and and how much you symptoms trouble you. Do you think that's a possibility?",symp/reasoning,207_74,T,on,,"Nahi, mujhe lagta hai ki aapko clearly dard hai. Aur ye baat saaf hai ki aapke paas bahut saare physical symptoms hai aur wo aapki zindagi mein problem ban rahe hai aur aapko bahut si takleef de rahe hai. Main ye sochta hu ki ye cheezein ya to zehn mein hai ya fir pure sharir mein hai. Kabhi kabhi ye dono sath mein ho sakte hai. Main aapke bare mein soch raha hu jab aapne bataya ki jab aapke beta ki shaadi hui thi, aap bahut busy the aur bahut khush the aur kuch na kuch tarha se aapki takleef kam lagti thi, aur jab aapke pati dur hote hai, jo aapko pasand nahi hai, tab kuch tarha se aapki takleef bhi zyada lagti hai. To main ye soch raha hu, Barbara, ki kya ye aapke zehn mein kaise mehsoos kar rahe hai aur aapki zindagi mein kya ho raha hai aur kitni takleef de rahe hai, kya ye dono mein koi connection ho sakta hai? Kya aapko lagta hai ki ye ek aisa possible hai?"
75,"Well, I can't see that my mind can be causing this amount of pain.",symp/reasoning,207_75,P,on,,Mujhe lagta hai ki meri dimaag is dard ki itni matra kaaran ban sakta hai.
76,"I'm not saying that the pains in your mind. I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel, and the way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms. Given that we've tried medication for you, and we've tried investigations, and we've drawn a blank really with those, none of those have really helped you. I guess I'm wondering whether now, it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems.",symp/reasoning,207_76,T,on,,"Main bol raha hoon ki tere dimag mein dard hai. Mera matlab hai ki kabhi-kabhi humare mehsoos karne ka tarika aur humari jeevan ki sthiti hamare lakshan ka dhyan kaise dete hai, is par asar padta hai. Ab jab humne tere liye dawaiyaan try ki hai aur jaanchen bhi ki, lekin kuchh fayda nahi hua. Shayad ab, tere samasyao ke liye kuchh naya tarika try karna accha hoga."
77,What sort of approach?,symp/reasoning,207_77,P,crq,,Kis tarah ka tarika?
78,"Well, I guess, thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life. I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years, your life's really changed. It seems to have been Really shrunk down. And it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of, is that right?",symp/reasoning,207_78,T,cd,,"Well, mujhe lagta hai ki, apne thode se aura of life ke baare mein soch rahe hain. Main un baaton ke baare mein soch raha hu ki aapki zindagi last four years mein kaafi badal gayi hai. Woh jaadu apne aap kam ho gaya hai. Aur lagta hai ki aap woh saari cheezein nahi kar rahe hain jo pahle karte the aur jisse aapko khushi milti thi, kya yeh sahi hai?"
79,"Well, I just can't do them. Yeah, I can't do them anymore.",inactive,207_79,P,id,,"Haan, main vo kar hi nahi sakta. Haan, main ab vo kar nahi sakta."
80,"And I guess I wonder it sounds as though you've you've dropped doing those things, because you felt you couldn't do them. But I wonder if in a funny way, what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now, has kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with the way that that your life is at the moment. And I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you?",symp/reasoning,207_80,T,irq,,"Aur main sochta hun ki shayad aapne woh kaam chhod diye hai kyunki aapko lagta hai ki aap unhe nahi kar sakte hai. Par main ye bhi sochta hun ki kya hua hai ki ab aap woh sukhad cheezein nahi kar rahe hai, iss tarah se aapke jeevan ke saath khushnaseeb nahi hai. Aur main yeh bhi sochta hun ki kya ye aapke liye aapke lakshanon ko bura kar sakta hai?"
81,"Oh, I don't know.",inactive,207_81,P,on,,"Oh, main nahi jaanta."
82,"I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day. And maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things. Even if it's just meeting up with your female friends once a week. And whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life. I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking. And the fact that you, you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth of sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you, which are doing nothing, and which may actually be making some of these symptoms Worse, I guess. What would you think about trying that slightly different approach for, say, two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference?",symp/reasoning,207_82,T,irq,,"Mere khayaal hai ki humein ab istemaal karna chahiye ki hum zindagi mein kya karte hain aur din bhar kya karte hain. Aur shayad kuchh aise sukhad cheezo ko waapas laane ki koshish karna. Chahe agar bas saal mein ek baar apne female doston se milna ho. Aur kya aise kaam karne se aapki zindagi ka mazaak mein shayad behtar ho sakta hai. Main aapki liye liye tablets ke baare mein bhi soch rahi hoon. Aur ye bhi ki aap bahut saari tablets lete hain aur soch rahi hoon ki kya unhe dekh kar baithna aur unhen samajhna aur asal mein tay kar lena ki kaunsi aapki madad kar rahi hai, kaunsi bilkul kaam nahi kar rahi hai, aur kaunsi aapki dikkat badha rahi hai. Aap is tarah se kaam karne ke baare mein kya sochenge, ke, kareeb do ya teen mahine ke liye, sirf dekhne ke liye ki kya ye kisi farq padhta hai ya nahi?"
83,"What two, three months is a long time if there is something going on, I mean, that's what happened to my mother in law, you know, they they left her and didn't spot it and",routine,207_83,P,id,,"Kya do teen mahine kaafi lambe samay hai agar kuch chal raha hai, yaani ki, mere saas ko bhi waise hi hua tha, pata hai, unhe unhe chhod diya aur dekha nahi gaya."
84,"well, I guess, if we if we did decide to work together like this, this new approach, I'd be seeing you regularly, we can keep an eye on your symptoms and if they change then we can investigate as appropriate proof They stay the same, then, you know, we could be pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that that we're missing. How would that sound?",routine,207_84,T,irq,,"Achha, mujhe lagta hai, agar humne aisa decide kiya ki hum aise saath mein kaam karenge, yeh naya tariqa, toh main aapko nihitar se dekh paunga, hum aapke lakshan par nazar rakh sakte hain, aur agar woh badal jaaye toh hum use theek kar sakte hain, agar woh same hi rehte hain toh aapko pata chalega ki kuchh naya ho raha hai, jo humse bhool gaya hai. Yeh kaisa lagega?"
85,"So, what are you saying then that I should come back and see you",routine,207_85,P,id,,"Toh, tu kya bol raha hai fir main wapas aa ke tujhe dekhun?"
86,"I think that would be a good idea. I think we've only just begun talk about it. And I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it, and then perhaps come back, perhaps if you booked him for a double slot next week. And that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach. And perhaps if you could also bring your your tablets in or make a list of them. We can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there. How would that sound Barbara?",routine,207_86,T,irq,,"I think that would be a good idea. Main sochte hain ki hum sirf abhi uske baare mein baat karne shuru kiye hain. Aur main sochta hoon ki shayad tumhe thoda samay chahiye is par vichar karne ke liye, phir shayad agle hafte double slot ke liye use book kar sakte ho. Aur woh hume iss naye approach ke baare mein sochne ke liye accha khunka samay dega. Aur shayad agar tum apne tablets lekar aao ya unki ek list bana do. Hum dekh sakte hain ki tum kya le rahe ho aur phir wahan se aage ja sakte hain. Kaisa lagega ye tujhe Barbara?"
87,"Okay, well, to make an appointment for next week, come back and see you again and talk about it a bit more.",routine,207_87,P,id,,"ठीक है, दूसरे हफ्ते के लिए एक अपॉइंटमेंट बनाने के लिए, फिर से आ जाइए और इसके बारे में थोड़ा औ"
88,"Yes, I think so. I think that would be a good, a good start.",inactive,207_88,T,od,,"Haan, main yeh sochti hoon ki yeh ek accha, ek accha shuruwaat hoga."
89,And I'll make a list of the tablets that I'm taking here and bring all the bottles down.,inactive,207_89,P,gc,,"Aur main yahan par le rahe hain aur saari bottle niche la raha hun, un sab tablets ki list banaunga jo main le raha hun."
90,Okay. All right. Okay. All right. So see you again next week,inactive,207_90,T,gt,,Theek hai. Theek hai. Theek hai. Theek hai. Toh next week fir se milenge.
