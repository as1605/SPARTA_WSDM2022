7,"Not really. I mean, it's just the same except one You know, like, I just I feel like what's the point? I don't feel like continuing on.",story,170_7,P,id,,"Not really. I mean, it's ilikewise except one surprise. You know, like, I just, like, what the goal of it? I don't feel like continuing on."
8,You don't feel like continuing with your life.,story,170_8,T,crq,,Tumhe zindagi ke saath aage badhne ka man nahi hai.
9,"Yeah, kind of",story,170_9,P,cd,,"Haan, thoda sa"
10,Have you been having thoughts of suicide?,story,170_10,T,yq,,Kya aapko suicide ke vichaar aa rahe hain?
11,"I mean, I think about what it would be like to just end things. I think it would be a lot easier. But at the same time, like, I can't imagine doing it. But you know, I can't say I haven't thought about it. ",story,170_11,P,id,,"""Mera matlab ye hain, main sirf end karne ka sochti hoon. Mujhe lagta hain ki ye kaafi aasan hoga. Par usi samay, main ye bhi sochti hoon ki main kaise kar sakti hoon. Lekin jaante ho, maine iske baare mein nahi socha hain bilkul nahi."""
12,"So you have some thoughts about it, what prevents you from doing it?",symp/reasoning,170_12,T,irq,,"Toh aapke paas kuch vichaar hain iske baare mein, phir bhi aapko isko karne se kya rok raha hai?"
13,"I don't know. I mean, I guess I know what it would be like for my family. I don't want to hurt them.",symp/reasoning,170_13,P,id,,"Mujhe nahi pata hai. Mera matlab hai, main sochta hoon ki meri parivaar ke liye aisa kaisa hoga. Mujhe unhe dard dena nahi hai."
14,They would be hurt?,symp/reasoning,170_14,T,crq,,Kya voh hurt honge?
15,"Yes and it's scary, I mean, the thought of dying is scary, but the thought of going on is painful.",symp/reasoning,170_15,P,cd,,"Haan aur yeh darawna hai, main manta hoon, marne ka khayal darawna hai, lekin jeena ka khayal dardnaak hai."
16,So it almost sounds as if by squaring it down a bit.,symp/reasoning,170_16,T,id,,To aajkal yeh lagta hai jaise ki usse thoda chota karke badein toh aisa lagta hai.
17,"Yeah, I kind of feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Like I just don't know where to go from here.",,170_17,P,id,,"Haan, mujhe aisa lagta hai ki mein ek sthaan aur ek mushkil jagah ke beech fas gaya hoon. Mujhe aisa lagta hai ki mein yahaan se kahan jaaoon iska pata hi nahi hai."
18,Have you worked out in a specific plan or so?,symp/reasoning,170_18,T,yq,,Kya tumne ek specific plan mein exercise ki hai ya kuch aur?
19,"No, I mean, you know, you know, I thought like if I were to do it, you know, ways but not not specific because I just don't think that I could do it, you know, like, I don't. I thought about suicide, but I don't like, seriously consider it as an option. But it's starting to like creep into my thoughts. And it never has before so that I'm like, kind of concerned about that. Like, I guess I know. Sometimes people like really planted and but for me, I've it's an I've never really considered it before so it's really scaryfor me. ",symp/reasoning,170_19,P,id,,"Nah, I meant, you know, you know, I thought like agar main karoonga, you know, koi tareeka par nahi nahi nahi kyunki mere khayaal mein koshish nahi kar sakta, you know, like, main sochta tha. Main khudkhushi ke baare mein socha, but main seriously consider nahi kiya jaisa ek option. Lekin yeh meri khayaal mein dabe start hua hai. Aur pehle kabhi hua hi nahi isliye main slightly concerned hun. Jaise log bohot sochte hain par mere liye, maine kabhi nahi socha isliye yeh bohot scary hai mere liye."
20,"So, this how long been going on this feelings?",story,170_20,T,irq,,"Toh, yeh kab se chal raha hai yeh ehsaas?"
21,"Um, I think like in the past couple of days, it started you know, more so and then like today, it was just like the first thought in my head and I couldn't stop thinking about it and that's why I wanted to see you because I'm just feeling I'm starting to feel like a little bit out of control.",story,170_21,P,id,,"मैं सोचता हूं कि पिछले कुछ दिनों से, यह शुरू हुआ था और आपको पता है, ज्यादातर ऐसा होता था और फिर आज, मेरे सिर में पहला ख्याल था और मैं उसके बारे में रोक नहीं पा रहा था और इसलिए मैं आपसे मिलना चाहता था क्योंकि मैं अपने आप को थोड़ा सा हाथ से निकलने का महसूस कर रहा हूँ।"
22,"Okay, so and today and maybe the past few days been kind of new feeling that a new thought you don't want to continue life continue living. But at the same time, you don't want to commit suicide. You don't have a plan.",story,170_22,T,id,,"Theek hai, toh aaj aur sayad pichle kuch dinon se ek naye ehsaas kiya hai ki aapki zindagi mein koi naya khayal aya hai jisse aap agey nahi badhna chahte. Par usi samay, aap khudkushi karne ka bhi mann nahi karte. Aapke paas koi scheme nahi hai."
23,"Yeah, I don't want to I, I really don't want to but, you know, like I said, I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place like it. It's not, I know it's not a good option. I just like Sometimes I feel like I'm so stuck. I just don't know where else to go.",story,170_23,P,ack,,"Haan, mujhe karne ki ichha nahi hai, main sach me nahi karna chahta lekin, tum jaante ho na, main ek mushkil pad gaya hoon. Ye, mujhe pata hai ki ye ek accha vikalp nahi hai. Bus, sometimes mujhe esa lagta hai ki mai bahut hi phans gaya hoon. Mujhe nahi pata ki aur kaha jaau."
24,"So if, we'll call it feeling depression, right, because that's what we've talked about before, is the depression will go away? Do you think that would change your outlook on?",symp/reasoning,170_24,T,yq,,"To agar hum ise depression mehsoos karenge, sahi na, kyunki yahi hai jo hum pehle baat kiye the, kya depression door ho jaega? Kya aapko lagta hai ki yeh aapki najariye ko badal dega?"
25,"Definitely, I think that is like the reason why I, the reason why the thought of not living anymore comes into my head is because of my depression because I just feel so like, my emotions are out of control, because I wake up feeling so down and so useless and pointless, that it makes me wish that I was dead. But if I didn't have that feeling, then I wouldn't wish that I was dead. Because I know that my life has value and I know that my family would want me around and I know there's a future for me, but my feelings make me feel like my future is just dark and pointless",symp/reasoning,170_25,P,id,,"पक्का, मैं विश्वास करता हूं कि वह वजह है कि मैं, उसी कारण से मेरे दिमाग में जीना नहीं चाहते होने की सोच आती है। मुझे यह लगता है कि यह मेरे डिप्रेशन की वजह से है क्योंकि मुझे बस ऐसा लगता है कि मेरे भावनाएं नियंत्रण से बाहर हैं, क्योंकि मैं उतना ही गिरा-गिरा होता हूं। सुबह जब मैं उठता हूं तो मुझे बहुत उदास और बेकार लगता है, जो मुझे मौत की तरह बना देता है। पर यदि मेरे पास वह भावना न होती तो मैं मौत को इच्छा नहीं करता। क्योंकि मुझे पता है कि मेरे जीवन का मूल्य है और मुझे पता है कि मेरे परिवार को मेरी जरूरत है और मुझे पता है कि मेरे लिए एक भव"
26,"Alright these suicidal ideations I know you're, you're telling me you haven't had them before, so I can appreciate that they're scary. They could be scary, even if you hadn't had them before, are fairly common with depression. And you've, it sounds like what you're really saying is you're frustrated, and you're tired of being sick. And I think that you make a valid point when you say your family would be upset if you happen to regularly talk about your family before and it would seem to be very upset. When I see your life has value. I want to try to hang on to that thought. After we're done here today, tell me what you have planned for us today.",symp/reasoning,170_26,T,id,,"Thik hai, yeh suicidal vichaar hain, mujhe pata hai tu, pehle kabhi nahi aaye the, toh main samajh sakta hun ki yeh darawne ho sakte hain. Darawne ho sakte hain, chahe pehle kabhi na aaye hon, depression ke saath yeh kaafi common hote hain. Aur lagta hai ki jo tu kehna chahte hain woh sach hai, tu thak gaya hai aur tere ko bimaar hone se pareshaani ho rahi hai. Aur jab tu kehti hai ki tere pariwaar pareshaan hoga agar tu apne pariwaar ke baare mein hamesha baat karta hai, toh unhe bhi bura lagega. Jab main tere jeene ki ehmiyat dekhta hun. Main tere usi vichaar ko achha karne ki koshish karta hun. Jab hamara ye baat khatam ho jaega, toh mujhe batana ki aaj hum kya karenge."
27,"Well, I didn't I didn't really have plans because I kind of you know, came here feeling like I really needed to see you so I kind of put things on hold but I mean, I guess I would go home and, and, you know, I'm not really sure. ",symp/reasoning,170_27,P,id,,"Well, mere ko to koi masti-maji ka plan hi nahi tha kyunki mujhe aisa laga ki tujhe dekhne ki bahut zaroorat hai isliye maine kuch aur cheezein ruk di. Lekin, main ghar jaakar, pata nahi kya karunga, samajh nahi aa raha hai."
28,Anywhere else you will go?,symp/reasoning,170_28,T,yq,,Aap kahin aur jayenge?
29,"No. But, I mean, I probably could go to my parents house if I needed to, I could probably call them in and see, you know, it's getting close to the afternoon so they get off work soon.",symp/reasoning,170_29,P,on,,"Nahi. Lekin maine ki, mai shayad apne maa baap ke ghar ja sakta hoon agar zarurat pade toh, mai unhe andar bula sakta hoon aur dekh sakta hoon, jaise hi dopahar ke paas aata hai toh unki naukri bhi khatam ho jaati hai."
30,Can you do that for me? Can you go there?,symp/reasoning,170_30,T,yq,,Kya tum mere liye woh kar sakte ho? Kya tum wahaan ja sakte ho?
31,"Yeah, I think that's a good idea.",symp/reasoning,170_31,P,op,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ke woh ek achhi sooch hai."
32,"And we'll kind of play by here from that point. I'm going to see you today. We'll we'll do some work today. Well, I'll see you again tomorrow. All right. So if you could spend a night there that that would be a wiser choice, given your thoughts and your feelings right now. Have you ever haven't used the term contract for safety?",symp/reasoning,170_32,T,irq,,"Aur hum yahaan se khelte rahenge. Main aaj tumhe dekhunga. Hum aaj kuch kaam karenge. Toh, main kal phir tumhe dekhunga. Thik hai. Toh agar tum wahaan raat bita sakte ho toh woh tumhare abhi ke vichaaron aur bhawnaon ke liye wahiyaat nirnay hoga. Kya tum kabhi suraksha ke liye the contract padhe nahi ho?"
33,I think you mentioned it before. I'm not really sure.,symp/reasoning,170_33,P,id,,मुझे लगता है तुमने पहले ही इसे उल्लेख किया था
34,"Okay. So what it means is you kind of an only if it's authentic, I want this to be true is kind of where you promised me that you're going to be safe until I see you again, right for the foreseeable future that you don't have any intent or plan to harm yourself. Can you make that promise to me now? ",routine,170_34,T,yq,,"Okay. Toh yeh matlab hai ki agar yeh sach hota hai, tab hi main chahta hoon yeh sach ho ki jab tak main tumhe dobara nahi dekhta tab tak tum surakshit raho, sahi jahan tak ki tumhare paas khud ko nuksaan pahuchane ka koi irada ya yojana nahi hai. Kya tum mujhe abhi yeh vaada de sakte ho?"
35,Yeah,routine,170_35,P,op,,Haan
36,Okay. All right. So give me a minute and I'll come back and overcome a bit today. And now I'm going to schedule you see tomorrow as well.,routine,170_36,T,id,,Thik hai. Theek hai. Toh mujhe ek minute de do aur main vapas aa jaunga aur aaj thoda tumhare saath chaturayi karoonga. Aur ab main kal bhi tumhe dekhne ka samay schedule kar raha hoon.
37,yeah.,inactive,170_37,P,op,,haan.
38,okay,inactive,170_38,T,ack,,Theek hai
39,Thank you.,inactive,170_39,P,gt,,Dhanyavaad.
