0,"Hi Miss Clark, My name is Alan Lime. I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center. Dr. Steele asked me if I would spend some time with you today. I'm really glad that you're here. I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me.",routine,204_0,T,gt,,"Namaste Miss Clark, Mera naam Alan Lime hai. Main ek samajik karmachari hoon Family Health Center mein. Dr. Steele ne mujhse poocha ki aaj main aapke saath thoda waqt bita sakta hoon. Mujhe bahut khushi hai ki aap yahaan hai. Main bas ye jaanna chahta hoon ki unhone aapko mujhe kyun bheja."
1,"Well, I came to see Dr. Seal last week because of increasing stress and anxiety, that's kind of getting the best of me. And in the course of my appointment with him, he was asking how I was dealing with that stress. And I mentioned that my one or two glasses of wine a few nights a week is turning into more frequent and maybe three or four on some nights and he had some concerns about that and, and felt like maybe you could help me with stress or something.",symp/reasoning,204_1,P,gt,,"Maine Dr. Seal ko pichle hafte dekha kyonki mujhe badhne wale tanav aur ghabraahat ki wajah se pareshani ho rahi thi, woh mere saath Appointment mein pooch rahe the ki main us tanav se kaise deal kar rahi hoon. Maine kaha ki haal hi mein meri ek ya do raat ko thodi si daru peene ki aadat hai, par abhi yeh aur aksar ho gaya hai, kai raaton mein teen ya chaar glass upar neeche ho jaate hain aur Dr. Seal ko is bare mein kuch chinta ho rahi thi, isliye woh iss tanav se chutkara paane ke liye meri madad kar sakte hain."
2,"Yeah. So he, he actually see me because you went to him for increased stress. And he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase And prior to prescribing anything, you want to make sure that you at least had someone to talk to that",symp/reasoning,204_2,T,gc,,"Haan. Toh woh, woh mujhe dekh raha hai kyunki tumne usse badhe huye tanav ke liye poochh liya. Aur woh pareshan hai ki tumhari sharab ki matra uske badhne ka ek hissa ho sakta hai Aur kuch bhi nirdeshit karne se pehle, tumhe ek vyakti ke saath baat karne ka kam se kam mauka diya jaana chahiye ki"
3,I suppose.,inactive,204_3,P,gc,,Mujhe lagta hai.
4,Okay. So you filled in one of the Pink Sheets and I take a look at that.,routine,204_4,T,crq,,Achha. Toh tumne ek Pink Sheet bhar diya aur main usko dekhti hoon.
5,He told me to fill that out and bring it with me.,routine,204_5,P,cd,,Wo mujhse bola ki usse bharkar mere saath laaye.
6,"Okay, thank you. So, you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week, you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well. And that you have one or two drinks in one setting ",symp/reasoning,204_6,T,irq,,"Okay,dhanyavaad. So, tum ek haftemein chaar ya ussese bhi zyaada drinks peete ho, tumne kaha ki tum ho sakta hai usmein thoda sa badhaav kar rahe ho. Aur tum ek setting mein ek ya do drinks peete ho."
7,"typically, yeah. ",inactive,204_7,P,id,,ab usually hi hota hai.
8,And maybe monthly you have more than that. What what's what kind of drinks do you have? What do you do when you typically drink,symp/reasoning,204_8,T,irq,,And shayad har mahine aapko usse zyada hai. Kya kya tarah ke peene ki cheezein hain aapke paas? Jab aap aam taur par peete hain toh kya karte hain?
9,"wine with my meals? You know, again, one or two, typically and more frequently, three or four. My stress is increased.",symp/reasoning,204_9,P,id,,"मेरे भोजन के साथ वाइन? तुम तो जानते हो, फिर से, एक या दो, आमतौर पर और अधिकतर, तीन या चार। मेरा"
10,"So it's time to increase your strength a little more. Well, based on what you put here, you get it gives you six points on this scale scale ranging from zero to 46 points will put you in what we would consider an at risk zone. So if it's okay with you to talk a little bit about that,",symp/reasoning,204_10,T,id,,"Toh ab hamein thoda aur taqat badhane ka waqt aa gaya hai. Aapne yahaan kya likha hai us par base karke, aapko is scale ke zero se 46 points ke beech chhere points milenge, jo ki hum anhene khatarnaak zone kehte hain. Toh agar aapko theek lagta hai, hum iske baare mein thoda baat kar sakte hain."
11,okay,inactive,204_11,P,ack,,thik hai
12,"okay. So that was sunset run zero to 40. It's not a sort of super high risk, but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress might be some physical ailments related to alcohol as well could could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there, or even stay there. This is a typical standard drink size over here, I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine or not,",symp/reasoning,204_12,T,irq,,"ठीक है। तो वह सूर्यास्त की दौड़ जेरो से चालीस तक थी। यह कोई उच्च जोखिम वाला नहीं है, लेकिन यह शायद तनाव में वृद्धि या शराब से संबंधित कुछ शारीरिक बीमारियों के लिए खतरा हो सकता है, यदि आप अपनी पीने की राशि बढ़ाते हैं या वहीं रहते हैं। यह यहां एक सामान्य मात्रा का पीने का आकार है, मुझे यह पता नहीं कि यह आपके बेली की एक ग्लास से मेल खाता है या नहीं।"
13,I feel the glass up so maybe a little more than that,routine,204_13,P,id,,"Mujhe glass bhar rakha hai, shayad thoda aur jyada."
14,"maybe the little space it's upset, perhaps a drink drink and a half each one. So that also increased a little bit more. So perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here. And for women, healthy woman your age, no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be low or no risk and one seven in one week, seven total in total a week and what you say here is that even on this sheet, you're perhaps already drinking more than that. So what do you make of all that?",symp/reasoning,204_14,T,irq,,"Shayad thoda sa space upset ho gya h, shayad thoda sa aur peene ka mann kar rha h, aur peena half ek ek karke. Fir bhi, itna zyada peena bhi badh gya h. Shayad shots se jyada peene lage h aur yeh sheet par indicate kia h. For women, iss sheet par indicate kia h ki agar aapki age hai healthy woman ki, tab bhi aapko ek setting mein jyada se jyada teen shots pee skti h jo ki low ya no risk hoti h, aur poore week mein saat shots pee skti h. Aur jaisa ki iss sheet par indicate kia gya h, shayad abhi se hi aap zyada pee rahe h. Toh iska matlab kya hai aapke liye sab?"
15,"That news to me, you know, I thought red wine with your meals is supposed to be healthy. You know, no more than seven in a week? That seems kind of prohibitive?",routine,204_15,P,id,,"""Yaar, ussey sunke mujhe shock lag gaya, main socha tha ki apne khane ke saath lal sharaab peena swasth hota hai. Pata hai, ek hafta mein saath se zyada nahi hona chahiye? Lagta hai thoda sa rok thama hai na?"""
16,"Yeah, it seems seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking or what you consider to be healthy drinking. And certainly there's there's conflicting information out there about what's healthy and what's not healthy. Imagine the increased stress work because we're concerned doctor seal as your stress increases, and if you were to describe you anything, maybe some interaction between the two, that would also be a concern for him. I would, I would think, so if you would, what is it that you like about alcohol?",symp/reasoning,204_16,T,irq,,"Haan, lagta hai ki thoda kam ho gaya hai shayad aapne pi liya hai ya woh aapke liye sahi maante hai. Aur beshak, wahan par kuch uljhan hai kya sahi hai aur kya nahin sahi hai. Sochiye ki kaam karne mein badhta hua dabaav kyunki hum doctor se chintit hote hain, aur agar aap baat karte hain, toh shayad kuch doosre ke beech ka interaction bhi uske liye chinta ka vishay ho sakta hai. Main nahin, main toh sochta hoon ki agar aapko kuch pasand hai toh woh kya hai sharaab mein?"
17,"Well, you know, it does, at least in the moment, temporarily reduce my stress. And I you know, like a good glass of wine. I don't don't drink the cheap stuff. I like the expensive.",symp/reasoning,204_17,P,id,,"Well, you know, it does, at least in the moment, temporarily reduce my stress. Aur main jaanta hoon, ek accha glass wine ki tarah. Main sastaa nahi peeta. Main mehenga pasand karta hoon."
18,"See, like the taste of it. And it does help to lower the stress, even if it's just for the fun of me drinking. What's not so good things about alcohol for you.",routine,204_18,T,crq,,"Look, mujhe iska swaad pasand hai. Aur isse stress kam karne mein madad bhi milti hai, chahe meri tafri mein hi kyun na ho. Tumhare liye sharab mein kya buri baatein hain?"
19,"Um, well, you know, the nights that maybe I have a couple more glasses than I should I wake up feeling kinda yaak and, of course, part of my stress is finances. And I mentioned I like the good stuff. And so if I'm drinking more than I'm increasing my financial burden,",symp/reasoning,204_19,P,on,,"""Ek dum, toh, pata hai na, vo raatein jab main shayad zyada glasses le leta hoon tab main uth kar thoda yaak feel karta hoon aur, beshak, meri stress ka ek hissa hai finances. Aur maine mention kiya tha ki mujhe acha pasand hai. Toh agar main zyada peeta hoon toh apne financial burden ko bhi zyada karta hoon."""
20,your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking.,routine,204_20,T,cd,,"Tumhare paise ki chinta maybe badh sakti hai, kyunki tum pee rahe ho."
21,"Yeah, kind of defeating the purpose they're",routine,204_21,P,gc,,"Haan, thoda purpose ko defeat karne ki hi to koshish kar rahe hai wo."
22," the drink introduce stress and increasing stress at the same time. So on the one hand, it low is it on the other hand, it's increasing kind of the seesaw teeter totter effect. What do you make of that, given that on one hand, it lowers on the other hand, it increases and and now it's increasing even more?",symp/reasoning,204_22,T,irq,,"Is drink mein matlaab stress ko introduce kar ke aur uski taqat badhaane mein dono taraf ek saath kaam karta hai. Isi tarah ek taraf low hai aur doosre taraf badhaata hai, jaise ki teeter totter ka prabhav. Aap iske baare mein kya sochte hain, jabki ek haath pe kam karta hai aur doosre haath pe zyada badha raha hai aur ab aur zyada badh raha hai?"
23,And maybe I need to find some other way to deal with my stress. Yeah.,routine,204_23,P,id,,Aur lagta hai mujhe apne tanav se niwaran karne ke liye koi aur tarika dhundna padega. Haan.
24,Imagine investment thoughts so that what have you thought of trying?,routine,204_24,T,irq,,Imagine nivesh vichar so that tu kya koshish karne ki soch raha hai?
25,"Well, I've exercised in the past and that helps. Right now. My schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do. That's why I came to see Dr. seal. I thought maybe he can prescribe me something that would help. You know, when I'm feeling overwhelmed,",symp/reasoning,204_25,P,id,,"Achha, maine pehle bhi exercise kiya hai aur woh madad karta hai. Abhi toh. Mera schedule thoda phir se bigda hua hai aur main bilkul nahi jaanta kya karun. Isliye main Dr. Seal ke paas aaya hoon. Main socha shayad woh mujhe kuch dawai likh sake jo madad kar sake. Pata hai, jab mujhe stress hoti hai,"
26,"And he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink, the level that you are drinking, that whatever he prescribes you, there may be an interaction with it to mention that he's concerned. I'm not completely sure. So you've had some success in the past of changing behaviors. And if you were to decide to make any changes here that sounds like you could draw upon that to make those changes. How important would it be for you on a scale of zero to 10? I have a low visual hero that if zero is not important, ten is very important to do something about your drinking wine.",symp/reasoning,204_26,T,irq,,"Aur voh ho sakta hai ki main kah raha hoon ki voh kar nahi sakte, main bas imagine kar raha hoon ki unhe chinta hai ki agar aap peena jaari rakhe, jitna aap peete hain, us level se, jo bhi voh aapko prescribe karte hain, uske saath kuch interaction ho sakta hai, voh mention karen ki unhe chinta hai, main puri tarah se sure nahi hoon. To aapne pehle bhi kuch badlav karne mein kaamyaabi haasil ki hai. Aur agar aap yahaan koi bhi badlaav karne ka faisla len, toh lagta hai aap un badlavon ka istemaal kar sakte hain. Aapke liye yeh kitna mahatvapurna hoga ek zero se lekar joy tak scale par? Mere liye ek darshak soch hai ki agar zero bahut mahatvapurna nahi hai, toh joy bahut sangatvapurna hai kuch bhi course drink karne ke baare mein kuch karne ke baare mein."
27,"Well, I mean, if if it means that it's increasing my stress and or he's not going to prescribe me anything because of my drinking, then it's fairly important, maybe about seven. ",symp/reasoning,204_27,P,id,,"Arrey yaar, I mean, agar yeh mere stress badha raha hai aur ya toh woh mujhe kuch bhi nahi likhega kyunki main sharab peeta hoon, toh iss baat ka behad mahatva hai, lagbhag saat."
28,It's it's pretty up there. What do you choose a seven out of five or four?,routine,204_28,T,orq,,"Yeh pretty up hai. Tum kya chunoge, paanch se aath ya chaar?"
29,"Well, again, I got to get things under control. You know, My kids are dependent on me and I've got to go to work to help ease this financial stress. And so, you know, all those responsibilities",routine,204_29,P,od,,"Arey yaar, phir se, mujhe sab kuchh control mein laana padega. Tum jaante ho na, mere bache mujh par nirbhar hain aur main kaam par jaana hoga is financial stress ko kam karne ke liye. Aur isi liye, tum jaante ho, sab woh zimmedariyan."
30,there's a lot riding on your decision on what to do with this. What if anything would bring up to an eight or nine on that scale?,routine,204_30,T,orq,,There is bahut saara riding on aapki decision on kya karna hai uske saath. Kya koi cheez lekar aapke paas le aayegi aath ya nau par us scale pe?
31,"Well, the you know, the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction, I certainly can't afford to, you know, have any more stress.  So, yeah, ",routine,204_31,P,od,,"Well, you know, the risk that you mentioned about the drug interaction, I certainly can't afford to have any more stress. So, haan,"
32,so so you you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it. And if lowering your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do.,symp/reasoning,204_32,T,yq,,"So so, tere ko apni chinta kam karne ki bajay badhaana chunna hai. Aur agar tere peene ko kam karne se woh fayda hoga, toh main tujhe willing hoon karne ke liye."
33,hmmm,routine,204_33,P,ack,,अर
34,How confident are you that you could do something about your drinking?,symp/reasoning,204_34,T,irq,,"Tum kya keh rahe ho ki aap apne peene ki aadat ko kuch kar sakte ho, is par kitna vishwaas hai?"
35,"I'm pretty confident and you know, probably about a seven or an eight ",symp/reasoning,204_35,P,id,,"""I'm pretty confident and you know, ye lagbhag saat ya aath ke bare mein hai"""
36,"Okay, so it's pretty high up there again, and what if, what if anything, would you choose to do would it be to cut down would it be to quit? I'm just curious about that",routine,204_36,T,irq,,"Achha, toh woh dobara wahaan pe kaafi upar hain, aur agar kuch bhi ho, toh tum kya choose karoge, kya tum kam karna chahoge ya phir quit karna chahoge? Main sirf uske baare mein curious hoon."
37,"I you know, I like a lot A glass of wine, I don't want to quit altogether, I'd be willing to try cutting that. But now if it's going to, if Dr. Seal would agree to prescribe me something for the anxiety, and it meant that I had to not drink at all, I'd be willing to do that at least for a period of time.",routine,204_37,P,id,,"Yaar, I do really enjoy A glass of wine, but I don't want to totally stop. If Dr. Seal allows me to take medicine for anxiety and if it means I have to stop drinking completely, I am ready to do it for a while."
38,"So you'd be willing to stop altogether. That's what was indicated by the physician. Okay. So based on that, how ready are you to do anything right now, whether it's to cut back whether it's to quit?",symp/reasoning,204_38,T,crq,,"Toh kya tum bilkul bandh karne ke liye tayyar ho? Yahi hauslaanaki wajha batayi gayi thi dwaara. Thik hai toh uspar kya bharosa hai? Abhi aap kisi bhi cheez ko karna kitna tayyar ho, chahe wo dheere karne ke liye ho ya poori tarah se chhodne ke liye?"
39,"Well, again, you know, if if I can get something to help me manage if maybe I can find some other way to deal with the stress, then then you know, I be pretty ready. Again, maybe about an on that scale, maybe an eight.",routine,204_39,P,cd,,"Arey, firse, tu jaanta hai na, agar mujhe kuch mil jaaye jo mujhe madad kar sake agar shayad mujhe stress se deal karne ka koi aur tarika mil jaaye, toh tu jaanta hai na, main bilkul tayyar hounga. Firse, shayad yeh bhi ek baat hai ki, shayad yeh scale pe kareeb aath ke beech ho jaye."
40,"Okay, so that's, that's pretty hot there as well. It sounds as though you're pretty motivated to do something about this right now, given any responsibilities given your children learning at this point. And just on lowering anxiety, in general, it sounds and that's one of your goals as well. Well, I'm pretty confident Once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do, you'll be able to follow through with it. Based on your experience in the past of making behavior changes. I mentioned some things that you can draw upon. What's one thing that you could do? Imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress.",routine,204_40,T,irq,,"Aree, toh that's hot hi hot lagra hain. It seems you're highly motivated to kuch bhi karne ke liye abhi, considering your responsibilities aur tumhare bachchon ke is stage pe learning. Aur specially, anxiety ko kam karne ke liye, tumhare goal bhi yehi hain. Well, I'm quite confident ki jab tum decide karo kuch bhi karne ke liye, tum follow-through karne ke liye capable hoge. Based on tumhari past experience of making behavior changes, maine kuch cheezein mention ki hain jo tum use kar sakte ho. Tum kya kar sakte ho? Imagine tumne kuch cheezein sochi hongi jo tumhari stress ko kam karne mein madad kar sakti hai."
41,"Oh, I you know that the exercise but again, that's that's kind of difficult to fit in right now. I'm hoping that Dr. Seal will prescribe something for me to take when I'm feeling particularly overwhelmed and maybe just having somebody to talk to to bounce some things off of ",symp/reasoning,204_41,P,id,,"Arre, main samajhti hoon ki tumhe pata hai wo exercise lekin phir se, woh thoda mushkil hai abhi adjust karne ke liye. Main ummeed karti hoon ki Dr. Seal mujhe kuch dawa likhega jab main bahut zyada overwhelmed feel kar rahi hoon aur shayad bas kisi se baat kar ke kuch cheezein discuss karne ka mauka mile."
42,"one of the things we can offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this this area of your life, this area of increased stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make an appointment for you for like before you leave today to talk to somebody",symp/reasoning,204_42,T,id,,"Hamari yahan se ek cheez hamingish mein pesh kar sakte hain, yeh hai ki aap aaiye aur apne behavioral health experts se baat kijiye, aur wo aapko iss zindagi ke kshetra mein, yani jisme aapko zyada dabav aur zimmedari lagti hai, iss baare mein madad kar payenge. Aap aaj hi jaa kar kisi se baat karne ke liye humse appointment bana sakte hain."
43,That would be nice,inactive,204_43,P,ack,,वह अच्छा होगा
44,"that also has some information here if you're interested, some pamphlet on alcohol and and how what helps limits on how it may be affected by medications that you take as well. And I wish you lots of luck. It sounds as though you're really committed to making this shift in this change. And I imagine doctors still want to follow up with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks.",routine,204_44,T,id,,"Yeh bhi kuch jaankari hai agar aapko dilchaspi hai, kuch alcohol ke baare mein aur ye bhi ki kis tarah dawaon se alag hokar uss par prabhav padta hai. Aur main aapko bahut saare shubhkamnayein deti hun. Lagta hai aap is badlav ko laane mein sachet ho. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki aapke doctors aapse aur aapke kuch hafte baad badlav ke bare mein jaankari lena chahte honge."
45,Okay,inactive,204_45,P,ack,,Theek hai
46,"Again, I look forward to speaking to you in the future.",inactive,204_46,T,gt,,"Phir se, main aap se baat karne ka anumaan rakhta hoon aane wale samay mein."
47,"All right, thank you very much.",inactive,204_47,P,gt,,"Tikke, bahut dhanyawad."
