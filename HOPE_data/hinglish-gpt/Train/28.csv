20,"All right, is there any other areas where it might disrupt functioning?",routine,28_20,T,irq,,"Theek hai, kya koi aur jagah hai jahan yeh karya pranali ko vighatit kar sakta hai?"
21,"Sometimes it's hard to get up and get to work the next morning After I've had, if I drink it like later in the day, it's hard to get up and get to work on time the next morning.

Isliye kuch baar mai late ho gaya hoon."
22,"So, three, three bottles of beer, pretty much every day,",routine,28_22,T,irq,,"Toh, teen, teen bottles beer, har roz thoda bahut,"
23,"pretty much every day,",routine,28_23,P,id,,"Har roz hi kafi zyada hogaya,"

28,Yeah. Was that you mentioned beer. Have you ever consumed any other type of alcohol,routine,28_28,T,irq,,Haan. Kya tumne beer ke baare mein kaha tha? Kya tumne kabhi koi aur tarah ki sharaab pi hai?

32,When did you first start using marijuana?,symp/reasoning,28_32,T,irq,,Tumne marijuana ka ishthasanskar kab kiya tha?

34,about two years ago.,routine,28_34,T,yq,,दो वर्षों पहले के ब

36,"On the weekends, sometimes other times",routine,28_36,T,yq,,"Sometimes, on the weekends aur kabhi-kabhi aur samay"
37,Yeah.,inactive,28_37,P,ack,,Haan.
38,"mostly on the weekends, occasionally during the week. Has it ever led to any trouble or change the function? ",routine,28_38,T,irq,,"Zyada mostly weekends par, kabhi kabhi hafto ke darmiyan hota hai. Kya isse kabhi koi mushkil ya koi badlav hua hai?"
39,"I am not, I mean, on the weekends, no, because I don't really have anywhere to be. But sometimes during the week if I, if I again, kind of like the alcohol if I smoke it too late again, it's hard to get up in the morning and get to work on time and my boss is really starting to get irritated with me how often I've been late. Not that I'm like, super late, but I'm late enough.",story,28_39,P,id,,"Main weekends, nahi, kyunki mere pas kahin jaane ko nahi hota hai aur kabhi kabhi hafto mei agar mai, yeh daaru jaise agar mai bahut der tak puff karo tab subah uthna mushkil ho jaata hai aur time per kaam karna aur mere boss ko bhi gussa aata hai kyunki mai kitne baar late ho jaata hu.

40,Have you ever tried to cut down on the substance use?,routine,28_40,T,irq,,Kya aap kabhi substance use kam karne ki koshish ki hai?
41,"Um, I've tried to cut back on the alcohol before. That a year ago I try. I was, like, started when I started this job that I have now. I tried to cut back when I first started. And I was able to get down to like two, one or two beers instead of three. But then the job got stressful and I got comfortable, I guess and started drinking more again.",story,28_41,P,id,,"Ek baar maine peene ki matra kam karne ki koshish ki thi. Vo ek saal pehle ki koshish thi. Jab maine apna naukri shuru kiya tha, tab main ne shuru kiya tha. Main pehle se hi kam peena chahata tha. Aur main teen ki jagah do, ya ek beer tak pahunche tha. Lekin phir naukri tension mein aa gayi aur main shuru mein comfortable ho gaya aur phir se zyada peene laga."
42,So you think perhaps the alcohol use is connected to the stress with your job?,routine,28_42,T,orq,,Kya tumhe lagta hai ki shayad alcohol ka istemaal tumhare job se hone wale tanav se juda hai?
43,"I yeah, I would say it's definitely connected.",routine,28_43,P,od,,Maine yahi kahunga ki yah zaroor jude huye hai.
44,Have you ever been annoyed by people that perhaps criticize your substance use?,routine,28_44,T,irq,,Kya aapko kabhi logon se krodhit huye hain jo shayad aapke substance ka istemal tareef karte hain?

Was my mom because it upsets her so much sometimes, like I'll feel guilty about how my son has to be upsets her but and sometimes I feel bad like if I have a fight with my friends if I'm not calm I'll feel bad the next day about getting into an argument with them cuz usually over something silly",story,28_49,P,id,,"Sahi. Mujhe khed hai. Kya meri maa kyunki itna pareshan ho jata hai, kabhi kabhi main apne bete ko khed hoga kiya par woh bhi hai aur kabhi kabhi mujhe bura lagta hai ki agar mere dost se ladai hogi toh main shaant nahi raha toh agli din bura lagta hai ki main unke saath jhagda kiya kyunki usually kuchh moorkh baaton ke liye hi hota hai."
50,Have you ever had to drink or use drugs first thing in the morning to study your nerves or to lessen the effects of the hangover?,routine,28_50,T,irq,,क्या आपने कभी सुबह दूसरी चीज उपयोग करके या नशीली दवाओं का सेवन करके अपने नसों को शांत करने या हैंगओवर के दुष्प्रभावों को कम करने क

52,"So on occasion that happens. Yeah,",routine,28_52,T,irq,,"So pichhe bhi kabhi kabhi ho jata hai. Haan,"
53,I wouldn't say it's often but on occasion.,routine,28_53,P,id,,Main kehna nai hunda ki eh sehmi sehmi si ghatna utte hi hunda hai par kai vari.
54,"So, Alcohol, Marijuana, two substances you currently use. Can you tell me about substances used in the past?",routine,28_54,T,irq,,"So, Alcohol aur Marijuana, yeh do cheezein jo aap thikaane aajkal istemaal karte hain. Kya aap mujhe bata sakte hain ki aapne pichle mein kis tarah ki cheezein istemaal ki hain?"
55,I'm at a party one time I tried ecstasy but I didn't like it. I ended up not really hanging out with those people anymore. So it wasn't an issue,routine,28_55,P,id,,"Main party mein ek baar maine ecstasy try kiya par mujhe pasand nahi aya. Uske baad, main un logo ke saath jyada nahi mila. Issliye yeh koi badi baat nahi thi."
56,"just the one time. Yeah, just the one time.",routine,28_56,T,ack,,"Ab bas ek baar. Haan, bas ek baar."
57,"I'm in high school, my friends. A lot of my friends were smokers. So I smoke cigarettes, but it kinda it just made me feel sick. And I never really liked very much didn't really do anything for me.",story,28_57,P,id,,"मैं हाई स्कूल में हूँ, मेरे दोस्त। मेरे कई दोस्त धूम्रपान करते थे। तो मैं सिगरेट पीता हूँ, पर वह मुझे सिर्फ उबकाई ही कराता था। और मुझे वास्तव में वो बिलकुल पसंद नहीं था, मेरे लिए कुछ भी नहीं करता था।"
58,So that didn't last she just continued.,inactive,28_58,T,yq,,"Isliye voh tik nahin rahi, vah bas jaari rahi."
59,Yeah. All right.,inactive,28_59,P,ack,,Haan. Thik hai.
60,Any other substances or just those two?,routine,28_60,T,irq,,Kya koi aur padarthy ya bas un dono?

65,"No, not that I'm aware of at least",routine,28_65,P,id,,"अरे नहीं, मुझे इसकी जानकारी तो नहीं है"
66,"before I moved to the next Section of the intake. While we're still talking about substance use, is there anything else you want to add in the comments you want to make about the section? ",inactive,28_66,T,irq,,"Before I moved to the next Section of the intake, abhi substance use k bare mein baat ho rhi hai, kya aap comments mein aur kuch add karna chahte hain ya section k bare mein koi aur baat karni hai?"
