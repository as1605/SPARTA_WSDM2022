I feel like I have to do it all myself.",symp/reasoning,112_19,P,ack,,"Haan. Haan.

23,"my partner, John's Bay like, he tries, but I think he is getting frustrated with me, too. He's sensing that. I guess he had expectations of how I would be and how we would be and how this would be and I think that he's disappointed in me.

Par main bas, yeh ho hi nahi raha hai. Hum dono ne bhi socha tha par main sach mein chahti thi, par mushkil hai kyonki main chahti thi."
28,"so at this point, and it's six weeks, they've been a really rough. Six weeks feels to me like really rough. Having waited so long to have this child gone through the birth and understand from a GPM pump was a somewhat difficult birth if it wasn't from I thought it was.

But a struggle that you're feeling very much alone with",routine,112_28,T,id,,"Itna time ho gaya hai, 6 hafto ke baad, unhe bahut mushkil ka samna karna pada hai.

Lekin aap akele mehsoos kar rahe hain."
