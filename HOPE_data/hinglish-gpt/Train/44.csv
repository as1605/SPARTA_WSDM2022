0,"Yes, you really get where they're coming from you really understand the suffering bowl.",symp/reasoning,44_0,T,id,0.0,"Haan, tum bilkul samajh sakte ho ki woh kahan se aa rahe hain, tum sach mein dukh ka ghaat samajhte ho."
1,"Yeah, I guess maybe that's part of where it's so hard for me is like, I know that I'm causing a lot of suffering for people.",symp/reasoning,44_1,P,id,-1.0,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki shayad yeh meri liye bohat mushkil hai, kyunki mujhe pata hai ki main logon ke liye bohat dum bana raha hoon."
2,"Well, let's, let's talk about that. So you're in, you're in a position where you have to make some decisions about people's lives. And sometimes those decisions result in people being separated from the family. Sometimes they don't. Are you really the cause? In the larger picture? Are you really the cause of these families being broken up?",story,44_2,T,irq,0.0,"Acha, chalo, chalo baat karte hai uske bare mein. Toh tum ek aese sthiti mein ho jahaan tumhe logo ke jeevan se judi kuch nirnay lene hote hai. Aur kabhi kabhi woh nirnay logon ko apne parivaar se alag kar dete hai. Kabhi kabhi nahi. Kya tum sach mein zimmedar ho? Badi tasveer mein? Kya tum sach mein iss parivaaro ko alag karne ka karan ho?"
3,"I guess not like it's their actions, if they were doing the right things, even if I did come in their kids wouldn't be removed. But it is still hard to be the one that pulls that trigger, you know.",story,44_3,P,on,-1.0,"Mujhe lagta hai ki unki kriya se nahin hai, agar wo sahi kaam kar rahe hote, toh main bhi unke paas aane par unke bachchon ko hata nahi deta. Lekin phir bhi uss goli ko chalane walon mein se ek hona mushkil hai, tum jaante ho na."
4,"Well, you're the immediate cause kind of at the end of the whole process, but the true cause happened years or months before you got there as people made decisions that maybe weren't the best for their children for themselves. So you're really coming in, to some extent the tail end of a long series of behavioral choices",story,44_4,T,id,0.0,"ठीक है, आप एक तरह से पूरे प्रक्रिया के अंत में तुरंत कारण हैं, लेकिन असली कारण आप पहुँचने से सालों या महीनों पहले हो गया था, जिसमें लोगों ने फैसले लिए जो शायद उनके बच्चों या खुद के लिए सबसे अच्छे नहीं थे। तो आप सच में एक लंबे स्त्रोत के पायने में आ रहे हैं, एक बार के बाद के व्यवहारिक चुनावों की।"
5,Yeah. That's true.,routine,44_5,P,op,0.0,Haan. Yahi sahi hai.
6,"Ultimately, for this family that's causing you the cycle that you're worried about. In kind of the looking at the long term lengths, do you think the children are better off? Because they're not with a family right now?",story,44_6,T,irq,0.0,"Kya aakhirkar is parivar ke liye jo aapko pareshaan kar raha hai, is se aapko chintit hone ki vajah hai. Lambi kareke mein dekhne par, kya aapko lagta hai ki bachche abhi dusre parivar ke saath hone se behtar hai? Kyunki ve abhi parivar ke saath nahi hain?"
7,"I mean, if they get with a good family, which, you know, usually they do. It's, it's good for them, you know, maybe it could be a wake up call for the parents, or if not, at least the kids are getting their needs met and stuff like that. It's probably really hard for the kids and they probably want to go back to their parents. But I think overall, we wouldn't be doing this if we didn't think that it would be best for the kids to go to a place where they're going to be taken care of.",story,44_7,P,id,1.0,"Mujhe matlab hai, agar unhe ek achhi family se mil jaye, jaise ki aam taur par hota hai. Yeh, yeh unke liye achha hota hai, pata hai, shayad yeh unke liye ek jagriti call ho sakta hai, ya fir, agar nahi toh kam se kam bachchon ki zarooriyaton ko pura karne ke liye bachchon ko unke mool zarooriyaton ki farmanburkh hota hai. Bachchon ke liye yeh shayad bahut mushkil hoga, woh shayad apne parents ke paas jana chahte honge. Lekin main yehi sochta hun ki hum yeh nahi kar rahe hai agar hum chahte hi nahi ki bachchon ke liye yeh sabse achha hai ki woh apni zarooriyaton ke liye unke khayal rakhne wale jagah par jayein."
8,"So immediately, there's some pain because you have to pick up the family but the long run. Maybe there's a better result. Even with that, though, let's talk about the concern you have about making a poor decision. So this based on what you're describing, do you believe this was actually a poor decision?",story,44_8,T,id,0.0,"Toh turant hi, thodi si takaleef hai kyunki tumhe parivaar ko uthana padega lekin isse kaafi door tak kaam chalega. Shayad behtar parinaam ho. Par uske bawajood, chalo, tumhare mann mein yeh chinta hai ki tum ek behtar faisla naa le paaye. Toh yeh is baat par aadhaarit hai jo tum bata rahe ho, kya tumhe lagta hai ki yeh sach mein ek bura faisla tha?"
9,I guess not. It just feels like it is.,routine,44_9,P,on,0.0,Main toh yahi samjha tha. Mujhe bas lag raha hai ki aisa hai.
10,"Yeah, it feels like it is. And it was a tough decision. But looking at it in the weight of the evidence. Maybe you can appreciate that you might have had to the same thing you if you go back in time.",routine,44_10,T,id,0.0,"Yeah, mujhe lagta hai ki yehi baat hai. Aur yeh ek mushkil faisla tha. Lekin usse saboot ki roshni mein dekhte hue, shayad aap samajh sakte hain ki aapko bhi agar waqt par palatne ki zaroorat padi ho toh aap bhi yehi karte."
11,"Yeah. Yeah, I think so. And I'm not sure anybody else would have made a different decision either.",routine,44_11,P,op,1.0,"Haan. Haan, mujhe lagta hai. Aur main kisi aur ne bhi alag taur par faisla nahin kiya hoga."
12,So you really did what you had to do. Because there's still a pain component there for them. You're feeling torn. And you don't want to go through this again?,symp/reasoning,44_12,T,id,0.0,"""So basically, you did what you had to do. Kyunki unke liye waha ab bhi dard ka tukda hai. You are feeling torn between what you should and shouldn't do. Aur aap nahi chahte ki aap phir se isse guzre?"""
13,"No, I mean, not this feeling. But I do want to keep doing my job.",routine,44_13,P,on,0.0,"Nahi, main toh yeh abhaas nahi keh rahi. Par mujhe apni naukri jari rakhne ki ichha hai."
14,"But doing your job in a world where you could make a mistake, that's not as appealing.",routine,44_14,T,crq,0.0,"Lekin agar tum apna kaam karoge ek duniya mein jahan tum galti kar sakte ho, toh yeh utna hi akarshak nahi hai."
15,"Yeah, I mean, I guess I always knew I could make mistakes, but it just feels really real now, I guess that is the difference.",symp/reasoning,44_15,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan, mujhe mtlb h, main to hamesha se jaanta tha ki main galtiyaan kr skta hu, pr ab vo really real mehsus hota h, shayad yhi farak h."
16,"So in this particular instance, this what you're saying doesn't seem like a mistake. Let's consider a situation where you did make a mistake. That would be the worst case, right? We're just taking things to the worst case scenario. Okay. Your fear here is that in a sense, regardless of what already happened, going forward, you'd be mortified to make an error. Because this pain you're feeling right now. There's just a variable that's thrown everything into chaos for you. So looking around like where you work and and the history of your profession, what's the mistake you see people make from time to time and you'll be frightened of.",story,44_16,T,id,0.0,"Is situation me, jo ap keh rahe hain vo koi galti lag nahi rahi hai. Chalo socho ek situation jisme apne galti ki ho. To vo sabse bura case hoga, sahi? Hum sirf worst case ke bare me soch rahe hain. Thik hai. Apki is dar ki wajah se hai ke, koi bhi pehle ho chuka ho, aage jaake bhi agar ap galti karte hain to apko bahut sharminda hona padega. Kyunki jo dukh ab apko ho raha hai, vo bas ek variable hai jo sab kuch hila deta hai apke liye. To ap apne kaam ke aas paas dekhte hain, apni profession ki history dekhte hain, kya aapko koi galti dikhti hai jo log kabhi kabhi karte hain aur ap usse darte hain?"
17,I guess the biggest mistake you can really make is to miss some form of abuse or something like that.,symp/reasoning,44_17,P,id,0.0,मुझे लगता है कि सबसे बड़ी गलती जो आप कर सकते हैं वो है कि कोई तरह की गाली या कुछ शांति की वस्तु छूट
18,And then someone's hurt. Okay.,symp/reasoning,44_18,T,id,0.0,Aur phir kisi ko chot lagi hai. Theek hai.
19,summary,"The patient feels they are causing suffering for a lot of people. The patient acknowledges that it is best for the kids to be removed but hard to be the one to pull the trigger. The patient feels that initially it is a hard decision for the family and kids to be separated but in the long run, it is a better result. The patient feels torn, a pain component and does not want to go through this feeling. The patient wants to keep doing the job and acknowledges they may make mistake in their job. In worst case, the biggest mistake the patient feels they can make is miss some form of abuse and someone's hurt. ",,,,,
