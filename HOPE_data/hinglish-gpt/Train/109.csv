And when we got there, I was actually the room. And when I got the gist of it, I told my parents how me being mixed race ways to learn or by having two different parents at the time could be a bad thing for me, because I went to a predominantly African American but he's obese something so like, you know, apples and oranges don't mix. You know, Black Black Black History Month came around. And you know, you had a chance to pick some who wants to be a pick Harriet Tubman. No, and I was like, Oh, you're not black enough to be her and they had pictures on the wall. And look at her. She's black. You know what, when you put black paint on your face, and you don't always like to be a slave and things like that. So it became up.

Jab main ghar aaya, toh bina doubt, meri maa ko bhi pata lagana tha, woh parent teacher conference mein gaye thhe. Aur jab hum wahin pahunche, toh main actually wahan ki vishayikta mein tha.

Black History Month aa gaya aur aapko kaabil ko chunne ka ek mauka mila, main Harriet Tubman ko chunna chahta tha. Par, nahi, mujhe bola gaya ki tum Black Black nahi ho, toh woh wall par pictures dikhayi gayi thhi. Aur dekho unko, woh black hain. Aap samjho, jab apne chehre par kaala rang lagaate ho, toh hamesha ghulam nahi bannna chahte. Aise hi cheezein chehre par aayi. Main hurt nahi tha aur mujhe samajh nahi aaya."

8,"I don't think it was. I just didn't understand what a pity party No, but at times, but it just sort of get to yours because there's age where the kids get sort of meaner about the teasing and aren't really even High School thinking. High School, the same thing came up, just put in a Cinco de Mayo. And of African American students are probably one of the Latino students had a problem with it's when I'm caught in the middle.",story,109_8,P,id,,"Main naheen socha tha ki yah aisa thaa. Main bas samajh nahin paaya ki yeh kanjoosi party thi. Nahin, par kabhi kabhi aisa hota hai, par yeh sirf aap tak pahunchna hai kyonki bachche jyada chhidakna shuru kar dete hain aur High School mein bhi sochte nahin hain. High School mein, ek hi baat aayi hai, yeh sirf Cinco de Mayo ho jaaye. Aur African American students shayad hi Latino students se pareshaan the, jab main beech mein phansa tha."
9,"Yeah. I do you think she's emotionally guarded. Um, I think she'll speak to that later in the session. You know, so it says I think there have been injuries. Some of which I'm going to guess really are related to the the race pieces that she's experienced where she has felt judged under scrutiny and it just keeps repeating herself and it's separate from competitors. Man accomplishments and so there is a guardedness and there is a sensitivity and the guardedness is her way of protecting some of her vulnerability. Okay, let's move on to",story,109_9,T,id,,"Haan. M janta hun, voh emotionally guarded hai. Uh, M sochta hun ki voh baad mein session mein iske baare mein baat karegi. Tum jaante ho, voh kehti hai ki kuch chot lag gayi hai. Kuch aisi chot jinmein voh apne race ke taur par rahi hui hai jahaan use judge kiya gaya aur uske upar scrutiny kara gaya hai aur voh khud ko alag kar rahi hai competitors se. Insan ki kamyabiyan aur uski karname isse judi nahi hai. Voh apni guardedness ke through apne vulnerability ko protect karti hai. Theek hai, aage badhte hain."
