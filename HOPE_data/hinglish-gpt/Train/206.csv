41,No.,inactive,206_41,P,on,,Nahi.
42,"And what we want to do, what I want to do to help you with this verse is one want to develop a treatment plan to help you with the marijuana use. We want to be able to look at your support system, you know who's in your life right now? What are your friends that you smoke marijuana with? What type of people are they? Would this be a good fit for you? But our whole goal is to start you off with small steps. `So today, you're using marijuana how many times a day. So you pretty much said you use it every day. 
",routine,206_42,T,yq,,"Aur hum karna chahte hai, jo main aapki is vaakya mein madad karne ke liye karna chahta hu, ek aise treatment plan banane ka, jo aapki marijuana istemaal mein help kar sake. Hum aapki support system pe nazar daalna chahte hai, aapke life mein kaun hai abhi? Aapke friends jo aapke saath marijuana peete hai, wo kis type ke log hai? Kya ye aapke liye sahi hai? Lekin humara pura goal hai ki hum aapko chote chote kadam se shuruwat karwaye. Toh aaj, aap marijuana ko kitni baar istemaal karte hai ek din mein.

43,Yeah.,inactive,206_43,P,ack,,Accha.
44,But how many times?,routine,206_44,T,irq,,Lekin kitni baar?
45,3-4 times,symp/reasoning,206_45,P,id,,Tin-chaar baar.
46,when do you wake up and what you do?,routine,206_46,T,irq,,Tum kab uthate ho aur kya karte ho?

They'll do Again, right",story,206_47,P,id,,"Haan. It's nahi meri morning routine hai. Go aage kar aur kar lo. Fir usually ke around noon time mein main dobara karlungi aur 5 baje ke aaspass fir se karungi. Raat ke time par main Fargo mein dobara karungi. Woh log phir se karenge, sahi na?"
48,so one of maybe one of the realistic goals is you're okay you know we can we can narrow down maybe the relationship see which of your friends right now today? How many of them smoke,routine,206_48,T,irq,,"So ek maybe ek of the realistic chunautiyon mein se ek hai ki aap theek hain, aap jaante hain hum ab aapke doston mein se kaun si aaj smoking kartey hain?"
49,about six seven,symp/reasoning,206_49,P,id,,chhe saat
50,Yeah so maybe a realistic short term goal is to begin to see which friends to hang out with you know and then also your mom man either way she,routine,206_50,T,gc,,"Haan toh shayad ek realist halka lambe samay takka lakshya hoga ki tere dost kaunse bhaagikkari hai, pata chal jaaye, aur uske saath milna shuru kare aur apni mummy bhi toh ek hi hai, chahae jaisa bhi ho."
51,"She told me before you fall into the wrong crowd and fall into something just she pretty much said that this if I keep this up is gonna get me into something I don't want to get into right now jail time round because we makes you do things that you shouldn't be doing for other things legal, right so,",symp/reasoning,206_51,P,gc,,"Usne mujhe bataya hai ki agar tum galat doston mein gir jao aur kuch aisa kar lo to woh mujhe kuch kehna chahti thi ki agar main aisa hi chal raha hu to mujhe kuch mein nahi hona chahiye abhi, jail mein rehni pad sakti hai kyunki humein cheezein karne padti hai jinhe humein karne nahi chahiye, sahi to hai na,"
52,"so definitely we want to look at your whole peer relationships who your friends are We also want to look at your your time right now. So, you mentioned earlier that you were working. Are you working today? ",routine,206_52,T,yq,,"Toh ham definitely aapke saare dosti rishton ko dekhna chahte hain. Ham bhi aapke vartamaan samay par nazar rakhna chahte hain. Toh, aapne pehle hi zikr kiya tha ki aap kaam kar rahe hain. Kya aap aaj bhi kaam kar rahe hain?"
53,No.,inactive,206_53,P,on,,No.
54,"Okay, so maybe that's another thing a realistic goal that we need to look at, and maybe help you pursue is it as a job? Maybe because the idle time sometimes can trigger events, you know, where you begin to want to use marijuana, and then we can identify some of the emotions that you're feeling. Let's go over that maybe briefly. Before you get before you smoke marijuana, is there a feeling that you have that says, hey, you depress, so we can look at the depression and see how we can treat that. What else? What are some of the other feelings that you see?",routine,206_54,T,irq,,"Acha, shayad yeh ek aur cheez hai jo hamay dekhna chahiye ki kya ek sachiv lakshya hai, aur shayad ham tumhari maddad kar sakte hai ki tum apna kaam chunoge? Shayad kyun ki free ka waqt kabhi kabhi ghatnaao ko trigger kar sakta hai, tum maloom hai, jahaan tum marijuana istemaal karna shuru karna chaho, aur phir ham tumhare mahusus hone waale kuchh bhaavon ko pehchaan sakte hai. Chalo uspe jaaein briefly. Tum marijuana pina se pahle, kya stithi hoti hai ya tumhe lagta hai ki tum udaas ho, to ham depression ko dekh sakte hai aur dekhein ki ham kaise uska ilaaj kar sakte hai. Aur kya? Kya kuchh aur bhaav dikhte hai tumhe?"
55,"so angry, You know",symp/reasoning,206_55,P,id,,"Kya gussa ho gaya, tu toh jaante ho."
56,what you think?,routine,206_56,T,orq,,Tum kya sochte ho?
