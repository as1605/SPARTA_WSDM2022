1,yes.,inactive,10_1,P,gt,,haan.
2,"Hi, I'm PJ Daniels. Sorry, let me wash my hands.",inactive,10_2,T,gc,,"Hello, main PJ Daniels hoon. Maafi, mujhe apni haath dhonay de do."
3,"Call me, Dorothy.",inactive,10_3,P,gc,,"Mujhe phone karo, Dorothy."
4,"Oh, thank you. That's the next thing I was going to ask you. So Dorothy, the nurse mentioned to me that you wanted to talk about your care is but what's going on?",symp/reasoning,10_4,T,irq,,"Arey, thank you. Aage ki baat karni thi. Toh Dorothy, nurse ne mujhe bataaya ki tum apni dekhbhaal ke baare mein baat karna chahti thi, par kya ho raha hai?"
5,"Five days ago, I was admitted to emergency. And they treated me by putting this tube down my throat. And I tried to, to tell them and gesture at them that I don't want this tube down my throat. And I just hope that never happens again.",symp/reasoning,10_5,P,id,,"Mere paanch din pehle, mujhe emergency ward mein admit kiya gaya. Aur mujhe is tube ko apne gala ke andar daal kar theek kiya gaya. Aur maine unhe bataane ki koshish ki aur unpar ishara kiya ki mujhe is tube ko apne gala ke andar nahi chahte. Aur mujhe bas yahi ummeed hai ki yeh kabhi phir se na ho."
6,"Okay. No, I totally understand that. I mean, that is quite a scary thing to go through. And I think we do need to talk about this more, and I'm glad that you've asked it. Talk to me about this. So I had a little bit of a look through your charts. I think I understand why they did it. But did anybody explain it to you?",routine,10_6,T,crq,,"Theek hain. Nahi, mujhe puri tarah se samajh hai ki. Mujhe yeh bilkul darrane wali baat lagti hai. Aur main sochta hun ki humein iske baare mein aur baat karni chahiye, aur main khushi se kahunga ki tumne puchha hai. Mujhe iske baare mein batayein. To maine tumhare charts thodi bahut dekhe hain. Main samajhta hun ki unhone yeh kyun kiya hai. Par kya kisine tumhe iske baare mein samjhaya?"
7,"Well, not really. And because I was gasping for air and in the state I was, but I'll tell you what, I'm really worried that this won't happen to me again. I don't want that to be anymore. I'm, I'm okay to to pass this. ",routine,10_7,P,cd,,"Nahi, bilkul nahi. Aur kyunki main hawa ke liye saans lene mein lipti thi aur us haalat mein thi, lekin main tumhe bata doon ki, main sach mein pareshan hoon ki yeh fir se mere saath na hoga. Mujhe yeh aur nahi chahiye. Main theek hoon, main isse par karne ke liye tyaar hoon."
8,"Absolutely. And you know what? There's no right answer when it comes to deciding on things that are aggressive, like the two, we really want to know what the patient values in terms of, you know, things that are that invasive, and so absolutely will respect whatever it is that you want. But I do need to find out a little bit more about you in terms of what is your understanding of what brought you into hospital.",routine,10_8,T,irq,,"Bilkul. Aur tum jaante ho kya? Jab baat aati hai aggressive cheezon par faisla karna to koi sahi jawaab nahi hota, jaise dono mein se, humein sach mein maloom karna hai ki patient ko kya important lagta hai, aise invasive cheezon ki, to bilkul hamaari taraf se wohi karenge jo tum chaho. Lekin mujhe thoda sa aur tumhaare baare mein jaanna zaruri hai, jaise tum hospital mein kyun aaye ho."
9,"Well, I have congested Part failure. And I guess there was water in my lungs and stopping me from breathing properly. So I was living in my soul, the ambulance brought me in to the emergency. So they that was how they were treating me.",symp/reasoning,10_9,P,id,,"अच्छा, मुझे अवरोधित भाग संबंधित समस्या हुई। और मुझे लगता है कि मेरे फेफड़ों में पानी भर गया था और सही से सांस ले लेने से रोक रहा था। तो मैं अपनी आत्मा में रह रहा था, एम्बुलेंस ने मुझे आपातकालीन में ले आया। तो वे मुझे कैसे"
10,So you pretty much showed up to emergency. And very quickly they put that tube down.,symp/reasoning,10_10,T,crq,,Toh tum emergency mein pahuch gaye ho. Aur bahut jaldi woh tube neeche daal diya gaya.
11,That's correct.,inactive,10_11,P,cd,,ठीक है।
12,Did anybody ask you if you were okay with that?,routine,10_12,T,crq,,Kisi ne pucha ki kya tum usse thik ho?
13,"Well, I tried to gesture to them that I don't want the tube but",routine,10_13,P,cd,,"Haan, maine unhe ishara karke bataya ki mujhe tube nahi chahiye."
14,they didn't quite pick up on that.,inactive,10_14,T,crq,,Unko ne vo puri tarah se nahi samajh liya.
15,"I guess not. And, you know, I've had that three times already. I don't want to go through with",symp/reasoning,10_15,P,cd,,"Shaayad karan toh nahi. Aur, pata hai, mujhe ussey teen baar ho chuka hai. Main nahi chahta ki main usey anjaana."
16,the two you've had.,inactive,10_16,T,crq,,दोनों तुम्हारे पास
17,Yes. I don't want it anymore.,inactive,10_17,P,cd,,"Haan, main ise ab nahi chahta."
18,"Okay. And so so you have congestive heart failure, and it sounds like you've got a breathing problem. Yes. And do you know why they would have put the tube down. Do you know what they were trying to do?",inactive,10_18,T,orq,,"Okay. Aur tumhare paas congestive heart failure hai, aur lagta hai ki tumhe sans lene mein problem hai. Haan. Aur kya tumhey pata hai ki unhone tube kyun daala tha. Kya tumhey pata hai woh kya koshish kar rahe they?"
19,"I guess because I was short of air. I had a hard time breathing, right? So they tried to, like, I'm going to use the word save me.",symp/reasoning,10_19,P,od,,"Mai soch raha tha kyunki mere paas saans ki kami thi. Mujhe saans lene mein bohot mushkil ho rahi thi, sahi toh? Toh wo koshish kar rahe the, jaise ki wo mujhe bachane ki koshish kar rahe the."
20,"Right. So it sounds like you understand that. I mean, usually we only put a tube in. If that was the only thing we could do to save you. Most of the time of congestive heart failure. We'll give some medications. Have you heard of lasix? Or furosemide? No, okay. It's a medication will often give if someone is in heart failure, but if someone is really sick, and then we don't think we have time to give it that's the time we would think of a breathing tube. haven't had a chance to look through the chart, but it would suggest to me you were pretty close to dying when you came in.",story,10_20,T,orq,,"Right. So it sounds like you samajhna ki baat kar rahe ho. I mean, aksar hum sirf tube hi daal dete hain. Agar aapko bachane ke liye, wohi humein karna padega. Maxar waqt me congestive heart failure ki bimaari hotee hai. Hum daayenge kuch dawaein. Kya aapne lasix ya furosemide ke baare mein suna hai? Nahi? Theek hai. Ye dawa am aksar hamare paas dil ki bimaari ka ilaaj ke liye dete hai, lekin agar kisi ko bahut bimar ho aur humein lagta hai ki time nahi hai toh hum breathing tube ka istemaal karte hain. Mai abhi aapke chart ko nahi dekh paayi, lekin ishara yeh karta hai ki aapki haalat behad nazdeek thi jab aap aae the."
21,"I I guess so. But I'm okay with dying. Okay. You know, like I says, I've lived a good life and if it If the good Lord says that it's my time, I'm okay with that. And you wouldn't put it to",story,10_21,P,od,,"I think so yaar. But mujhe marna bhi thik hai. Thik hai. Pata hai, jaise maine bola, maine achchi zindagi ji li hai aur agar bhagwan chahe to meri saari umar ka dhanyavaad karungi, mujhe thik hai. Aur tum usko nahi karoge na."
22,"No, my know already what I'm hearing from you. Exactly. I'm just gonna say exactly what you've said, sounds like you've lived a good life. You've been through this a few times, you know exactly what it involves. And if I could paraphrase to you quality of life is more important than quantity at this stage. Is that correct?",story,10_22,T,crq,,"आरे नहीं, मुझे पहले से ही पता है कि आप मुझसे क्या सुन रहे हो। सही। मैं बस वही बोलूंगा जो आपने कहा है, लगता है कि आपने अपने जीवन के अच्छे दिनों को बिताया है। आपने कुछ बार यह भी अनुभव किया है, आप ठीक से जानते हैं कि इसमें क्या शामिल है। और अगर मैं आपको परामर्शित करूँ कि जीवन की गुणवत्ता मुख्य है और"
23,"That is correct. And, but you know, what, doctor? How can I be assured that my wishes are respected, so I don't get this tube down?",routine,10_23,P,cd,,"Yeh sahi hai. Par, lekin tum jaante ho, kya aapko pata hai, doctor? Kaise main ye jaan saku ki meri ichhayein maanyi jayengi, taaki mujhe ye tube na dalna pade?"
24,"That's an excellent question. So first, I did want to answer your previous question, based on what we're talking about. Absolutely. I agree with you that it is your wish, and we will respect that wish that we're not going to put a breathing tube down again. And then of course, your second question, which is great, as well as how do we make sure this doesn't happen? So what I'm going to do after our conversation, and I do have a few more questions, To ask you but after conversation, I write a note documenting what we talked about that we talked about the breathing too. And your reasons for why you don't want it, which of course makes sense to me. And then what I do is I document a short form called goals of care. And I just so it's a really easy way for everyone to look at the form and in two seconds, I know exactly what you want, we will give you a copy of that to take home. But I find that's not usually enough. What we also do, what I do is I tend to when you leave hospital, dictate a note to your family doctor. And that notes actually available online for anyone who might see you in any emergency department in Alberta. And in that note will very clearly state you and I have this conversation and you really didn't want the breathing to so I reassure you, we'll do everything we can to make sure people understand you don't want that to Okay.",story,10_24,T,orq,,"यह एक शानदार सवाल है। तो प्रथम, मैं आपके पहले प्रश्न का जवाब देना चाहता था, उस पर उन बातों पर जो हम बात कर रहे थे। बिल्कुल। मैं आपके साथ सहमत हूं कि यह आपकी इच्छा है, और हम उस इच्छा का सम्मान करेंगे कि हम फिर से नहीं डालेंगे। और फिर बेशक आपका दूसरा सवाल, जो की बहुत अच्छा है, और उस साथ यह कैसे सुनिश्चित करेंगे कि यह ना होगा? तो मैं हमारी बातचीत के बाद से क्या करूंगा, और मेरे पास कुछ अधिक सवाल हैं, आपसे पूछूंगा लेकिन बातचीत के बाद, मैं एक नोट लिखूंगा जिसमे दर्ज करूंगा कि हमने जो बातचीत की थी उसमें एअर में दी गई। और आपकी वजह से कि आप नहीं चाहते, जो बेशक मेरे लिए समझ में आता है। और फिर मैं गोल्स ऑफ केयर नामक एक छोटा सा फॉर्म दर्ज करता हूं। और वैसे तो यह बहुत आसान तरीका है कि कोई भी व्यक्ति फॉर्म पर देखें और दो सेकंड में आपको आपकी इच्छा क्या है, हम आपको कॉपी देंगे जो आप घर ले जा सकते हैं। लेकिन मुझे लगता है कि यह आम तौर पर काफी नहीं होता। हम जो भी करते हैं, मैं आप से अधिकतम श्रधापूर्वक निशान घोषणा के तौर पर अपने परिवार के डॉक्टर को लिखता हूं। और वह नोट हॉस्पिटल को जाने को छोड़ देना है तो उस नोट का संस्करण ऑनलाइन है जो के किसी भी तर हंतय वा जैब आपको देखें आपकी देख बातचीत और आप उस विषय पर को जो केंटुकी। और उस नोट में स्पष्ट रूप से उँीआप से मैंनें बातचीत की हैं और आप वाकई में नाक को देना नहीं चाहते थे सो आम्रू में आप शुनोर्त आपकॉ हमारी पूरी पूरी कोशिशें के दम से आपको समझने का प्रयास करेंगे।''"
25,"All Thank you. I'm I was so concerned about that and yes, I I think I will rest now because like I say, that was a horrendous experience. And he says it won't happen again.",inactive,10_25,P,od,,"Sab dhanyawaad. Mujhe un baato ke liye bahut fikar thi aur haan, main sochti hoon ki main ab araam karungi kyunki jaisa maine kaha tha, vah ek bhayanak anubhav tha. Aur usne kaha ki yeh dobara nahin hoga."
26,"Okay. I do want to ask you just a few other questions related to this. Go ahead. And the first question might sound a little off putting, but I sort of have to ask it anytime someone is changing the kind of therapy they want. We do have to ask, how was your mood? How are you feeling?",inactive,10_26,T,irq,,"Thik hai. Mujhe tumse kuch aur sawaal puchane hai iske saath sambandhit. Aage badho. Aur pehla sawaal thoda ajeeb sa sunai de sakta hai, lekin main kosish karunga ki har baar jab koi apni therapy badalne ki baat aati hai, toh mujhe yeh puchna padta hai. Tumhara mood kaisa tha? Tum kaise mehsoos kar rahe ho?"
27,I'm I'm feeling fine. My mood is fine. I have no no problems.,story,10_27,P,id,,Main thīk thīk mehsūs kar rahā hūn. Merā mood thīk hai. Mujhe koi samasyāen nahīn hain.
28," Okay, excellent. And how are you feeling overall about life before you came into hospital? Like when you're healthy as healthy as you can be? Say a few weeks ago?",inactive,10_28,T,irq,,"Thik hai, bahut achha. Aur aap kaise mehsoos kar rahe hain jeevan ke bare mein? Jab aap swasth the, jitna swasth aap ho sakte the? Kuchh hafto pehle?"
29,"I think I am enjoying life. Okay. Yes, I am enjoying life to the to the best I can. ",inactive,10_29,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta hai ki main zindagi ka anand le raha hu. Theek hai. Haan, main zindagi ka anand utni achhi tarah se le raha hu jitna main kar sakta hu."
30,"Okay, great. Yeah. And then other related questions, we did talk about the two that we wouldn't put it in. But again, we want to make sure we know everything that you might want or not want. Okay? So if we had to give you medications to get your breathing better, is that something you'd be willing to have?",inactive,10_30,T,crq,,"Thik hai, bahut accha. Haan. Aur phir dusre se judi hui sawal, humne do se baat ki thi ki hum ise nahi daalenge. Lekin fir bhi, hum ye zaroor chahte hain ki hum sab kuch pata chale jo aap chahte hai ya nahi chahte hai. Thik hai? Toh agar aapko hum dawai deni pade"
31,"Certainly, Oh, yes. Oh, look at medication, just not the intubation.",symp/reasoning,10_31,P,cq,,"Zaroor, Oh, haan. Oh dekho dawai, bas intubation mat karo."
32,"Okay. And then usually along the lines with the intubation when people don't want the intubation, we often also want to know, if a nurse were to walk into the room and find just by bad luck, you would pass away or if someone just found you at home, who had passed away. Would you ever want people pushing on your chest and giving you shocks trying to bring you back to life?",story,10_32,T,irq,,"Theek hai. Aur normal mein jab intubation ki baat hoti hai, jab log intubation nahi chahte, humein aksar ye pata karna hai ki agar koi nurse kamre mein aati hai aur kismat se dekhti hai ki aap guzar gaye hain ya phir aapke ghar mein kisi ne aapki maut payi hai. Kya kabhi aap chahenge ki log aapke seene par dabav daale aur aapko zor se dhamake de kar apko zinda karne ki koshish karein?"
33,"No, no, no, I like I said, the good Lord knows when it's my time.",symp/reasoning,10_33,P,id,,"""Na, na, na, I like I said, good Lord jaanta hai jab meri waqt aayega."""
34,"No, and that'll make sense to me with no breathing.",inactive,10_34,T,crq,,"""Na, aur mujhe ye samajh me aayega bina saanse ki."""
35,"Yes, and I have no problems with that.",inactive,10_35,P,cd,,"जी हां, मैं उससे कोई दिक्कत नहीं है। (J"
36,"There are some other things we can do. That's not a breathing tube, but they're a little aggressive. And one is have you ever heard of bipap?",story,10_36,T,yq,,"Kuch aur bhi kaam kar sakte hain. Woh ek saans lene ka dama sa nahi hai, par woh thoda zyaada uthaau hai. Aur ek baat hai, kya tumne bipap ke baare mein kabhi suna hai?"
37,I don't think so.,inactive,10_37,P,on,,मैं ऐसा नहीं सोचता
38,"It's a mass that really pushes air into you. It's a little uncomfortable, but nothing as bad as a breathing tube. Maybe hard to answer this question, because you don't know what that is. But to have any thoughts on that, if you were really sick if we were to try just a mask, and we would do it just as long as you were okay with it and comfortable at the time,",routine,10_38,T,id,,"Yeh ek mass hai jo hava ko tumhare andar dhakel deti hai. Thodi si ancomfortable hai, lekin koi chintush nahi, vaise bura nahi jaise ek swas nali ki tarah. Shayad is sawaal ka jawab dena mushkil ho, kyunki tumhe nahi pata ki wo kya hai. Lekin us par koi vichaar rakhne ke liye, agar tum bimaar ho aur hum sirf ek mask se try kare, aur hum tab tak karengge jab tak tum iske saath theek ho aur us samay comfortable ho, to kuch bhi socho."
39,would it be for a long time?,routine,10_39,P,irq,,क्या यह लम्बे समय तक होगा?
40,"Now, usually, most times with bipap? It's only about two to six hours for most patients.",routine,10_40,T,id,,"Ab usually, sabse zaada samaan bipap ke saath time kya hota hai? Adhikansh rogiyon ke liye yeh sirf do se chaar ghante tak hi hota hai."
41,"Yeah, that would be okay with me. Okay. And if",symp/reasoning,10_41,P,ack,,"Haan, vo mere liye theek hoga. Theek hai. Aur agar."
42,"we had to put large IVs and lines into your wrist and stuff, and take you to the intensive care unit. Again, we wouldn't do breathing too, but this is just to watch you closely.",inactive,10_42,T,gc,,"Hum logo ko aapke haath mein bade IVs aur pipes daalne ke liye aur aapko intensive care unit mein le jane ke liye karna pada. Phir se, hum aapse saans lene ke liye nahi karenge, lekin yeh bas aapko nazdeek se dekhne ke liye hai."
43,"Yeah, I would be okay with that. Yes, yes. It doesn't sound invasive to me.",inactive,10_43,P,gc,,"Haan, main uske saath thik hoon. Haan, haan. Mere liye yeh ghuslauta nahi lag raha hai."
44,Okay.,inactive,10_44,T,ack,,Okay.
45,"No, I just needed to be reassured that that it won't happen again. And and yeah, I'm, I know that on my chart. It's there. Yes, yes. And that's all I need to hear because I was concerned. Okay. ",routine,10_45,P,od,,"Nahi, mujhe bas vishwaas dilana tha ki yeh fir se nahi hoga. Aur haan, main apne khatte par janti hun. Woh waha hai. Haan, haan. Aur bas yahi sunna tha mujhe kyunki main pareshaan thi. Theek hai."
46,"I do want to say that this is not set in stone, in the sense that if you ever change your mind, we can have the conversation again. But if we don't hear from you, this is what will go with no breathing to no registered in the heart. I just want you to know that in case anything were to change,",routine,10_46,T,ci,,"Main yeh kehna chahta hoon ki yeh pakki taur par nahi hai, matlab agar kabhi aap apna vichaar badal de toh hum phir se baat kar sakte hain. Lekin agar hum aapse kuch nahi sunte hain, tab yeh aapko pata chale ki kuch na kuch badal gaya hai."
47,"okay. So if I change my mind, I can I will talk to you. ",inactive,10_47,P,op,,"Okay. Agar mai apna vichaar badal leti hun, toh main aap se baat karungi."
48,Absolutely.,inactive,10_48,T,ack,,Bilkul sa
49,I don't think I'll change.,inactive,10_49,P,gc,,Main sochta hu ki main badalunga nahi.
50,"I don't think you will either. But it's just nice to see that you're aware of that. Okay. Um, honestly, I mean, there's some other questions. I tend to ask people when I don't know them. Well, just kind of routine stuff. Okay. And maybe we'll just quickly go through it go your medical history is the heart failure Anything else?",routine,10_50,T,irq,,"Mujhe lagta nahi ki tum bhi karoge. Par bas dekhna achha lagta hai ki tum us baare mein jaan gaye ho. Thik hai. Um, sach bataun toh, mere paas kuch aur sawaal hain. Main logon se yeh sawal poochta hoon jab main unhein nahi jaanta hoon. Thik hai. Aur shayad hum isse jaldi se jaldi guzar jayenge tumhara medical history hai, heart failure. Kuch aur hai?"
51,"Um, that's it. I'm beginning with an ass but I can't remember what it is.",routine,10_51,P,id,,"Are bhai, yeh toh bas hai. Main ek gadhe se shuru kar raha hun par yaad nahi aata ki woh kya hai."
52,"Okay, that's okay. We can usually we have it written down. Yeah, your medications. I think I saw you're on aspirin and two jocks and I think two others. Do you happen to know or have them written down?",routine,10_52,T,irq,,"Thik hai, voh thik hai. Ham normali likha hai. Haan, aapki dawaiyan. Main samajhti hoon aap aspirin aur do jocks par ho aur do aur. Kya aap ko pata hai ya likh kar rakha hai?"
53,You don't want I always carry this paper with me because I can't remember the name. So okay.,inactive,10_53,P,id,,Tum nahi chaahte ki main hamesha is kagaz ko apne saath rakhu kyonki mujhe naam yaad nahi ho sakta hai. To theek hai.
54,"Oh, so you are on the water pill? The furosemide. Okay, ",routine,10_54,T,yq,,"Oh, toh tu water pill par hai? The furosemide. Theek hai, na?"
55,yes.,inactive,10_55,P,ack,,haan.
56,"And. Okay, great. Yeah. Um, any allergies? ",routine,10_56,T,yq,,"Aur. Thik hai, bahut achha. Haan. Um, koi allergy hai?"
57,No.,routine,10_57,P,on,,Na hona.
58,"Okay. And I won't ask but anything that runs in your family, given your age, they told me you're 70 Is that correct? ",routine,10_58,T,yq,,"Thik hai. Aur main nahi puchungi, par koi baat jo aapke parivaar mein hota hai, aapki umar dekh ke, unhone mujhe bataya hai ki aap 70 saal ke hain. Kya yeh sahi hai?"
59,That is correct.,routine,10_59,P,ack,,Wahi sahi hai.
60,Yes. And I do have to ask the following Questions completely unrelated to what we're talking about. That's okay. Do you smoke at all?,routine,10_60,T,irq,,Haan. Aur maine poochna hai ki hum baat kar rahe hue se poori tarah se anvitti sawaal. Yeh thik hai. Kya tum cigarette peete ho?

62,drink any alcohol.,routine,10_62,T,irq,,Koi bhi alcohol piyo.
63,"No, no. ",routine,10_63,P,id,,"Hindi: नहीं,"
64,"Okay. And this will be sound crazy, but I have to ask any street drugs, illegal drugs, anything like that?",routine,10_64,T,irq,,"Theek hai. Aur yeh thoda pagal lagega, lekin mujhe poochna padega kya koi sadak ki dawa, gair-kaanooni dawa ya kuch aisi cheez hai?"
65,"No, I never had the opportunity",routine,10_65,P,id,,"Nahi, mujhe kabhi mouka nahi mila"

Thik hai, mujhe sach mei adjust karna hoga. Jaise main kehta hun, agar mujhe meri marzi hoti toh main wapas jata par shayad mujhe is par adjust karna seekhna padega. Thik hai."

78,summary,"The patient was admitted five days ago for an emergency. The patient was treated by putting a tube down their throat. The patient does not want the tube down their throat every again. The patient has a congested part failure. They had water in their lungs and stopped them from breathing properly, hence they showed up to emergency. The patient has had tube down their throat three times already. The therapist clarifies that was the only to thing to save the patient, but the patient argues that the quality of life is important more than quantity. The therapist explains making a document called goals of care which will be available to any doctor who is going to treat the patient.
