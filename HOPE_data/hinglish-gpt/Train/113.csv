And it seems to me that you've got a good grip on those. ",story,113_0,T,id,,"Toh, Felicity, maine socha ki aaj humne bahut achcha kaam kiya hai. Aur mujhe khushi hai ki tumne pichhle hafte koi panic attack nahi kiya. Bahut impress kiya. Aur tum khush lagti ho iske baare mein bhi.

3,"Yeah, yeah. But um, did I did I tell you actually, that I had an argument with my mom on Thursday. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. It was a really, really big one. Yeah, I am. Yeah. I mean, what happened was basically that mom, mom, she was just getting really angry at me for Dave again, because you know, we've been going out for three months and it's time I've told you before. Really, really, really doesn't like him.",story,113_3,P,id,,"Haan haan. Lekin um, kya maine actually tujhe bataya hai, ki maine apni mummy se Thursday ko jhagda kiya tha. Sach? Haan. Haan. Woh bahut badi thi. Haan, main hun. Haan. Arre, yeh hua tha ki meri mummy, woh bas mujhse Dave ko lekar bahut gussa ho rahi thi, kyunki pichhle tin mahine se hum dono bahar jaate aa rahe hain aur maine tumhe pehle bhi bataya hai. Sach mein, woh use bahut pasand nahi karti."
4,Ohh really?,inactive,113_4,T,crq,,Ohh sach me?
5,"Yeah. And she was, she had to go in for the drugs again. And then she was saying, you know that I can do so much better. And she was just, you know, like, Oh, I really screaming at me and I had to take all of that and, you know, people were just going around in circles in circles. And it was really, really not not very, not very good that I had listened to her saying that.",story,113_5,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan. Aur woh, woh dawai ke liye dobara jaana pada. Aur phir woh keh rahi thi, pata hai main itna behtar kar sakti hoon. Aur woh bas, pata nahi kya ho gaya tha usse, Oh, mujhe salaah de rahi thi aur mujh par gussa ho gayi thi aur mujhe sab ko sambhalna padha aur, pata nahi kyun log ghoomte firte the. Aur sachchi bataya jaye toh woh mujhe salaah dete hue sunna acchi baat nahi thi."
6," Yeah, I can imagine so he has been really upset by that.",inactive,113_6,T,id,,"Haan, main soch sakta hu ki usse bahut dukh hua hai uss baat se."
7,"Yeah, I was because, you know, she. Well, you know, that I mean, I really like Dave, I think that is really good. And, and, and, and I would, I would, I would, I would, I would like to keep on seeing him but that she disapproves of him. And I find it really hard. It's just proof of him.",symp/reasoning,113_7,P,id,,"Haan yaar, pata hai na, woh. Well, tum jante ho na, main toh Dave ko bahut pasand karti hu, mujhe woh bilkul achcha lagta hai. Aur main chahungi ki main use dekhti rahoon lekin usko yeh pasand nahi hai. Aur mujhe bahut mushkil lagti hai. Yeh toh sirf uski burai hai."
8,"Yes, I can see that really causes you more anxiety as well that this is happening and yeah, you feel criticized by your mom and perhaps torn a bit between your mom's view and David? Yeah, I do. You talk to him.",symp/reasoning,113_8,T,id,,"Haan, main dekh sakta hun ki yeh tumhe zyada chinta deti hai aur iski wajah se tumhe acupuncture kar rahe ho aur haan, tum apni maa ki taraf se professor ki salah ko follow kar rahe ho aur shayad David ke beech thoda sa phatafat rah rahe ho? Haan, main irritate ho raha hun. Tum usse baat kar lo."
9,"While she doesn't, she doesn't want me to talk to him. about it because she doesn't want him to know that she doesn't like him. And then you know, he doesn't really like her as well, because she thinks he thinks that she's a snob. And so it's really hard. You know, I just feel like I'm sort of, sort of in the middle and like in between the two of them. Yeah. But",story,113_9,P,id,-1.0,"Jab tak woh nahi chahti, woh nahi chahti ki main usse uske baare mein baat karu kyunki woh nahi chahti ki woh jaane ki woh use pasand nahi karti hai. Aur phir pata hai, use woh bhi nahi pasand hai, kyunki woh sochta hai ki woh ek snob hai. Aur isliye yeh bohot mushkil hai. Pata hai, main bas yeh mehsoos kar rahi hu ki main un dono ke beech mein aur un dono ke beech mein. Haan. Lekin"
10,"so felicity. I'm very pleased that you didn't have a panic attack last week. Yeah. And and so are you. Yeah.

13,All right. What did it do? I tell you that I had an argument with my mom on Thursday.,symp/reasoning,113_13,P,yq,,"Thik hai. Kya hua tha? Main toh bataungi, mere mom se maine Thursday ko jhagda kiya tha."
14,"No,",inactive,113_14,T,on,,Naah.
15,"yeah, an argument with mom and it was really bad because she was just yelling, yelling, yelling in your with about Dave. I've told you about Dave before because she doesn't like Dave and she was having a got me for the drug. You know, cuz he takes the drugs and she was just yelling at me because she doesn't like that he takes the drugs, but the student doesn't understand that. I mean, I just want to be with you. And so but because she doesn't like him see, you know, sister, she was yelling at me about that on Thursday,",symp/reasoning,113_15,P,id,,"Haan, meri ma ke saath ek jhagda tha aur yeh kaafi bura tha kyunki woh bas chillana, chillana aur chillana hi kar rahi thi Dave ke baare mein. Mainey tujhe pehle bhi Dave ke baare mein bataya hai kyunki usse woh pasand nahi karti aur ussey bura laga ki woh drugs ley raha hai. Tu jaanta hai, woh drugs leta hai aur isliye woh ussey daat rahi thi magar mujhse yeh baat samajh nahi aa rahi thi. Main toh bas tere saath rehna chahta hoon. Lekin kyunki usse woh pasand nahi hai dekh, tu jaanta hai, behan, woh mujhe chillane lagi thi uss baare mein Thursday ko."
16,"I can see that this is very upsetting for you. felicitated is an issue that you've raised before. So I'm wondering whether we should decide that for next week, we'll start to discuss these issues that you're having with your mom so that we can work out a plan when we've got our next session. How would that be? ",routine,113_16,T,irq,,Me dekh sakta hu ki yeh bilkul tere liye upset karne wali baat hai. Felicitated ek baat hai jo tune pehle bhi uthai thi. Isliye main soch raha hu ki kya hum agle hafte se decide karein ki hum tere mummy ke saath jo problems hai unpe discussion karenge taaki hum apne agle session mein ek plan bana sake. Tum kya kehte ho?
17,"Well, this one, this one, I mean, the argument was, when she was saying she was saying to me that I should leave him. And she was saying, you know, that I could do a lot better and that I really shouldn't be with him. And I should just leave she was saying, but you know, and then she wouldn't let me you know, because I wanted to talk to him about it, and she wouldn't let me talk to him about it. And because I really don't like each other, I just I'm really sort of stuck in the middle.",symp/reasoning,113_17,P,id,,"Well, yeh ek baat, yeh ek baat, matlab, jhagda tha, jab woh mujhse keh rahi thi ki main use chhod dena chahiye. Aur woh keh rahi thi, tu bahut accha kar sakta hai aur tu sach mein uske saath nahi hona chahiye. Woh bas keh rahi thi ki main chhod dun, par tu jaanta hai, phir bhi woh mujhe baat karne nahi deti thi, kyonki main usse is baare mein baat karna chahta tha. Aur hum dono ek doosre se nafrat hai, toh main sach mein jhel raha hoon."
18,"And I can see that that's a really big issue. So I think we definitely will put this on a number one agenda for next week. Okay. And so We'll work on a theme because this is clearly very important to you. Yeah. And I think that we're going to need a good chunk of time to be able to help you to resolve some of these issues with your mom. I can't How about during the week on? In addition to the other homework you have, you have to think about what the issues are that you would like to raise with me next week about this.",routine,113_18,T,irq,,"Aur mai dekh sakti hun ki yeh ek sachmuch bhaari samasya hai. Isliye mai aapne liye next week ki number ek chaheet per rakhungi. Theek hai. Aur hum iss prakar kaam karenge kyuki yeh aapke liye bohut mahatvapurna hai. Haan. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki aapki mummy ke saath kuch samasyao ka samadhan karne ke liye hume kafi samay ki jarurat padegi. Mai nahi kar sakti ki aap hafte ke dauraan? Iske alawa, apne doosre homeworks ke saath saath sochna hoga ki kis tarah ki samasyao ko aap mere saath next week discuss karna chahte hai."
19,"Okay. All right. So we can spend, we can spend most the next session talking about it.",inactive,113_19,P,id,,Thik hai. Bas theek hai. Toh hum agla session mein zyada time ispe baat kar sakte hain.
20,"It sounds like that's going to be a very important thing to do, because I can see how distressed This makes you feel. Okay, ready? ",inactive,113_20,T,id,,"Ye hai aisa lagta hai ki yeh ek bahut ahem kaam karna hoga, kyunki main dekh sakta hu ki aapko kitni pareshaani ho rahi hai. Theek hai, taiyaar ho?"
21,Yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay.,inactive,113_21,P,ack,,Haan. Haan. Thik hai. Theek hai.
