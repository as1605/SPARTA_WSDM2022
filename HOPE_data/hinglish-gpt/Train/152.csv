5,"Well, it might be a little worse had you know, I've been talking about my problems with the perks. The past couple of times I've seen you and I don't know I think at work, they might be starting to notice a little bit.",symp/reasoning,152_5,P,id,-1.0,"Achcha, thoda ho sakta hai ki tumhein pata ho, mai apni perks ke saath meri samasyao ke baare me baat kar raha tha. Kuchh chakkar pehle jo kabhi tumhein dekha tha aur mujhe laga ki ho shayad kaam par, unhein thoda sa pata chalne laga hai."
6,They might be starting to notice that you're under the influence of the Percocet?,routine,152_6,T,crq,0.0,Kya ve Percocet ke jaadu mein ho? Koi shak hai ki wo tumhe notice kar rahen hain?

9,"Well, yeah, because when I take them, I feel normal. Like, it makes me feel like I can function. And I feel normal. But like, definitely last week, my coworker in the cubicle across the way was she was looking at me, she was just looking at me really funny and, and then also, I've been having a little bit of trouble with the numbers. I'm just not. I'm not on my game the way I used to be. And I know that there is a connection to the drugs.",symp/reasoning,152_9,P,gc,-1.0,"Haan, haan, kyunki jab main unhe leta hu, mujhe normal hi lagta hai. Jaise, mujhe aisa lagta hai ki main kaam kar sakta hu. Aur main normal feel karta hu. Par jaise hi, pichhle hafte, meri saath waali cube mein mere saath kaam karne waali meri saathi ne mujhe dekha, woh mujhe bahut hi ajeeb si nazar se dekh rahi thi, aur phir bhi, main thoda sa pareshaan hun numbers ke saath. Main bas, apni aani mein nahi hoon, jaise pehle tha. Aur main jaanta hu ki drugs aur mere beech mein koi nata hai."
10,"So in terms of concentrating, focusing?",routine,152_10,T,crq,0.0,"Toh, concentration aur focus karne ki baat karte hain?"
11,"yeah, yeah, definitely. It's hard to focus but if I don't do it I don't know. I mean, I can barely get out of bed. I can I don't know, I'm completely what to do ",symp/reasoning,152_11,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan, haan, pakka. Focus karna muskil hai par agar main nahi karti toh mujhe kuch pata nahi. Mera matlab hai, main bed se uthne mein mushkil se kaam le sakti hun. Main kya karun, main poora taraah se confuse hun."
12,"And this is tough for you. The Percocet makes you feel normal. I would talk about this before. Yeah, it used to give you high, but not anymore.",routine,152_12,T,gc,0.0,"Aur yeh tumhara liye mushkil hai. Yeh Percocet tumhe aam-feel karata hai. Main ise pehle hi discuss karna chahunga. Haan, pehle toh yeh tumhe high deti thi, lekin ab nahi deti."
13,"No, right. It is not fun.",inactive,152_13,P,gc,0.0,"""Na, sahi hai. Yeh masti nahi hai."""
14,But it makes you feel normal.,routine,152_14,T,gc,0.0,Par tumhe normal mehsus karata hai.
15,Right.,inactive,152_15,P,gc,0.0,Theek ha
16,And we've talked about the detox options.,routine,152_16,T,gc,0.0,और हमने डिटॉक्स के विकल्पों के

18,"it's not something that you want. So really, what's changed to make things more difficult is that you're worried that your coworkers are on to you. Right. And it's your performance in terms of focusing on on your accounting work has been compromised as well. ",routine,152_18,T,gc,0.0,"Ye aisi cheez nahi hai jo aap chahte hai. Isliye haqeeqat mei, kya badlaav aaya hai jo cheezon ko mushkil bana raha hai, aap chinta mei hai ki aapke saathi aapko samajh rahe hai. Sahi. Aur aapki kaam par dhyan dene ki shamta bhi kamzor ho gayi hai."
19,Yeah,inactive,152_19,P,gc,0.0,Haan
20,is that right ?,inactive,152_20,T,crq,0.0,Kya wo sahi hai?
21,"Yeah. And when you put it that way, she's definitely noticed it and she talks to so it's not like she's if she thinks something's up. With me, she's going to keep it to herself. So that would be the reputation piece and then also, the quality of my work. I know it's, it's not the same, it's a lot harder for me to produce what I used to.",symp/reasoning,152_21,P,cd,-2.0,"Haan. Aur jab aap aise bole, toh usne zaroor notice kiya hai aur usne mujhse baat ki hai, iska matlab wo ye nahi sochti ki kuch gadbad hai. Mere saath, wo khud hi kuch nahi kahegi. Isse meri reputation par asar padega aur saath hi mera kaam ka bhi quality. Pata hai, mere liye ab kaam karna, pehle jaisa nahi hai, bohot mushkil ho gaya hai."
22,And you're afraid that's going to be noticed as well?,routine,152_22,T,yq,0.0,Aur tumhe dar hai ki yeh bhi pata chal jayega?
23,"Yeah, for sure. But I can't take detox, there's it's just not an option.",symp/reasoning,152_23,P,op,-2.0,"Haan, zaroor. Lekin main detox nahi le sakti, yeh sirf ek vikalp nahi hai."
24,"Alright. Let's talk about I want to do some scaling work. I want to talk about the importance of this change to you know, cuz we've been talking about this change for a while",routine,152_24,T,gc,0.0,"Chalo. I want to discuss the scaling ka kaam I want to do. I want to discuss the importance of this transformation to you jaanta hai, kyunki hum is transformation ke bare mein kafi der se baat kar rahe hai."
25,"that change, like giving up the Percocet. ",inactive,152_25,P,crq,0.0,"Wo badlav, jaise Percocet chhod dena."
26,"Yeah. Let's talk about, let's just talk about the importance of it though. So just focus on that one narrow piece. Okay, we're just we're just talking about how important it is. So on a scale of one to 10, with one being not important at all, and 10 being extremely important. How important is it to you that you that you can make this change? Can you make this change?",routine,152_26,T,cd,0.0,"Haan. Chalo baat karte hain, bas us ek chhitri hisse ki ahmiyat ke baare mein. Theek hai, hum sirf yahi pe baat kar rahe hain ki kitna zaroori hai yeh. Toh aapko yeh zaroori hone ka ahsaas kitna hai ek se das ke scale mein, jahan ek bilkul hi ahmiyat nahi hai, aur dus bahut zyada ahmiyat hai. Aapke liye kitna zaroori hai ki aap yeh badlav kar sakte hain? Kya aap yeh badlav kar sakte hain?"
27,"See, I go back and forth. I don't know that it's that important. Well, if I lose my job, that would be horrible. So maybe it is pretty important. I mean, it's important that I keep my job. It's really important that I keep my job, and then it keeps my reputation.",symp/reasoning,152_27,P,id,-1.0,"Dekho, main idhar udhar jaata hoon. Mujhe yeh pata nahi ki yeh kitna mahatvapurn hai. Agar main apna naukri kho doon, toh yeh bahut bura hoga. Shayad yeh kaafi mahatvapurn hai. Main manta hoon ki yeh mahatvapurn hai ki main apni naukri banaye rakho. Yeh sach mein bahut zyada mahatvapurn hai ki main apni naukri banaye rakho, aur phir meri izzat bhi banaye rakhti hai."
28,"Well, so it's important that you keep your job and that importance, in a sense now appears to be tied to the importance of not using Percocet. They've been tied together a little bit, right.",routine,152_28,T,gc,0.0,"Ab dekho, tumhari naukri bachakar rakhni zaroori hai aur uske mayne ab Percocet ka istemaal na karne ke mayne se jude huye dikhayi padte hai. Dono thode se jude hue hain, samjhe."
29,"Yeah, because to get out of bed, yeah. Okay.",inactive,152_29,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan, kyunki bed se uthna hai, haan. Theek hai."
30,"So if you if you if you had to pick a number one to 10, or 10 is extremely important. How important is it to you to make the change?",routine,152_30,T,irq,0.0,Toh agar aapko one se leke 10 tak se ek number chunna ho yaad toh bahut important hai. Aapke liye badlav laane mein kitna mahatva hai?
31,7     8     7.,symp/reasoning,152_31,P,id,0.0,Saath aath saath.
32,7 so fairly important.,routine,152_32,T,gc,0.0,7 तो काफ़ी महत्वप
33,"Alright, eight. I mean, I got to keep it up.",symp/reasoning,152_33,P,gc,0.0,"Thik hai, aathe. Mera matlab hai, mujhe ise jari rakhna padega."
34,You have to keep it up?,routine,152_34,T,crq,0.0,Tumko isko badha dena hai?
35,Yeah.,inactive,152_35,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
36,So let's talk about another construct. That's important.,inactive,152_36,T,gc,0.0,Chalo hum doosre structure ke bare mein baat karte hain. Woh mahatvapurna hai.
37,Okay.,inactive,152_37,P,gc,0.0,Theek hai
38,"I want to talk about confidence. So using that same scale, how confident are you that you can beat the Percocet?",routine,152_38,T,irq,0.0,"Mujhe confidence ke baare mein baat karni hai. Toh usi scale se, aap kitna confident ho ki aap Percocet ko hara sakte ho?"
39,That's what I've been trying to do for how long have I been coming in here?,symp/reasoning,152_39,P,crq,-1.0,That's what I've been trying to do for kitna time se main yaha pe aa raha hu?
40,About about six months now.,routine,152_40,T,cd,0.0,छ: छह महीने तक।
41,"I've tried I mean, I have really tried. I know I can't I don't I don't. I don't think I can do it.",symp/reasoning,152_41,P,id,-3.0,"Mai toh koshish kiya I mean, mai sach mein koshish kiya. Mujhe pata hai ki mai nahi kar sakta, mai nahi hoon, mai nahi kar sakta. Mai nahi lagta hai ki mai kar sakta hoon."
42,So it was in the one to 10 scale. What do you think you would be?,routine,152_42,T,irq,0.0,"Toh iski scale ek se das tak thi. Tum khyaal karte ho, tum kya ho sakte ho?"
43,Like 0   1 I can't. I've been trying.,symp/reasoning,152_43,P,id,-3.0,0सब्जैक्ट मैं नहीं कर सकता। मैं छे
44,"So very low confidence, nope really no confidence. You have no confidence. You have no confidence that you can change and it's very important to you that you do change. So this is a real bind the trend. ",routine,152_44,T,gc,0.0,"Bohot kam confidence hai, bilkul nahi hai confidence. Tumhare paas confidence nahi hai. Tumhein koi bharosa nahi hai ki tum badal sakte ho aur ye tumhare liye bahut zaroori hai ki tum badlo. Ye ek asli mushkil hai."
45,"Yeah, it's pretty depressing.",symp/reasoning,152_45,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan, yeh kaafi depressing hai."
46,You mentioned that one of the reasons your confidence is low is because you tried over the last six months and working with me and you've not been successful at stopping the Percocet use.,routine,152_46,T,gc,0.0,आपने बताया कि आपके आत्मविश्वास कम होने का एक कारण यह है कि आपने छह महीने से कोशिश की और मेरे संग काम किया और आपने परसेट उपयोग बंद करने में सफल नहीं हुए हैं।
47,"I'll leave here swearing to myself. I'm done. You know that next week I'm going to come in and I'm going to tell you that I didn't use at all and then like before, I'm in bed. I've already taken some you know that night.",symp/reasoning,152_47,P,cd,-1.0,"Main yaha se khud se kasam khake ja raha hu. Ho gaya. Tum jaante ho ki agle hafte mein aaunga aur tumhe bataunga ki maine bilkul nahi liya aur phir se pehle jaise, bistar pe hoon. Main ek baar hi liya hoon, tumhe pata hai woh raat."
48,"So it's easy to see where the low confidence rating comes in. Based on your experiences the last six months. How about other times when you've been able to make a tough change? If you look through your, your past and different experiences, has there been any other occasions where you have been successful, beating something like this and making a tough change?",routine,152_48,T,gc,0.0,"Iss se asaani se dhekha jaa sakti hai ki kam bharosa dar ka itihaas banega. Aapke anubhavon ke aadhaar par aapki pichhle chhe mahino ki vishayon ke baare mein? Kya aapne apne poorv aur alag anubhavon ke jariye kisi aur mauke mein safalta haasil ki hai, jaise is tarah se koi cheez ko jit kar aur ek muskil parivartan karne mein?"
49,"Well, yeah, I mean, I used to I used to with the gambling I guess, I I used to hit Delaware Park, you know, on a regular basis and spent a lot of money and my husband was pretty upset about it and I had a really hard time stopping that. ",story,152_49,P,id,-1.0,"Accha, haan, mujhe kya pata tha, mai gambling ke saath saath, regular basis par hi Delaware Park par jaya karta tha, aur kaafi paise kharch kiye aur mere pati ko is baat par kaafi dukh hua tha aur mai ise rokne mein bahut mushkil humein."
50,So that was those tough that was. Would you say that you felt addicted to gambling?,routine,152_50,T,yq,0.0,Woh toh woh mushkil ka tha. Kya tum kehna chahoge ki tum judva gambling ke nashe mein the?
51,"We Oh yeah, definitely.",inactive,152_51,P,op,-3.0,"Hum Oh yeah, zaroor."
52,And it was painful to stop. Are you happy that you did stop?,routine,152_52,T,yq,0.0,"Aur jab rukna pada, toh dard hua. Kya tum khush ho jo tumne ruk diya?"
53,"Oh, God, I would never want to go back to that. Yeah.",symp/reasoning,152_53,P,cd,-3.0,"Yaar bhagwan, main kabhi uss waapis jaana nahi chahta. Haan."
54,"So when you were in the middle of that addiction of gambling, right, how likely to seem that you would be able to stop back then?",routine,152_54,T,irq,0.0,"Tu jab aap uss gamble ki aadat ke beech thay, sahi hai, toh kitne zaahir lagte the ki aap uss samay rok sakenge?"
55,"Yeah, that's that's a really good point. I didn't think that I was going to be able to say probably about a to two or three. ",symp/reasoning,152_55,P,id,-3.0,"Haan, woh bahut hi accha point hai. Maine socha nahi tha ki mujhe shayad ek se do ya teen ke baare mein bolne ki salah hogi."
56,So there's some parallels here between what happened with the gambling and with what's happening now the Percocet.,routine,152_56,T,orq,0.0,"To yahaan kuch tasveerein hain uske beech, jo jua khelne ke saath hua tha aur jiska abhi Percocet ke saath ho raha hai."
57,"I didn't think about it that way. So I really didn't think I could do it then and it's been, you know, a couple years since I've even been in a casino.",symp/reasoning,152_57,P,od,-3.0,"Maine aisa nahi socha tha. Toh maine sach much aisa nahi socha ki main woh kar sakta hoon aur yeh kuch saalo se ho gaya hai, pata nahi, ek couple saal se mujhe casino mein aane ko bhi nahin hua hai."
58,So you would say you were successful at beating that addiction?,routine,152_58,T,yq,0.0,Toh kya tum kahoge ki tumne us nasha ko haraya aur kaamyabi haasil ki?
59,"Yeah, definitely.",inactive,152_59,P,op,-3.0,"Haan, zaroor."
60,"Definitely success, so what happened? ",routine,152_60,T,irq,0.0,"Pakka success, toh kya hua?"
61,It's so different. It's different. It's so different. Oh my god. Let's talk about that. Just like I just find myself popping them in my mouth. You know.,symp/reasoning,152_61,P,id,-3.0,Yeh bahut alag hai. Yeh alag hai. Yeh bahut alag hai. Omg. Chalo uske baare mein baat karte hain. Bilkul jaise main khud hi unhe apne muh mein daal leti hun. Tumhe pata hai na.
62,"So the mechanism is different. Like for the gambling, you'd have to drive to the casino to drive Delaware Park. ",routine,152_62,T,gc,0.0,"Yeh prakriya alag hai. Jaise juwaar ke liye, tumhe casino tak jaane ke liye Delaware Park mein drive karna padega."
63,Right,inactive,152_63,P,gc,0.0,Theek hai
64,You'd have to have money,routine,152_64,T,gc,0.0,Tumhe paise hona chahiye ho.
65,"Right, Right. ",inactive,152_65,P,gc,0.0,"Sahi, sahi."
66,Whereas the the percocets so easy. Yeah that you get them for my friends.,routine,152_66,T,gc,0.0,"Whereas the percocets are very easy to obtain, yeah, you can get them for my friends."
67,Yeah.,inactive,152_67,P,gc,0.0,Haan.
68,And it's a lot easier to consume and Percocet than to get in your car and make the time and so the mechanism is different.,routine,152_68,T,gc,0.0,"इसके साथ ही, इसे प्रयोग करना और परसोसेट ग्रहण करने से कार में बैठकर समय निकालना आसान होता है, जो कि मैकेनिज्म भिन्न होत"
69,Okay,inactive,152_69,P,gc,0.0,Theek hai
70,"But wonder if there's any similarities with this? Well, with the success and the potential success, meaning you you thought that you could never stop gambling, you think that you could never get through detox?",routine,152_70,T,irq,0.0,"Par kya isme kuch similarity hai? Aur haan, agar safalta aur sambhavna hai, matlab aap sochte the ki aap kabhi jua bazi nahi chhod sakte, aap sochte the ki aap detox se kabhi nikal nahi paayenge?"
71,"I didn't think about detox, but you're right. It was miserable in that period when I first stopped kind of casino and I felt that really strong urge to go. And I made it through that, my husband was amazing.",symp/reasoning,152_71,P,id,-3.0,"Maine detox ke baare mein nahi socha tha, lekin tum sahi ho. Us samay jab main pehli baar kasino se roka toh bahut dukhi tha aur mujhe kasino jaane ki bohot jaan leva iccha chal rahi thi. Lekin maine us par qaboo paaya, mere pati ne kamaal kiya."
72,You husband was supportive?,routine,152_72,T,yq,0.0,Tumhara Pati support kar raha tha?
73,"Oh yeah, he was really great. He would sit with me he would talk me through it. We go to movies sweet, you now he was really encouraging. Probably be really happy to see me stop using these Percocet too.",story,152_73,P,op,-1.0,"Haa, wah, voh sach mein bahut badiya tha. Voh mere saath baith kar mujhse baat karta tha. Hum movies dekhne jaate the, itna accha tha, pata hai voh mujhe bahut motivated karta tha. Shayad voh bahut khush hoga jab voh dekhega ki main yeh Percocet istemaal karna band kar diya hu."
74,"So as you reflect on your confidence, and this is not something you necessarily need to do right now. It's probably important to consider that you were successful before in the past. All the circumstances were different. ",routine,152_74,T,cv,0.0,"So jab aap apni khud ka bharosa parichit karte hain, aur yeh kisi ko bhi abhi karna zaruri nahi hai. Shayad iss baat ko dhyan mein rakhte hue, aapko yeh sochna mahatvapurn hai ke pehle aap pehle ki tarah kaamyaab the. Sabhi paristhiti alag thi."
75,Okay.,inactive,152_75,P,cr,0.0,Theek hai
76,But you gained too high from that gambling.,routine,152_76,T,gc,0.0,Par tum waha se bahut zyaada kamai kar liye the us jua ke khelne se.
77,Yeah.,inactive,152_77,P,gc,0.0,Haan.
78,that was it was addictive?,routine,152_78,T,crq,0.0,kya ye ki wo adiyas
79,Right,inactive,152_79,P,cd,0.0,Sahi hai
80,and and you beat it and it and it was hard it was challenging but you also have a supportive husband. Would you have your support your husband if you tried to stop Percocet?,routine,152_80,T,gc,0.0,"और एंड आप इसे हराएं हैं और यह मुश्किल था, चुनौती भरी थी लेकिन आपके पास भी सहायक पति है। क्या आप पैरोस्केट रोकने की कोशिश करें तो क्या आप अपने पति का समर्थन करें"
81,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. He He's really, you know, upset, by the way, and I'm taking them and he's really worried about me losing the job. I don't see why he wouldn't be able to help me in the same way, I guess.",symp/reasoning,152_81,P,op,-1.0,"Haan, bilkul. Woh woh, thodi bohot pareshan hai, by the way, aur main unhe le raha hoon aur woh mujhe Mera job nahi milne se bauhut chinta kar rahe hai. Main nahi samajhta ki woh mujhe utni hi madad nahi kar sakta hai, mujhe lagta hai."
82,"Well, since this since stopping is important to you, but your confidence is low. But this might be a good area to kind of process which is, you know, you do have the supports in place, and you have successfully defeated addiction before. So it's something to consider, as you weigh, you know, I know that detox is something you've expressed really clearly that you're not a big fan of and I can appreciate your reasons. At the same time, get support, you don't lose your job. So, let's do this. Let's, between now and when I see you next, maybe reflect on some of the strengths and supports and the past successes you've had. ",routine,152_82,T,gc,0.0,"Accha, kyunki yeh rokna bahut zaroori hai tumhare liye, lekin tumhari confident bahut kam hai. Lekin yeh ek acha kshetra hoga jahan tumhari tarah process kar sakte ho, yani ki dekho, tumhare paas supports hai aur tumne pehle bhi addiction ko kamyab se haraya hai. Toh yeh woh baat hai jo tum sochna chahiye, jab tum bharosa karte ho, mujhe pata hai ki detox tumhe acha nahi lagta aur main tumhare kyaaran samajh sakta hu. Lekin usi samay, support lekar job nahi haroge. Toh, karte hai. Ab, jab tak main tumhe next dekhunga, kuch strengths aur supports par vichaar karo aur jo pehle successful ho tumne."
83,Okay,inactive,152_83,P,cr,0.0,Thik hai
84,And see if we can accurately factor those into this equation. Right as you're processing through and and considering a very tough decision. So it makes sense?,routine,152_84,T,id,0.0,Aur dekho ki hum kya yeh sab sahi tarike se is equation mein shamil kar sakte hain. Jab aap ispe kaam kar rahe hai aur ek bahut badi samajhdaari se faisla soch rahe ho. Toh yeh samajh mein aata hai?
85,I can definitely do that. Yeah.,inactive,152_85,P,op,1.0,I can zaroor do that. Haan.
