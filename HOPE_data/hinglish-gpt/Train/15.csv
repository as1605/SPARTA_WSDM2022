I get everything done on time, but they're calling me inflexible and perfectionist.",symp/reasoning,15_5,P,id,,"Yaar, yeh toh mere aur mere bosses ke beech ka bhi nahi hai. Mai apni naukri mein ek accha karmchari hoon. Mai sab kaam samay par kar leta hoon, lekin unhe meri sakht aur purusharthi hone ki zaroorat hai."
6,So who's who's calling you in flux for perfectionist?,routine,15_6,T,irq,,"So, kaun kaun tumhe perfectionist ke liye flux me call kar raha hai?"
7,"Well, my boss has called me that.",routine,15_7,P,id,,"Arey, mere boss ne mujhe bulaya hai woh."

Ek nedni ghata aisa hua jab kisi ne mere saath din badlane ki ichha jatai, lekin mein unhein bata diya ki meri sheshata lena yahein par upsthit hona Mangalwar ke din hai. Tum use badal nahi sakte. Yahi to hai usmein, jaise ek safed sansaar. Mujhe Mangalwar ko kaam karna hai, tum ise badal nahi sakte.”"
9,"Well, they wanted to change. And I really don't agree with that. If they needed a certain day off, they need to go through the order of command and ask for a day off.",story,15_9,P,id,,"Well, woh badlav chahte the. Aur main unke saath bilkul sehmat nahin hun. Agar unhe kisi din ke liye chutti chahiye thi, toh woh command order ke maddhyam se jaakar chutti maang sakta hai."
10,"And they didn't do that. Instead, they asked us which day",inactive,15_10,T,crq,,"Aur woh aisa nahi kiye. Vaise, woh humse poochhe ki kaunsa din hai."
11,and then they called me inflexible because I got upset about it.,symp/reasoning,15_11,P,cd,,Phir vo mujhe inflexible bula rahe the kyunki main uske baare mein gussa ho gaya.
12,In what ways you get upset?,inactive,15_12,T,irq,,Tum kis tarah k upset ho jaate ho?
13,"Well, I told them, I said that irresponsible that they didn't think ahead that they wanted to change with me. I am there at a certain time.

I don't know why they want to upset that.",story,15_13,P,id,,"Ji, maine unse kaha, maine kaha ki bekasoor vo meri saath kuchal bread thokin nahi socha. Main kisi niras samay par hai. Main subah aath baje se shaam ko paanch baje tak hai. Mujhe dopehar mein do baje se do baje ke beech khane ki chutti hai. Yeh mera Budhvar hai. Yah hamesha se mera Budhvar raha hai. Mujhe nahi pata yeh kyun chahte hain ki main usko bigad doon."
14,"Alright, so that upsets you. And that upset them that whole incident? Yes. Anything else that your boss may have as a reason for",symp/reasoning,15_14,T,irq,,"Theek hai, toh vo tumhe mujhko roshan karte hai. Aur usko us poora ghatna se dukh hua? Haan. Kya koi aur baat hai jiski bajah se tumhare boss ko ho sakta hai?"
15,"they call me a perfectionist because I like the things done by the book, which I think makes me a great worker, because I get everything done. You know, on deadlines, not before, not after, right on the deadline. And everything is just exactly, you know, everything's filed. Everything's organized. And some people like to, you know, take a file online, you this to fill out a report and it's there. It's in the file. You can't touch it, you can't move it. That's where it needs to be.",story,15_15,P,id,,"Wo mujhe perfectionist kehte hain kyunki mujhe book ke according kaam karne ka shauk hai, jiski wajah se mai ek mahan kaamgaar ka darja haasil karta hu, kyunki mujhe sab kuch karne mein safalta milti hai. Pata hai, deadlines par, na pehle, na baad mein, bilkul deadline ke saath sahi waqt par. Aur sab kuch bilkul, pata hai, sab kuch file ki tarah hai. Sab organized hai. Aur kuch log ko pasand hota hai, pata hai, online file banaake, report bharne ke liye, aur wohi file mein hoti hai. Usmein touch nahi kar sakte, nahi move kar sakte. Wahi jagah pe hona chahiye."
16,So you need to self fairly well organized as employee.,routine,15_16,T,crq,,Toh tumhe khud ko kaafi achhe se employees ki tarah well-organized rehna chahiye.

21,"Oh, 000. You know, on there, eight to five, eight o'clock in the morning to five, I wake up at six. I get ready. I leave for work at seven. I get there at eight. Every, the whole day has a schedule. And I meet that schedule. And it's the best thing for me.",routine,15_21,P,id,,"Arre, 000. Tu pata hai, wahaan pe, olive se paanch tak, saat baje uth ke, chhe baje mein mai uth jaata hoon. Main taiyaar ho jaata hoon. Saat baje kaam ke liye chhodta hoon. Paanch mein pahunch jaata hoon. Har, poora din ka ek schedule hota hai. Aur main us schedule ko poora karta hoon. Aur ye mere liye sabse achchi cheez hai."
22,So this is this is frustrating for you that your coworkers can understand where you're coming from.,symp/reasoning,15_22,T,orq,,So yeh yeh toh tumhare liye frustrating hai ki tumhare coworkers ko samajh aa raha hai ki tum kahaan se aa rahe ho.
23,"I just don't get it. You know, I'm doing everything by the book by the Vols. And I'm in trouble somehow. Something's wrong with me because I do it right I do it the right way. And that's wrong somehow, and I don't get it.",routine,15_23,P,od,,"Mai samajh hi nahi pa raha hu. Pata hai, main sab kuch Vols ki kitaab ke mutabik kar raha hu. Lekin kisi tarah musibat mein fasa hu. Shayad mere mein kuch galti hai kyunki main sahi tarike se kar raha hu. Aur woh galti hai kisi tarah, aur mujhe samajh nahi aa raha hai."
24,"Have you ever had to work in a, like a group like team with any of your coworkers?",routine,15_24,T,irq,,"Tumne kabhi kabhi apne saath kaam karna pada hai, jaise ek team mein, apne kisi saporday ke saath?"
25,"They've made me but I don't like it. Because I know the way we need to do things. If we're given a project, okay? It starts with A, B, C, D, and then no, everybody wants Oh, let's do c o, d, and then F. No, no, no, no, A, B, C, D, there is no deviation from that. And then they get mad at me.",story,15_25,P,id,,"उन्होंने मुझे बनाया है लेकिन मुझे यह नहीं पसंद है। क्योंकि मुझे पता है कि हमें कैसे काम करना है। अगर हमें एक परियोजना दी गई है, ठीक है? वह A, B, C, D से शुरू होती है, और फिर नहीं, सबको चाहिए ओह, हम c o, d करें और फिर F. नहीं, नहीं, नहीं, नहीं, A, B, C, D से हमें कोई भ्रम नहीं होना चाहिए। और फिर वे मुझसे गुस्सा हो जाते हैं।"
26,"So, working in groups hasn't worked out too well for you.",symp/reasoning,15_26,T,orq,,"Toh, ek-dusre ke saath kaam karna tumhare liye achha nahi nikla."
27,"Not really, not less. People listen to me.",inactive,15_27,P,od,,"बिल्कुल नहीं, कम नहीं। लोग मेरी बात सुन"
28,"So in instances where people listen to how have things worked out,",story,15_28,T,crq,,"So jab log sunte hai ki kaise chal raha hai,"
29,"if I oversee everything, I still get on uncomfortable because, you know, they're out of my sight. I don't know what they're doing. Sometimes, you know, I have to watch person, you know, one person, other persons over there. I don't know what they're doing. And if it's not done, right, it's not done right. And that's bad.",story,15_29,P,cd,,"Agar main sab kuch nazar rakhta hoon, toh mujhe ab bhi akal thodi bahut parshan hoti hai, kyunki pata hai na, woh mere nazar se bahar hain. Mujhe nahi pata woh kya kar rahe hain. Kabhi kabhi, mujhe ek vyakti ko dekhna padta hai, aur dusre vyaktiyon ko vahan. Mujhe nahi pata woh kya kar rahe hain. Aur agar woh sahi tarah se nahi kiya gaya, toh woh sahi tarah se nahi kiya gaya. Aur yeh bura hai."

31,"No particular I get, I guess I feel anxious sometimes when things aren't going the way they need to go. Because then it puts off the whole day. And that does, I guess I would, I would consider that, you know, anxiety because if it's not going the right way, one thing goes wrong, the whole day is thrown off. And then now I have to deal with that. Now I have to adjust my whole schedule, environment, and that has caused me anxiety, even by men, even by a minute",story,15_31,P,id,,"Koi particular mujhe milta hai, mujhe lagta hai kabhi kabhi jab cheezein apne tarike se nahi ja rahi hain. Kyunki uske baad pure din ka kharaab ho jata hai. Aur ye toh, mujhe lagta hai, main ye sochungi, aap jante hain, anxiety kyunki agar sahi tarike se nahi chal raha hai toh ek cheez galat jaati hai, pura din kharab ho jata hai.

You know, I need to schedule my day around the meeting. He wants scheduled meeting at 1220. And I told him, I'm at lunch 12 to 1230. Why do you think that's appropriate? I mean, sometimes I feel like I'm the only smart person there and the only person who knows how this needs to run.",routine,15_33,P,id,,"Vo vo bhai yeh karne pe amirzad aih, usko schedule karna hoga kuch, kuch u schedule na karne wale meetings. Aur maine, maine usually maine try kiya usse approach karke aur kaha, tu dekh, ek meeting hai, hume iske baare mein pata hona chahiye.
