Dhanyavaad poochne ke liye. Bahut accha chal raha hai. Aaj maine aapke bhai ko jaldi aane wapas jaate hue dekha. Aur unhe pareshani hai ki aapne spin kaise hataya.
3,"I mean, I don't know why because I mean it's been awesome for like a week I've been getting so much done. You know at work, I finished both reports that I've been working on. And even at home, like I've had tons of time to clean my house and get caught up on actually making my house what I want it to be and just Working on in general and it's clean. And I mean, I haven't had any issues.",story,50_3,P,id,,"Maine manta hu, mujhe pata nahi kyun kyunki hafton se yeh bahut khushkar tha ki maine bahut kaam kar liya hai. Tumhe pata hai, kaam par maine dono reports jin par kaam kar raha tha, wo khatam kar di. Aur ghar par bhi, maine apne ghar ko saaf karne aur apne ghar ko waise banana ke liye bahut saara samay mila aur bas kaam par dhyan diya aur ghar saaf hai. Aur Maine koi bhi samasya nahi hui hai."

5,"I mean, they have. I haven't been sleeping as much. I haven't needed it really. I only need a few hours, it seems like but it's been fine because I haven't been tired. I haven't been, you know, irritable or anything during the day and at night, I get a few artists late, but the rest of the time I'm like, you know, either working on work or my house or whatever. So I mean, I've slept like in less but it's not an issue.",story,50_5,P,id,,"Mai bas, unke paas toh hai. Mai utna soya nahi hai. Mujhe sach mein zarurat nahi thi. Sirf kuch ghante ki need hai mujhe, aisa lagta hai lekin problems nahi hui kyuki mai thakan mehsoos nahi kar raha tha. Din mein gussa ya kuch bhi nahi tha aur raat mein, kuch kalakaar der se aate hai, lekin baki samay mein mai kaam par kaam kar raha hu ya fir mera ghar ya kuch aur. Toh mai bas kuch kam time mein soya, lekin koi pareshaani nahi hai yeh."

10,You mentioned you get a lot of things done at work. How about at home?,routine,50_10,T,crq,,आपने कहा कि आप काम पर बहुत कुछ करते हैं। घर पर कैसा है?
11,"Yeah, I mean, so my daddy room, I feel like more in new China and stuff like that. So I've gotten everything set up. You know, I hadn't finished unpacking all my boxes from when I moved in. So I've gotten all the boxes on packed. You know, even like things like placemats and whatever, like, it looks like a home now and I'm really liking what I'm doing",story,50_11,P,cd,,"Haan, main toh keh raha hoon, mere papa ki kamra mein, mujhe lag raha hai ki yahan nayi China jaisa lag raha hai aur kuch aise samaan. Main sab theek se set up kar chuka hoon. Pata hai, main jab ghar mein shifted hua tha tab se main abhi tak sabhi peti bhar unpacking nahi kar paaya tha. Lekin ab sabhi petiyon ka unpacking ho gaya hai. Pata hai, jaise placemats wagerah, ab yahan ghar lagne laga hai aur mujhe woh kaam jo kar raha hoon, bahaut pasand aa raha hai."
12,"if you're accomplishing you're accomplishing a lot. Know, when your brother can brush in, he'd mentioned some shopping and that's one of the things he was certain about.",routine,50_12,T,gc,,"Agar tum kuch kar rahe ho tab tum bahut kuch kar rahe ho. Aur, jab tumhara bhai aanewala hai, to usne shopping ke bare mein bataya tha aur woh ek cheez thi jiske baare mein woh bilkul pakka tha."
13,"Yeah, well, so I on the weekend, I had gone ahead and when shopping and I kind of went on a shopping spree. And I had bought, like I said, my new China and I got some kitchen utensils too and a couple things for around the house like home decor. And I called him because I had ran out of space to take everything I was at the mall. So I was hitting a lot of different stores. And I've run out of space to put everything in because I really wanted to actually get a new dining room set like tables and chairs and maybe a cabinet and he has an SUV. So I called him to see if he could come in so I could purchase the items but he said he wasn't he couldn't come out and I guess he kind of said he was worried about you spending that much money. Which I don't know. I don't know why he would be just from me calling him but I think that's why he was concerned it but he didn't come I didn't get the dining room set or anything.",story,50_13,P,ack,,"Haan, toh, aisa ki mere weekend par main shopping ke liye gaya tha aur maine ek shopping spree par bhi gyaan liya. Aur jaise maine kaha tha, maine apne naye China ko kharida aur kuch kitchen utensils bhi liye aur kuch ghar ke liye cheezein liye jaise home decor. Main usse call kiya kyonki mujhe maloom tha ki main apne mall par sab kuch lekar gya tha. Toh maine bahut se alag-alag stores pe jaake dukan's pakdam pakdai ki. Aur mujhe kuch space nahi mil raha tha jismein main sab kuch rakh sakun kyunki main asal mein ek naya dining room set chahiye tha jismein tables aur chairs hote aur shayad ek cabinet bhi. Aur uske paas SUV tha. Toh maine usse call kiya ki kya woh aa sakte hain taaki main items purchase kar sakun lekin woh kehne lage ki woh bahar nahi aa sakte aur main samajh sakta tha ki unhe may be tera bahut paisa kharch hoga isliye bhi aur main naya naya cooking set kharidne gaya tha. Lekin woh aaye nahi aur maine dining room set ya kuch bhi nahi liya."
14,You remember how much you spent,routine,50_14,T,irq,,Tum yaad rakhoge ki kitna kharcha kiya tha?
15,"I don't know exactly, because there's lots of different stores. But, you know, I have a couple different credit cards. So one credit card I used was declined by the end. So it was probably, you know, I didn't need to get the dining room set. I could have used a different credit card, but obviously it's been enough.",story,50_15,P,id,,"Mujhe sahi tareeke se nahi pata, kyunki bohot saare alag-alag stores hai. Lekin, dekho, mere paas kuch alag-alag credit cards hai. Toh ek credit card jo mein ne use kiya tha, woh end tak decline ho gaya tha. Toh shayad, maloom hai, mujhe dining room ka set lena zaroori nahi tha. Mein koi aur credit card use kar sakti thi, lekin obvious ki yeh kaafi tha."
16,"Dude, I feel like you spent more than you usually would spend a trip to the mall.",routine,50_16,T,crq,,"Bro, I am feeling ki tere dwara kharcha kiya gaya jo trip mall ki taraf usual se jyada tha."
17,"I never really go on shopping sprees. And I really treat myself like that. So I mean, yes. But I again like I haven't, you know, I needed all those things that I got from my apartment.",story,50_17,P,cd,,"Main visitor hi nahi ana hai shopping par. Aur main apne aap ko aise hi pamper karti hu. Toh matlab haan. Lekin fir bhi mujhe nahi chahiye tha, pata hai, mere naye ghar se jo maine cheezein li thi."
