0,How many times have you gone to work and made a mistake?,routine,131_0,T,irq,,Tumne kitni baar kaam pe jaake galti ki hai?
1,"I don't know. I mean, I guess none technically none that have been something I've gotten trouble for anything like that. Sometimes it's hard to tell because you know, you don't always hear from people afterwards. You can't really tell was it a mistake or not. But I guess none that it had like any major consequences.",symp/reasoning,131_1,P,id,1.0,"Mujhe nahi pata. Matlab, shayad technically koi nahi hai jo mujhe kisi pareshani mein daal diya ho ya us tarah ki kuch baat hai. Kabhi kabhi samajh mein nahi aata kyunki aap jaante ho, log baad mein humse nahi milte. Main nahi bata sakti ki kya ye galti thi ya nahi. Lekin mujhe lagta koi bhi aisi galti nahi thi jiske bade nateeje hue ho."
2,"So none, but there might be a few small ones that you've just never found out about. So Less than a 10th of a percent days you come in probably very small, really, really small. The probability of a statement that you're making being true, is pretty low. The seventh thought rather, I'm going to make a mistake. Probably not supported by the evidence.",routine,131_2,T,id,,"Toh kul na, par kuch chhote chhote ho sakte hain jiske baare mein aap kabhi pata nahi lagaye. Toh dasvi hisse se kam ke din aap aate ho, bahut chote ya bahut hee chote. Aapki diye hue statement ka sambhavna sach hone ki, kaafi kam hai. Saatva vichar mein, mujhe galti hogi. Sabut ke aadhaar par shayad yeh baat sahi na ho."
3," Yeah, I guess that's true. ",inactive,131_3,P,ack,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki wahi sacch hai."
4,"So, the automatic thought is not accurate and not useful. I just got a couple strikes against it. But it is the thought you're having so let's deal with it. I'm going to make a mistake. So what could you tell yourself as the first part of that adaptive response, which acknowledges that fear that's realistic, that acknowledges that fear of making a mistake",symp/reasoning,131_4,T,id,,"Toh, yeh automatic soch galat hai aur faydemand nahi hai. Mujhe uski khilaaf do strike mil gaye hai. Lekin yeh woh soch hai jo tum soch rahe ho toh isse deal karte hai. Main ek galti karunga. Toh kya tum apne aap ko uss adaptive response ki pehli bhag ke roop mein kya keh sakte ho, jo realistic hai iss dar ko accept karne ke liye, galti karne ka?"
5,I guess like it Everybody makes mistakes.,inactive,131_5,P,id,-2.0,Mujhe lagta hai ki sabko galatiyan hoti hai.
6,"Everybody makes mistakes. I could make a mistake today, but it's unlikely that that also be accurate. So everybody makes mistakes. I could make a mistake, but it's probably not gonna happen. Rather than I'm going to make a mistake. So you're going to have that automatic thought either way, likely for a while until you start to apply these adaptive responses. So this is what we're working on is your response. So everybody makes mistakes, I could make a mistake probably not going to happen. And will could be a next part, which is realistic, but also positive. That can help get you past the reaction of being late morning.",routine,131_6,T,id,,"Sabhi sabhi galtiyaan banate hain. Main aaj ek galti kar sakta hoon, par uska sach hona bahut mushkil hai. Toh sabhi galtiyaan bnate hain. Main galti kar sakta hoon, par ye hone ka zyada chance nahi hai. Kisi ke toh bhi maar se toh galti karne ki yahi rehti hai, shayad kuch waqt tak. Par jab tak aap adaptive responses ko apply karna shuru nahi karenge, aapko yehi reaction aayega. Isiliye hum aapki response par kaam kar rahe hain. Har kisi ko galtiyaan banta hai, main bhi galti kar sakta hoon par shayad yeh nahi hoga. Agar realistic ho aur saath hi positive bhi ho, toh aapko late morning ko overcome karne mein madad mil sakti hai."
7,I'm a good caseworker and I need to do my job so I can help other people and it's going to be okay.,symp/reasoning,131_7,P,id,,Main ek ache caseworker hun aur main apna kaam karna chahta hun taaki main dusron ki madad kar sakun aur sab thik ho jaye.
8,"Okay, so there's a few few elements in there. It's going to be okay, I need to do my The job I help people all those all those are true So applying as you know even as you say this year with me as you say, it's gonna be okay I need to my shop. What are we actually having right now?",routine,131_8,T,id,,"Thik hai, toh kuch kuch baatein hai usme. Sab thik hoga, mujhe apni kaam karma hai, main logon ki madad karta hoon aur ye sab sach hai. Isiliye main apply kar raha hoon, jaise aap jaante ho, is saal meri saath hi hai aur jaise aap kehte ho, sab thik hoga. Mujhe apni dukan par jaana hai. Abhi hamare paas kya hai?"
9,I mean it feels a little better but it's hard you know so I felt still feel like it's dangerous I might make a mistake but I guess it helps a little bit,symp/reasoning,131_9,P,id,-2.0,"Mere liye to thoda sa acha lag raha hai par samajhna mushkil hai na, toh mujhe aisa lag raha hai ki ye khatarnaak hai aur galti ho sakti hai, par maan liya ki thoda sa madad karti hai."
10,Can you see yourself being able to in the moment and I realize this is difficult but in the moment of having that on that thought and that word come in. Can you see yourself applying this self talk?,routine,131_10,T,id,,"Kya tum khud ko us waqt dekh sakte ho jab main aapko hai ek chunauti de rahi hu, lekin aap us chunauti ke dauran apne vichar aur shabdonka upyog kar sakoge?"
11,"Yeah, I think I probably will because now it will be hard to have those thoughts and not think of you . Okay, I need to calm myself down a little bit.",symp/reasoning,131_11,P,op,-2.0,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai main shaayad kar dungi kyunki ab woh vichaar rakhna mushkil ho jayega aur tere baare mein na sochna mumkin nahi hoga . Thik hai, mujhe apne aap ko thoda sambhalna padega."
12,And you've already used self talk on your own before even knew about these?,routine,131_12,T,yq,,"Aur tumne apne aap pehle se hi self talk ka upyog kiya hai, iss baare mein pata bhi na tha?"
13,Yeah. It did help in the past.,routine,131_13,P,op,,Haan. Yeh pehle se madad kar gaya tha.
14,"A lot of the corsage to some of the effectiveness of this is based on your ability in that moment to take a step back and follow the training. Right, just like many professionals, professionals depend on their training to help them make the correct intervention correct decision. So think of this kind of like something you've learned in the training. This is a self talk. It's pre packaged, it's ready to go. You can even have it written down. Okay? Doesn't have to be short. It can be like a paragraph, or more if you want as a matter of following the protocol. Once you have the automatic thought, it's easy to descend into worry and fear. You're just looking too quick to grab a moment in there. Apply this treatment strategy. Does that make sense? Sometimes it's likely Well, most of the time, I think you would you would be able to do this. Sometimes you probably won't as important in those moments to not get discouraged. Right. So you can have a self talk for that to write something like Dr. Crowley said it was likely that once a while I wouldn't build do this.",routine,131_14,T,id,,"Translation:

Is sentence ko hinglish mein badal ke ensure karo ki uska matlab sahi hai

Iss mein bahut saara haath hai effectiveness mein, aur woh tumhari ability pe based hai ki tum uss waqt pe kis had tak peeche jaa sakte ho aur training ko follow kar paao. Sahi, jaise ki professionals bahut saara depend karte hai apne training pe, taki woh sahi intervention aur sahi decision le sake. Toh iss tarah se socha jaa sakta hai ki yeh ek aisi cheez hai jo tumne training mein seekhi hai. Yeh khud se baat karna hai. Yeh pre-packaged hai, aur taiyaar hai jaane ke liye. Isse likh kar rakh sakte ho bhi. Theek hai? Yeh chota hona zaroori nahi hai. Ek paragraph bhi ho sakta hai, ya aur bhi zyada, bas ke protocol ko follow karne ka mamla hai. Jab tumhe automatically thought aa jaaye, toh aasaani se worry aur fear mein jaa sakte ho. Tum bas woh pal jaldi se pakadne ki koshish karte ho. Is treatment strategy ko apply karo. Kya yeh samajh mein aata hai? Kabhi kabhi toh ho jata hai, bahut saare baar toh mainaun kehte hain tum yeh kar paoge. Kabhi kabhi nahi kar paaoge, tab bhi important hai uss waqt demoralized na ho jaana. Theek hai? Toh tumhaare paas uss ke liye bhi khud se baat karne ka mauka hai, kuch aisi cheez likh sakte ho jaise Dr. Crowley ne bataya tha ki kabhi kabhi ho sakta hai ki main yeh nahi kar paaunga."
15,it's not gonna work every time.,symp/reasoning,131_15,P,id,,Ye har baar kaam nahi karega.
16,Make sense?,inactive,131_16,T,crq,,Hinglish translation: Kuch sam
17,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.",inactive,131_17,P,cd,,"Haan, wo bahut sense karta hai."
18,"So it's the chaos of life, right in the chaos of emotions that sometimes interfere. the more times you have success, that that seems to be tied with a better chance of improving and reduction of symptoms, but allow yourself failures. Well, it's what I would expect from anybody trying to untangle all these feelings and thoughts. There's not gonna be a perfect connection between that automatic thought and applied self talk. Okay, so be easy on yourself as soon as you can,",routine,131_18,T,id,,"Toh yeh zindagi ka hahakaar hai, jahaan kai baar emotions ki hulchul kuchh baar raaste mein badhaav daalte hain. Jo zyada kaamyabi ho, usse saath hi behtar mauka hota hai ki symptoms mein kami aa jaaye, lekin apne aap ko haarnish let kar dekho. Theek hai, yahi toh main kissi bhi vyakti se ummeed karta hu jo inn saare ehsaas aur khayalon ko suljhaane ki koshish kar raha hai. Us automatic soch aur lagu kiye jaane wale khud ki baat mein koi poora rishta nahi hoga. Accha, toh apne aap ko asaani se samajhe jaise hi tum ho sake,"
19,"that makes sense because like, if you could just flip a switch you I would only have to have one therapy session.",symp/reasoning,131_19,P,id,,यह समझने योग्य है क्योंकि अगर आप केवल एक स्विच फ्लिप कर सकते हो तो मुझे केवल एक थेरेपी सत्र करने की आवश
20,"It'd be good shape, right? so it's a little more difficult than that. But overall, this these strategies are fairly straightforward. And you can definitely learn them and you can definitely do them. I want you to have that confidence. It's, it's normal to have mistakes occur. And to not always do it as you need to as you want to, but in the end, overall, you should be able to be able to apply them and actually It'll get easier in the future to develop your self talk for different thoughts. Okay?",routine,131_20,T,id,,"Ye acchi shape hogi, na? toh yeh thoda zyada mushkil hai usse. Lekin overall, yeh strategies kaafi seedhe hai. Aur aap zaroor seekhenge inko aur kar sakte hai. Mujhe chaahiye ki aapko uss vishwaas se ho. Yeh, yeh normal hai ki galtiyaan ho jaaye aur hamesha waise hi naa karen jaise aapko chahiye, lekin ant mein, overall, aap unko laga sakte hai aur actually aage jaake aapke liye asaan ho jayega apne khud ke thoughts ko develop karne mein. Theek hai?"
