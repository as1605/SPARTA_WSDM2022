Mujhe lagta hai yeh ek aur vikalp ho sakta hai. Clearly, humare chinta yeh hai ki hum aapko lambi samay tak sleeping tablets par nahi dekhna chahte kyunki yeh un par dependent aur un par nirbhar hone ke baare mein samasyayein paida kar sakta hai.

Mujhe lagta hai ki yeh ek acchi idea hai. Kya tum surgery mein yahaan ke counselor se milna pasand karoge?"
53,Yes. That'd fine,routine,195_53,P,op,,Haan. Wahi sahi hai.
54,"Okay, so I can organize that I can speak to her and ask her to contact you to make an appointment.

59,I am mess,symp/reasoning,195_59,P,id,,Main hu mess.
60,is sounds to me. Self esteems taking a real not because I certainly think the help we can give you with some counts in which we have a counselor that comes here in the surgery that will be it'll be a benefit to you. And then we'll try the short course of sleep tablets to try and get you back into a state sleep pattern.,routine,195_60,T,id,,यह मेरे लिए सुनाई देता है। खुद की सम्मान किसी असली कारण से नहीं है क्योंकि मैं निश्चित रूप से सोचता हूँ कि हम आपकी मदद कर सकते हैं जिसमें कई मामलों में हम एक सलाहकार हैं जो यहां सर्जरी में आते हैं वह आपके लिए एक लाभ होगा। और फिर हम आपको वापस नींद की अवस्था में ला सकने के लिए शॉर्ट कोर्स के साथ नींद की गोल
