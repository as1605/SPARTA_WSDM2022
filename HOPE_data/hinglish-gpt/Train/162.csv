82,"Like I said, before you leave today, we'll break those down. So you can, you could have written down as you go out. I think it's important, because the automatic thoughts tend to spring on us quickly. It's important to rehearse these adaptive responses. So we're ready to go. ",routine,162_82,T,id,0.0,"Jaisa maine kaha, jab tum aaj jaaoge, hum usko tod denge. Taki tum jaisi jaate ho, tum usse likh sakte the.

84,"Right. And, and kind of, you know, we're being we're preparing ourselves to apply that adaptive response. And in order to be prepared you, you have to know what it is. So it's good to have it written down to kind of more or less commit to memory. ",routine,162_84,T,gc,0.0,"Right. Aur, aur ek tarah se, pata hai, hum apne aap ko tayyar kar rahe hain us adaptive pradarshan ko apply karne ke liye. Aur taiyaar hone ke liye, aapko pata hona chahiye kya hai.

87,Yeah.,inactive,162_87,P,op,0.0,Haan.
88,"All right. So, before we leave today, I'll take care of that. And I want you to use as adaptive responses for this week. I'll see you next week. And record what the outcome Was every time you're able to apply the response, and that includes what you felt and what you actually did. ",routine,162_88,T,gc,0.0,"Thik hai. Toh, aaj hum jaane se pehle main uska dhyaan rakh loonga. Aur main chahta hoon ki tum is hafte ke liye apne jawaabon ko istemaal karo. Main tumhe agle hafte miloonga. Aur jab bhi tum jawaab lagao, uska natija kya tha, woh har baar record karo, jisme tumne kya mehsoos kiya tha aur kya kiya tha."

92,"Yeah. Once you're consciously controlling, and then any feelings, okay? And we'll go through them. We'll go through each time use it one by one, they have a there are and kind of see if we need to adjust the adaptive response and see how well it's working. Okay. That's the plan.",routine,162_92,T,gc,0.0,"Yeah. Once you're conscious, and then any feelings, okay? Aur hum in sab par se guzarnege. Ek ek karke istemal karenge, aur dekhenge ke kya hume adaptive response ko adjust karna chahiye aur dekhenge ke kya woh kaam kar raha hai. Thik hai. Yahi hamara plan hai."
93,Yeah. I think that will be helpful,inactive,162_93,P,gc,0.0,Haan. Main sochta hoon ki woh madadgar hoga.
