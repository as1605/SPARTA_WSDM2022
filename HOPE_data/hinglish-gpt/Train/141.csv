27,Yeah. That's really is.,inactive,141_27,P,op,-2.0,Haan. Wahi toh sach hai.
28,"So it could be is that this thought of, I'm going to get this item wrong is leading to these uncomfortable feelings, the physical feelings. All right.

What happens then?",routine,141_28,T,crq,0.0,"Toh iska matlab yeh ho sakta hai ki ye soch, ki main yeh cheez galat karoonga, ye kaaran hai inn bechain karne waali bhavnaon ka, yeh sharirik ehsaas. Thik hai. Toh jab aap pehle sawaal ka jawab dete hai, toh aapko turant pata nahi chalta ki aapne sahi ya galat jawaab diya hai kyunki yeh kagaz aur pencil mein hai.

40,"There's gonna be one that's maybe a little more difficult or difficult for you. So it seems like what you're saying is that when you reach that item where you have that thought, from from that point on the next item is, is more difficult because you're having a similar thought Does that pattern continue? ",routine,141_40,T,gc,0.0,"Tere liye ek aisa hoga jo shayad tumhare liye thoda mushkil ya difficult ho sakta hai. To lagta hai ki tum keh rahe ho ki jab tum us cheez tak pahunchte ho jahan par tumhare pass wo khayal hai, uske baad wale item mein, wo zyada difficult ho jata hai kyunki wahi khayal tumhe aa raha hai. Kya ye pattern jaari hai?"
41,throughout test? Yes.,story,141_41,P,crq,0.0,test ke dauran? Haan.
42,"So explain to me what like, let's just go with the example, the first item like, because just just to keep it more simple. So you have the first item. And that didn't work out for that thought, right? The second one your thought was, I have even greater chance of missing. So what happens after you respond to that second item?",routine,141_42,T,gc,0.0,"Toh explain karo na mujhe ki jaise hum example le lete hain, pehla item hai waisa, kyonki uss ko simple rakhne ke liye. Toh tumhare paas pehla item hai. Aur woh kaam nahi kiya uss baat se, sahi kiya? Dusra tumhara khayaal tha, mujhe zyada chance lag raha hai miss hone ka. Toh phir kya hota hai jab tum dusre item pe response karoge?"

Main shaant hoke ek bhi ho gaya hoon agar hai toh haan, agar pehla nahi toh main shaant hoke zero par pahunch gaya hoon aur mujhe ek gadbad darje hasil hui hai."

53,Mm hmm. Yeah.,inactive,141_53,P,cd,-1.0,Hnmm. Haan.
54,"So when you just when you're saying panic, the panics really occurring a few items in after you have the first one that you thought you've missed.",routine,141_54,T,crq,0.0,"Agar jab aap panic ki baat kar rahe hai tab panic sach mein kuch saman baad mein ho raha hai, jab aapne pehla saman miss kiya tha jis par aapko laga tha ki aap ne usse miss kar diya hai."
55,Mm hmm.,inactive,141_55,P,cd,-1.0,Haan haan.
56,"And this has been happening for a while, as you described, right?",routine,141_56,T,crq,0.0,"Aur yeh ek samay se ho raha hai, jaise aapne bataya hai, sahi to?"
57,Yeah.,inactive,141_57,P,cd,-1.0,Haan.
58,"Well, how about your grades? How have you actually been doing on the quizzes?",routine,141_58,T,irq,0.0,"Aur, tumhare grades kaise hai? Tum quizzes par actual mein kaise perform kar rahe ho?"
59,I've been a pretty solid B student.,symp/reasoning,141_59,P,id,0.0,मैं अब तक एक अच्छा स्टूडें

I don't know how it translates.",symp/reasoning,141_61,P,gc,-1.0,"So maira matlab hai ki maine jo kiya hai usse acche se karna chahti thi. Mujhe A grade milte toh aur accha lagta, lekin yeh bhi thik hai. Lekin jab main iss baat ko leke chalti hun toh yeh nahi hota hai. Mujhe pata nahi ki isse kya hota hai."

Mujhe lagta hai ki main padhai karne mein kaafi kaargar hoon. Maine yeh bhi pata kiya hai ki kya kaam nahi karta hai. Isliye, main chapter padhkar, outlines banakar aur flashcards review karke padhai karne ki koshish karta hoon, jisse maine sabse achhe natije paaye hain."

",routine,141_64,T,crq,-1.0,"Thik hai, toh tumhare study habits acche hai. Aur tumhari quiz scores bhi acchi hai. Par kya tumhe ab bhi quizzes lene ke baad ye pareshan karne wale khyaal aur aapke sharir mein aaye asahaj aahatein ho rahi hai?"
65,Yeah.,inactive,141_65,P,cd,-1.0,Haan.
66,Is that about right?,inactive,141_66,T,crq,0.0,Kya woh sahi hai?
67,"Yeah, that's absolutely right.",inactive,141_67,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan, wahi bilkul sahi hai."

So how you how you're reacting to the quizzes maybe.",routine,141_68,T,id,0.0,"Toh sach mein, tum ko apni performance ko badalne ki zaroorat nahi hai. Tumhe bas apne khayal, ehsaas aur vyavahar ko badalne ki zaroorat hai. Haan. Toh tum kaise quizzes ke reaction pe react kar rahe ho."
69,"Yeah, cuz I get B's like I said so Yeah.",symp/reasoning,141_69,P,id,-1.0,"Haan, kyunki main B grade laata hu, jaise maine kaha tha, toh haan."
70,And B is good.,routine,141_70,T,crq,0.0,Aur B to accha hai.
71,Yeah.,inactive,141_71,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
72,"So Alright, so I want to take you back to the moment when you're looking at the first slide. Let's go back to that for a second. Okay. So you're taking a quiz. And you're having those thoughts surrounding the first item, which will not mistaken the automatic thought we talked about this right with cognitive behavioral therapy. Go on Mac thought is that I'm, I'm not going to get this one right.",routine,141_72,T,gc,-1.0,"Toh thik hai, toh main chahta hun ki main tumhe woh lamha yaad dilao jab tum pehle slide ko dekh rage ho. Chalo uspe ek second ke liye laut jayein. Thik hai. Toh tum ek quiz le rahe ho. Aur tumhare dimaag mein woh vichaar chal rahe hain jisme pehle item ke baare mein soch rahe ho, jo ki hamare betahasha vichaar ke saath nahi hoga jiske baare mein humne bhi baat kiya tha, wah cognitive behavioral therapy ke saath hoga. Aage badho, Mac ke vichaar yeh hai ki main yeh sahi nahi kar paunga."
73,Yeah,inactive,141_73,P,gc,0.0,Haan
74,or something to that effect ?,routine,141_74,T,crq,0.0,ya usko keval namm ka prabhav hai ya kuchh aur?
75,right.,inactive,141_75,P,id,0.0,Thik hai
76,What does that mean to you?,routine,141_76,T,irq,0.0,Tumhare liye ye kya arth rakhta hai?
77,"It means once I don't get that, right, I'm not Getting in anything else, right, okay",symp/reasoning,141_77,P,id,-1.0,"Yeh matlab hai, ki jab tak mai usko nahi samajhta, theek hai, mai kisi aur cheez mein nahi pad raha hu, theek hai, thik hai"
78,"Alright So with that thought means to you is that you're going to miss that item and then you're going to miss all the rest of it. So you're, you're going to fail the whole quick whole thing. ",routine,141_78,T,gc,0.0,"Thik hai, toh uss khayaal se matlab hai ki tum uss cheez ko chhod denge aur fir uske baaki sab bhi chhod denge. Isse tum poora kaam jald hi poorna nahin kar paoge."
79,Yeah.,inactive,141_79,P,cd,-1.0,Haan.
80,"So looking at that, almost, let's call that an intermediate belief, right? It's more of a rule or an expectation, right? What does that mean to you?",routine,141_80,T,gc,0.0,"Dekhte huye dekhne par lagta hai ki, lagbhag, chalo use ek madhyamik vishwas kehte hain, sahi? Yeh zyada ek kanoon ya ek ummid se kam hai, sahi? Tumhe iska kya matlab hai?"
81,"It just gets worse. If I fail the quiz, then I'm like, Oh my god, I'm gonna fail the panel, I am going to fail the course and that's gonna affect my GPA.",symp/reasoning,141_81,P,cd,-2.0,"Yeh toh ghatiya ho raha hai. Agar main quiz nahi paas hua, toh main waise hi ho jaunga, yaar, Oh my god, main panel bhi nahi paas karunga, main course bhi nahi paas karunga aur meri GPA pe bhi asar padega."
82,So just keep stacking other other beliefs. So you're gonna fail the course. And we're gonna fail the final rather than then the course. So a few failed the course. What does that mean to you ?,routine,141_82,T,gc,0.0,"Toh bas, baaki sare beliefs ko stack karte raho. Toh aap course fail karoge. Aur hum final fail karenge, course ki bajaye. Toh kuch logon ko course fail ho gaya. Tumhe iska kya matlab hai?"

84,You're not going to graduate ?,inactive,141_84,T,crq,0.0,Tum graduation nahi karoge?
85,Yeah.,inactive,141_85,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
86,"So we've moved from failing the quiz if we just look at the meaning, right? To fail on the final to fail on the course, and now to not graduating. So if you didn't graduate, what would that mean to you?",routine,141_86,T,irq,0.0,"Toh humne koshish ki thi ki sirf arth dekh kar hum quiz mein fail nahi ho, sahi? Par ab agar hum final exam mein fail ho ya course mein fail ho, toh ab toh graduation bhi nahi hogi. Toh agar tumne graduation nahi kiya, toh tumhe yeh kya maayne rakhta hai?"
87,I can't I can't be a teacher. I can't do what I want to do.,symp/reasoning,141_87,P,cd,-2.0,"Mai nahi ho sakti, mai ek teacher nahi ho sakti. Mai woh nahi kar sakti jo mai karna chahti hun."

89,Right.,inactive,141_89,P,cd,0.0,Sahi hai
90,"Right. So we go a step further and say, What would it mean to you if you couldn't be a teacher?",routine,141_90,T,irq,0.0,"Sahi hai. Toh hum ek kadam aur aage jaate hain aur kehte hain, Agar tum teacher nahi ban sakte toh tumhare liye yeh kya matlab hoga?"
91,I don't know who I'd be at that point. That's what I always saw as my career. So I don't know what my future would look like at that point. Without that.,symp/reasoning,141_91,P,id,-2.0,Mujhe nahi pata ki us samay main kaun honga. Ye wahi hai jo main hamesha se apni career ki nazar mein dekha. Iss liye main nahi jaanta ki us samay meri aane waali zindagi kaisi hogi. Uske bina.
92,"So if you were to phrase it, and kind of think back as we to the CBT techniques and the kind of conceptualization uncovered. If you're to phrase as an if statement. What would you? What would you be if you couldn't be a teacher? what that make you?",routine,141_92,T,id,0.0,Toh agar aap yeh sentence apnaaye aur ek baar poorvavarti CBT techniques aur khulaasa ki oor yaad karein. Agar aap isey ek sentence ke roop mein samjhein toh kya hoga? Agar aap ek if statement ke roop mein samjhein toh aap kya honge? Agar aap ek teacher nahi ho sakte toh aap kya honge? Usse aap kaisa mehsoos karenge?
93,I am a person who didn't make it. I'm a person that failed. Like we said earlier.,symp/reasoning,141_93,P,id,-1.0,Main ek aadmi hun jo usse nahi bana. Main woh aadmi hun jo asafal hua. Jaise humne pehle kaha tha.
