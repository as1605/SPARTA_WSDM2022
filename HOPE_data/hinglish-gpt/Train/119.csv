4,"I saw you last time a week ago. And I know you've had some concerns with employment working on employment. The first before we get into that I wanted to check in and see how you're doing emotionally. I know from last week, on a scale of one to 10 you said you were suffering from depression at about seven. Yeah. How is it today?",symp/reasoning,119_4,T,id,,"Maine tumhe pehli baar hafte pehle dekha tha. Aur mujhe pata hai ki tumhe rozgaar se kuch chinta hai. Sabse pehle hum us par baat karne se pehle, main tumhara haalchaal aur bhavnatamkta kaise hai uske baare me check karna chahta tha. Pichle hafte se mujhe pata hai ki tumne kaha tha ki, ek se das tak ke antaral me tum depression ka shikaar ho. Haan. Aaj kaisa hai?"
5,"It's been it's been up and down. I think today, it's probably a seven again. But you know, I've been back down to a nine lately. I guess maybe I feel a little better because I'm coming here. And I know, we'll get to talk about it a little bit. But I guess you know, last time we were talking about me trying to get a job and live full time job. And I think I just realized last week that it's really hard for me to work full time right now. You know, I'm doing the part time thing with the work program, and they want us to do volunteer work in the afternoon, if we haven't found a full time job by a certain week. And I just, you know, just thinking about it, and I just don't think I can do that. I just don't think I can work for eight hours every day. It's just too much.",story,119_5,P,id,-2.0,"ये तो अपने ऊपर और नीचे हो गया है। मुझे लगता है, आज यह फिर से सात हो सकता है। लेकिन आपको तो पता है, मैं पिछले कुछ समय से नौ पर हुआ हूँ। मुझे शायद इसलिए थोड़ा अच्छा लग रहा हो,क्योंकि मैं यहां आ रहा हूँ। और मुझे पता है, हम उसके बारे में थोड़ी बात करेंगे। लेकिन मुझे लगता है, आप जानते हैं, हम आपसे बात कर रहे थे कि मैं नौकरी पकड़ने की कोशिश कर रहा हूँ और पूरे समय की नौकरी करने की कोशिश कर रहा हूँ। और मुझे पिछले सप्ताह पता चला कि अभी मेरे लिए पूरे समय काम करना बहुत मुश्किल है। आप जानते हैं, मैं काम काम के साथ कुछ काम कर रहा हूँ, और वे चाहते हैं कि अगर हमें नौ पुस्तक नहीं मिले हैं, तो दोपहर में स्वयंसेवक काम करना पड़ता है। और मैं बस, उसके बारे में सोच रहा था, और मुझे लगता है, मैं यह नहीं कर सकता। मेरे लिए रोजाना आठ घंटे काम करना ब"
6,"So you're having some concerns about full time work and that level of energy, you'd have to exert that commitment. Alright, so we'll be okay today, if we kind of structured, what we're going to do sure for for this session. So, if it's okay with you, I'd like to talk about that. Okay. All right and and get some more details about kind of what's going on this week and your feelings surrounding that. And we touched on this a little bit in the last session. But I'd like to talk about kind of your core beliefs, your central beliefs that might be contributing some of these feelings of depression. Yeah. And then, for the last part, we'll work on like we did before, interventions to try to help you with with what's going on at work and with your depressed mood. And we can make changes to this as needed. I just want to start with an outline that we can, we can have going in okay. So make sense. Okay. Anything you want to add or take away from that?",routine,119_6,T,id,,"So you are worried about doing a regular job and the energy it requires. Alright, let's be okay today, if we make a plan for this session. So, if it's alright with you, I want to discuss that. Okay. Alright, and get more details about what's happening this week and how you feel about it. We talked about it a little bit in the last session. But I want to talk about your main beliefs, the beliefs that may be causing your depression. Yeah. And then, for the last part, we'll use strategies like we did before, to help you with your work and depressed mood. We can change this based on your needs. I just want to start with a plan that we can stick to, okay? Does that make sense? Anything you want to add or remove from that?"
7,"No, I mean, that makes sense.",inactive,119_7,P,on,,"Nahi, main matlab yehi hai, woh toh samajh mein aata hai."
8,"Okay. So, tell me a little bit more about what's going on with the work.",inactive,119_8,T,irq,,Okay. Ab toh batao mujhe thoda sa zyada kaam ke baare me kya ho raha hai.
9,"Well, I mean, I don't really know why it is. I know I'm always tired because I just I have so much trouble sleeping, as I told you before. It's just It doesn't matter how tired I am, I can't sleep, but it's just I go, I go in the morning, you know, eight to noon, but then in the afternoon, it's just like, it's so hard to keep going on. It's just such a long amount of time. And I just feel like, I don't know if I can really do it. And especially in the winter, you know, if you work eight hours, by the time you get out of work, it's dark out and it just makes my depression so much worse.",symp/reasoning,119_9,P,id,-2.0,"Arey, main soch raha tha, ki yaar mujhe pata hi nahi kyun hai. Pata hai main hamesha thaka hua rehta hu kyunki mujhe neend nahi aati, maine pehle bhi bataya tha. Lekin kya pata, kitna thaka hua rehta hu, phir bhi neend nahi aati. Lekin subah jaake main jaata hu, aath se dopahar tak, lekin phir dopahar mein, itna mushkil ho jaata hai, fir bhi jaana padta hai. Kitna lamba eight ghante ka kaam hai. Aur mujhe aisa lagta hai, ki main ye kar saku ya nahi. Aur especially jab sardi ka mausam hota hai, toh aath ghante kaam karke, kaam se nikalte hi raat ho jaati hai aur isse mera depression aur bhi badh jaata hai."
10,"So, the latter part of the day is more of a struggle for you.",symp/reasoning,119_10,T,crq,,"So, din ke aakhiri hisse mein zyada se zyada koshish karne ki zaroorat hai."
11,"
 Yeah, a lot of hard work day.",inactive,119_11,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan, bahut saara hard work hai roz."
12,So getting up in the morning and getting to work on time. You do okay with that.,symp/reasoning,119_12,T,irq,,Subah subah uthkar kaam pe samay par pahuchna. Tu usse thik kar leta hai?
13,"It's hard. It's hard, but I feel like I'm better at that. I'm better at it. I'm already up anyway. So, you know, I know I gotta get up. I gotta do what I have to do.",symp/reasoning,119_13,P,id,-1.0,"Ye mushkil hai. Ye mushkil hai, lekin mujhe lagta hai ke main usme behtar hoon. Main usme behtar hoon. Main toh abhi bhi uth gaya hoon. Toh, pata hai na, mujhe pata hai main uthna hoga. Mujhe jo bhi karna hai karne hoga."
14,"So the work program you're in now, you work in the morning?",routine,119_14,T,yq,,"To ab tum us work program mein ho, to subah kaam karte ho kya?"
15,Yeah.,inactive,119_15,P,op,,Haan.
16,What hours are you there?,inactive,119_16,T,irq,,Tum kaunse ghante tak ho?
17,Eight to noon.,inactive,119_17,P,id,,Aath se dupahar tak.
18,And there's some work you have to do in the afternoon.,routine,119_18,T,irq,,Aur afternoon me kuch kaam hai jo tumhe karna padega.
19,"Well, yeah, since I've been there for what is it eight weeks. And I haven't found a job yet. They want us to volunteer in the afternoon and they find us our own place of volunteer. So that's good. I don't have to find that myself. But I guess they want to get you used to doing something for eight hours a day and maybe you have something to put on your resume. And guess what? have like a big gap in your resume that doesn't look good either. So haven't been able to say a work tear even though I didn't make money. But just thinking about it, it's so exhausting. And you know, I get out of the work program and I think if I did go to, I can barely make it home. It's just so all I want to do is go home.",symp/reasoning,119_19,P,id,-1.0,"Haan, haan, main wahi 8 hafte tak raha hun, aur ab tak mujhe koi naukri nahi mili hai. Wo humse kya chahte hain ke hum aadhe din volunteer kare aur humein volunteer ke liye khud se jagah dhunde. Toh wo toh achcha hai. Mera khud dhundhne ki zaroorat nahi hai. Par mujhe lagta hai wo tumhe aadhe din kaam karne ke liye aadat dalwana chahte hain, aur shayad tumhe resume mein kuch likhne ke liye bhi. Aur kya? Agar tumhare resume mein bada gap hoga toh wo bhi achcha nahi lagega. Toh ab tak kaam toh nahi kar saka, bas sochta hun ki kitna thaka dena hai. Aur pata hai, jab main work program se bahar nikalta hun, to pahuchaana bhi muskil ho jata hai. Bas ghar jaane ka mann karta hai."
20,Thinking about it's exhausting. Can you tell me what type of thoughts you're having?,symp/reasoning,119_20,T,id,,"Sochna

Sochna yeh bahaut takaan deti hai. Kya aap mujhe bata sakte hain ki aapke dimaag mein kaun se khayal aa rahe hain?"
21,"I just don't think I can do it. Like, I just don't think I'm the kind of person that can work eight hours a day. And it just makes me feel like what's the point like, I'm going to work eight hours a day.",symp/reasoning,119_21,P,id,-1.0,"Mujhe lagta hai main yeh nahi kar sakti. Jaise, mujhe lagta hai main woh tarah ka insaan nahi hoon jo 8 ghante roz kaam kar sakta hai. Aur yeh mujhe aisa mehsoos karvata hai jaise kya matlab hai, main 8 ghante roz kaam karungi?"
22,I don't think I can just there's just too many hours.,inactive,119_22,T,id,,मैं नहीं लगता है कि मैं उस जगह पर सिर्फ इतने सारे
23,Yeah.,inactive,119_23,P,op,,हाँ
