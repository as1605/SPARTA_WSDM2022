0,"Well, I could see these types of decisions where you're talking about potentially breaking families up and having real consequences to families. I could see how these decisions could be. I'm sure there's guidelines you are supposed to follow that you really don't have a whole lot of choice in. But you could also really agonize and overanalyze a decision like that because the consequences are so great. Maybe somehing that could be happening.",symp/reasoning,34_0,T,id,,"Achchha, main yeh tyohar dekh sakta tha jahan tume baat kar rahe theh potenshiyal gharano ko todatay huey aur unke parinam ko real mein manwna. Main apne aaise faisle dekh sakta tha. Main yaqeen rakhata hun ki yahan par tumhe follow karney ke liye bohot kam aecha, hatta ke koi bhi choice na ho. Par tum ek aisi faisla per aazmaish aur gambheerataan bhi kar saktey ho kyonki parinam bohot bade hote hain. Ho sakta hai yeh hona ho raha ho."
1,"Yeah, I think so. I mean, you're right. To a certain extent, we have guidelines and everything like that. But I also feel like certain things, it just isn't black and white, and I have to make a judgment call. And I used to trust my judgment, but now I feel like how do I know that I'm making the right decisions?",story,34_1,P,id,-2.0,"Haan main bhi sochta hoon. Main matlab kar raha hoon ki tum sahii ho. Thodi si hain humari guidelines aur har cheez jaise. Par main ek baar bhi mehsoos karta hoon ki kuch batein khaas baatain nahin thi bina kala aur peela hote hue,aur mujhe ek faisla lena parega. Aur main pehle apne faislon pe bharosa karta tha,par ab poochta hoon kaise jaanta hoon main ki muje sahi faisla lena hai?"
2,"Yeah. Well, and this is really the one of the key parts of what may be causing this distress. We talked about this insecurity. You're on this I'm sure. And so you know, one question may be, did you make a efficient or less efficient decision with this particular family but the larger question is, you as a person can you can you do this, this job and if you do it and make money Like, what would you do then? Could you go through this again?",story,34_2,T,id,,Haan. Aur yeh hai sachmein ek key parts jo yeh distress cause kar rahe hain. Humney is insecurity ke baare mein baat ki thi. Tu is par sure ho gaya hoga. Ek sawaal ho sakta hai ki tu ne iss particular family ke liye efficient ya less efficient decision liya. Lekin baada sawaal yeh hai ki tu aadmi haan ke iss job ko kar sakta hai aur agar paise bhi bana sakta hai to phir usske baad? Kar payega yeh phir se?
3,"Yeah, I think that's where the fear is, is that if 99 times out of 100 I do it right, there's still gonna be that one that I messed up. And I'm starting to feel like that one mistake could be like, life changing for somebody.",symp/reasoning,34_3,P,id,-2.0,"Haan, main umeed karta hun ki wohi rasam hai, ki ek baar mein navi-navikar sahi karne se bhi, ek mai hi galath ho jaata hoon. Aur mujhe lag raha hai ki woh ek galti kisi ke jeevan ko badal sakti hai."
4,"And it could be you certainly in a job where, like, most jobs where mistakes have consequences. You also do a lot of good for a lot of people. So by you not being in the field. They're not getting the benefit of the skills you have.",story,34_4,T,id,,"Aur ek baar aapka aana yeh tay ho sakta hai ki aap ek aisi job mein lage accomplishing jaha mein, jaise ki, bahut saare jobs jaha galtiyan ka consequences hota hai. Aap bahut saare logon ki bhi bahut acha good karte hain. So aap ka abhi field mein nahi hone se woh logon ko aap ke skills key fayde nahi mil pa rahe."
5,"I guess that's true. Like, yeah, maybe somebody else could come and replace me but do I think that they would be better at it? I don't know. I feel like I was pretty good at it before I started. have all these doubt.",story,34_5,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta hai yeh sach hai. Jaise, haan, shayad koi aur aa kar mujhe replace kar de per main samajhta hu ki wo isse behtar kar payega? Main nahi jaanta. Mujhe lagta hai ki main isse pehle bahut achha kar raha tha. In sab doubts ke saath."
6,"So, so mostly This was good until recently. Well, alright, let's look at this from another point of view. You really seem like, you can empathize with these families. You really, to me, it seems like you really know what they're feeling.",routine,34_6,T,id,,"Aur yeh, ji bahut achha chal raha tha, ekdum thik-thak, lekin ab se kuch dino pehle. Acha, thik hai, ab hum iski doosri nazar se dekhte hain. Tumhaare paas bilkul waisa lag raha hai, ki tum in pariwaaron ke saath patjhad le sakte ho. Mujhe lag raha hai ki tum bilkul samajhte ho ki inhe kya mehsoos hota hai."
7,Yeah I care about them,routine,34_7,P,ack,1.0,Haan Main Unke Liye Parhej Karta Hu.
8,"and appreciating their perspective. Take a moment and try to walk in their shoes. If a professional like yourself came to you and your family situation and maybe you're engaged in the activities where it was warranted that your family we've broken up temporarily. What would you want? How would you want them to process that? Like you said, thinking about the caseworker from the point of view of the family? How would you want them to feel that? Would you want them to process that decision?",story,34_8,T,irq,,"Aur unke nazariye ko badhayiyon. Ek pal laga ke unke jaise khade hokar socho. Agar ek professional aapke ghar aur apke ghar ke situation mein aaya aur shayad aisa hua ki apke parivaar ko thodi der ke liye todne ka faisla kiya gaya. Tum kya chahte? Tumhe unko kaise yeh process karna chahiye? Jaise aapne kaha, us caseworker ko ghar se nazariye se dekh kar? Tumhe kaise chahye ki wo us faisla ko process kare?"
9,"I don't know. That's a hard question. I mean, if they took my kids away, even if it was the right thing, I would want them to be at least a little bit, you know, feel a little bit bad about having to make such a hard decision. But I guess if, you know, if they fell apart, every time that they made that kind of decision, they wouldn't be able to help other people.",story,34_9,P,id,,"Main nahi jaanti. Yeh ek mushkil sawaal hai. Matlab, agar woh meri bachchon ko le jaate, chahe voh sahi ho ya galat, mujhe toh chahiye ki woh thoda-thoda hi naraz hoke aise zor-zabar faisla lene ka majboor huwe. Lekin agar, jaise ki, agar woh har faisla liye hue ek doosre ki tarah tute toh unhein doosron ko madad nahe karna."
10,"So from the family's point of view, if you're in that situation, you can appreciate what the caseworker has to do. Well, you'd like to have some compassion for you. Okay, that seems reasonable. Yeah. So now flip back into the role you're in. You made the decision you had to make although you're second guessing it That's separate. Do you have compassion for them?",story,34_10,T,id,,"Aur apne parivar ka nazariya dekhte hue, agar aap iss situation me ho toh aap samajh sakte hai ki case worker ko kya karna hoga. Aur aapko uske liye kuch daya bhi ho. Sahi, vo theek lagta hai. Han. Ab phir se wohi role mein aao jis mein aap the. Aap ne jo faisla kiya vo aapka the, par ab aap ko uske khilaf bhi laga hai. Yeh alag baat hai. Toh aapko unke liye kuch daya bhi hai?"
11," Yeah, I mean, I think that might be the problem is I have too much of it. You know, I worry about how they feel, even if maybe taking the kids away was the right thing. It's just like so devastating. To lose your kids, whether you're doing the right things or not, you know, you want your kids with you. You want to be able to take care of them, even if you're not doing a really good job at it.",story,34_11,P,id,-1.0,"Ji haan, Mere matlab yeh hai ki shayad yeh problem ho, mujhe tadad mein zyada hai. Athan, main unke baare mein pareshan hoon, chahe taking away the kids sahi ho ya nahin. Yeh ek dhamm no hai ki aapke bacche aapko chod jaayein, chahe aap galat ho ya sahi ho. Tumhein chahie ki aap unko sambhal sakte ho, chahe aap us mein kamaal karne mein kamyaab nahin ho."
