So we'll like sleep over a friend's house. And, you know, we're not driving and it's mostly within our friend group. So we're not worried about strangers putting weird things in our drinks.

On the other hand, there's a little bit more, I guess. Planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can. And then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck. Your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend who drink too much. Okay, and the other not so good things about the alcohol,",story,135_78,T,ack,0.0,"Haanji. Theek hai, toh ek taraf, kuch fun cheezein jo alcohol se judi hai wo hai ki log thoda relax hote hain, sort of without any worries. Zara sa loosen up ho jao. Dusri taraf, planning thodi zyada zaruri hai, kyunki aapko ye ensure karna hai ki aap isko safely ya jab tak ho sake, safe tareeke se kar rahe hain. Fir yahan aur bhi consequences ho sakte hain, jaise ki vomiting ya agar aap nahi ho toh bhi aap stuck ho sakte hain. Aapki fun khatam ho jaati hai jab aap apne friend ke saath deal karte hain who bahut zyada peeta hai. Okay, aur phir dusri cheezein jo alcohol ke baare mein itni acchi nahi hai."

So I, you know, I want to be as safe as possible in those terms and be in a setting where like, we can let loose but still be safe, like someone's house or parents at home or something.
