0,"So you mentioned before that when you wake up in the morning, you you don't want to go to work, what's going through your mind?",symp/reasoning,134_0,T,irq,,"Tumne pahle mentioned kiya tha ki jab tum subah uthoge, to tumhe kaam par jaane ka mann nahi hota, tumhare dimaag mein kya chal raha hai?"
1,"I'm gonna have to, you know, hear what my coworkers have to say about what's going on. I might make another mistake. Who knows if I'm going to find out that something terrible happened to these kids when I go back to work? I guess a lot of stuff like that.",symp/reasoning,134_1,P,id,-2.0,"Main toh sunna padega na, mere coworkers ki baat, kya ho raha hai, yah toh mai doosri galti kar lunga. Kaun jaanta hai ki kaam par laut kar pata chalega ki in bachcho ke saath kuch bura hua hai? Main sochta hoon ki aisi bahut si cheeze ho sakti hai."
2,"So looking into one I'm going to make a mistake. That kind of connects to what we were talking about before it says the uncertainty, you're not sure of your own skills and you're afraid of an error that's going to be costly. So when you think that thought, I'm gonna make a mistake, so this is when you're, when you're in bed before you start your day, and you have that thought, what happens right then?",routine,134_2,T,id,,"Toh main dekh rahi hu ki mujhe ek galti ka honewala hai. Wo us se juda hai jo hum pehle baat kar rahe the jaha uncertainty jo hai, jab tum apne ap se doubt me hai aur tumhe dar hai ke wo galat hone par jayega. Toh jab tum wo sochti ho, main galti karungi, toh ye tab hota hai jab tum raat ko sote waqt ho aur tumhare dimaag me wo khayal aata hai, toh us waqt kya hota hai?"
3,"I feel more anxious. You know, I think about like, what could happen to somebody else if I make a mistake, like kids going to the wrong home or, you know, not being with their parents when their parents you know, we're not doing anything wrong. And I just feel really like overwhelmed and it gets hard to breathe and I just want to go back to sleep and not have to face anything.",symp/reasoning,134_3,P,id,-2.0,"Mujhe aur zyada chintit lag rahi hai. Pata hai, main sochti hoon ki agar main galti se kuchh karoon, toh kisi aur ko kya ho sakta hai, jaise bachchon ko galat ghar pahuncha diya jaaye ya phir unke ma-baap ke saath nahi hoon jab wo sahi kaam kar rahe hain. Aur phir mein bilkul overwhelmed feel karti hoon aur saans lene mein mushkil hoti hai aur bas sone jaana chahti hoon aur kuchh bhi na dekhna pade."
4,So there's emotional consequences. And then the behaviors. You don't want to get out of bed.,symp/reasoning,134_4,T,id,,"Toh, yahaan aapke emotions ke natije hai. Aur phir aapke kriyaye. Aapko bistar se nahi utarna chahte."
5,And then a lot more lately because I have trouble getting out of it.,symp/reasoning,134_5,P,id,-2.0,And baad mein bohot zyada kyunki mujhe usse bahar nikalne mein pareshaani hai.
6,"When you're staying in bed, are you under more thoughts coming up?",symp/reasoning,134_6,T,irq,,"Jab aap bedh pe rehte ho, tab kya zyaada khayaal dimaag mein aate hai?"
7,"So this is really weighing on you. And he was edified these thoughts that seem to be connected with feelings that are unpleasant, and behaviors are unpleasant, but also maybe not useful.",routine,134_7,T,id,,"Iss dost ne ekbaar to bas khaalipan ko parvaaz karane jaana hai. Aur usse ye khyaal aaye hain ki jo ehsaas se jude hain jo na-aise hain, aur karobaron bhi na-aise hain, lekin shayad upyogi bhi na ho."
8,"Yeah, they're keeping me from getting the work and stuff like that.",symp/reasoning,134_8,P,cd,,"Haan, woh mere kaam aur aise cheezon se hone se bacha rahe hain."
9,"So we have a reference point for later on as we continue counseling. I'd like to scale this problem like maybe on a scale of one to 10, where 10 represents feelings that are nearly unbearable, right? And one not really a problem. How do you feel on that scale? Where do you rate yourself right now?",routine,134_9,T,irq,,"Toh humare paas aage theek tarah se career guidance dete rahne ke liye ek reference point hai. Main is problem ko zyada se zyadangayabki tarah rank karna chahta hu, jahan par dus mein aapka ashwas bari jatihain, theek hai? Ek se dus tak ke scale par hum ye problem rank kar sakte hain, jahan dus aapkoatiansik romananchkaadar se bhara hua mehsus kar rahe hain aur ek koi problem nahi hai. Aap us scale par kaise mehsus karte hain? Aap khud ko abhi kaise rank karte hain?"
10,"Right now in this moment, probably like a five. Around the middle. Yeah, like I'm really stressed out but I not like when I'm in bed, like I can't get out of bed, that kind of thing.",symp/reasoning,134_10,P,id,-2.0,"Abhi filhaal is waqt, shayad koi five ki tarah. Kuch beech mein. Haan, jaise ki main bohot tension mein hoon lekin jab main bistar mein hota hoon, mujhe bistar se bahar nahi nikal paata, waisi."
11,How would you rate yourself when you're in bed before you go to work?,routine,134_11,T,irq,,Kya tum khud ki ranking karte ho jab tum kaam pe jaane se pehle bistar mein ho?
12,Probably like an eight.,routine,134_12,P,id,,Ho sakta hai ke approx an eight ki tarah ho.
13,"So an eight sometimes nine, right now five, so still not feeling great. Have you had to pick an emotion of standing out above the rest in anxiety, sadness, sense of dread. What would be the worst right now?",symp/reasoning,134_13,T,irq,,"So ek aath kabhi kabhi nau, ab paanch, to aaj bhi theek nahi lag raha hai. Kya tumhe kasht ye anubhav karna pada hai ki kisi ek emotion mein upar se judh kar bahar nikal sakte ho, sochne ki udaas shaq sincha aur darr. Aaj kya sabse kharab hoga?"
14,Right now probably anxiety.,symp/reasoning,134_14,P,id,-2.0,Abhi abhi shayad chintaa hai.
15,"So five, on a scale 10 inside is really standing out more",symp/reasoning,134_15,T,id,,"So paanch, 10 ke scale par andar se bahut zyada prominent hai."
