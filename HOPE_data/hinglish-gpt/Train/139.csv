112,"Okay. How important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all important, not something you're thinking about. And 10 is the most important thing, ",routine,139_112,T,irq,0.0,"Thik hai. Aapke liye apne peene mein kuch badlav karne ka kitna mahatva hai, 1 se 10 tak ki scale par, jahaan ek bilkul mahatvahin hai, aapko iske baare mein kuch sochna nahi hai. Aur 10 sabse mahatvapurna baat hai."
113,maybe five or six.,symp/reasoning,139_113,P,id,0.0,Shayad panch ya chhe sahi.
114,And why did you say five or six rather than like two or three?,routine,139_114,T,irq,0.0,Aur tumne kyun do ya teen ki jagah paanch ya cheh vargi kuch ho bataaya?
115,Because it's not something I do not care about it all but it's not something that's just constantly on my mind that I want to change about myself.,symp/reasoning,139_115,P,id,0.0,"Kyunki yeh koi cheez nahi hai jiske baare mein main bilkul hi nahin sochta, lekin yeh koi aesi chiz nahin hai jo meri zehan mein hamesha rahti hai aur main khud mein kuch badalna chahta hoon."
116,Okay. So It is something you have thought about.,inactive,139_116,T,ack,0.0,Thik hai. Toh yeh kuch hai jo tumne socha hai.
117,Yeah.,inactive,139_117,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
118,And how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale?,routine,139_118,T,irq,0.0,Aur tum kya puri suraakhya hai ki tum chaaho to usi maapdand par tabdil kar sakte ho?
119,"I'm pretty confident that I can, considering that I'm not really an alcohol user, per se. I'm not really into that whole scene, so it's gonna be difficult for me.",routine,139_119,P,id,1.0,"Mujhe kaafi bharosa hai ki main kar sakta hoon, kyunki mujhe toh alcohol ka upyog karna bilkul pasand nahi hai, haan. Mujhe usi poore scene mein interest bhi nahi hai, isliye mere liye yeh mushkil hoga."
120,So what number do you think you'd say?,routine,139_120,T,irq,0.0,Toh tum kya number bologe?
121,"On a scale of one to 10, If I can quit alchohol?",routine,139_121,P,crq,0.0,"Ek scale ke adhaar par ek se das tak, kya main sharab chhod sakta hoon?"
122,Yeah,inactive,139_122,T,cd,0.0,Haan.
123,maybe like an eight or nine.,routine,139_123,P,id,0.0,Shayad kisi atth ya nau ke barabar jaisa ho.
124,"Okay. All right. Well, kind of keeping that in mind. It sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments and you're drinking at some point.",routine,139_124,T,crq,0.0,Thik hai. All right. Aisa lagta hai ki tumhare paas kuch vagh plan hai kuch sudhaar karne ka aur tusi thoda pi rahe ho ek wak't te.
125,Yes.,inactive,139_125,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
126," And it's moderately important to you. It's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself. And you actually feel very confident that you could be successful. With it, what sort of gold Do you think might be good to set for today?",routine,139_126,T,ack,0.0,"Aur yeh tumhare liye humesha zaruri nahin hai. Yeh kuch aisa hai jo tum karna chahte ho kyunki tum apne liye bade bade lakshya rakhte ho. Aur tum yakeen sa kar ruke ho ki tum kamiyaab ho sakte ho. iske saath, aaj ke liye kya sahi hoga soojhta hai?"
127,"Um, probably to stop. Maybe next Friday I go to I have a drink at all. ",routine,139_127,P,gc,-1.0,"Um, shaayad rukna hai. Shayad agle hafte main jaunga aur pee ke aaoonga."
128,Okay. Do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely?,routine,139_128,T,yq,0.0,Theek hai. Kya tum waqt bhar poori tarah se rukne ki sakshamta rakhte ho?
129,"Yeah, I mean, I can just tell my friends, my parent, my friends aren't really that pressuring. It's just like outside people that don't really know that well. So I could just tell them, Hey, I don't feel like having a drink today.",routine,139_129,P,op,0.0,"Haan, main toh bol sakta hoon apne doston ko, apne maa baap ko, mere doston ne na kafi taakat nahi dalti hai. Ye bas bahar ke log hain jo mujhe zyada nahi jaante. Toh main bas unhe bol sakta hoon, Hey, aaj maine apne liye drink nahi leni."
130,But what might be some benefits of following through with that goal?,routine,139_130,T,orq,0.0,Lekin kya kuchh fayde ho sakte hain us lakshya ko pura karne ke?
131,"Definitely, I'll have like, all my senses there and I'll be aware of everything that's going on.",routine,139_131,P,od,0.0,"surely, main sab kuch vaha par rakhunga and main sab kuch jankari rakhunga ki jo waha ho raha hai."
132,Uh huh. Anything else?,inactive,139_132,T,orq,0.0,Uh huh. Aur kuchh?
133," Um, health concerns? I guess I know, alcohol is bad for your health. So that would be one.",routine,139_133,P,od,0.0,"Bhai, swasthya ke maamle? Mujhe lagta hai, sharab sehat ke liye kharab hai. To woh ek hoga."
134,"Okay. So it's, it sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking anymore, at least at the next party and seeing how it goes.",routine,139_134,T,gc,0.0,"Thik hai. Toh waisay toh lagta hai ki tumhe goal set karne mein kaafi aaram hai ki aage se pina bund karoge, kam se kam agli party mein, aur dekhenge ki aage kya hota hai."
135,Yeah.,inactive,139_135,P,gc,0.0,haan.
136,Okay. Do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if working out for you.,routine,139_136,T,orq,0.0,"Thik hogya to fir hum mil lein na, aise hi pata karne ke liye ki kaisa chal raha hai aur dekhein ki tumhare liye kaam kar raha hai ya nahi."
137,"Yeah, that would be okay.",inactive,139_137,P,od,0.0,"Haan, woh theek hoga."
138,"All right, great. And then it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are health benefits and having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do.",routine,139_138,T,ack,0.0,"Theek hai, bahut badiya. Aur lagta hai ki aapko kuch swasthya laabh aur aapke shiksha aur vyavsayi lakshyon ko purn karne mein aasan hona chahiye aur aapke peeche chal rahe doston ko na pareshan hona."
139,Right.,inactive,139_139,P,gc,0.0,Theek hai
140,"Okay. Well, very good. Is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know? ",inactive,139_140,T,irq,0.0,"Okay. Accha, bahut achha. Mujhe kuch aur pata hona chahiye kya tumhe?"
141,How would you advise me to like get maybe my friends to stop drinking?,symp/reasoning,139_141,P,id,0.0,Tum mujhe suggest kaise karenge ki meri friends ko sharab peena band karne ke liye?
142,"Oh, that's a great question. So a lot of times, kids who are trying to cut back it's harder if their friends are still drinking. And one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol. But of course, that's harder if you're not doing planning. So some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say, and there's already alcohol there, and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends. Some of the things that I would recommend, since you're interested Are you know, carrying around Different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it. So, you know, even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or, you know, if people are having a mixed drink, just having the coke, say without any alcohol mixed into it. Often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something. It kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there. Do you think any of those things might work for you? ",routine,139_142,T,gc,0.0,"Oh, yeh ek bahut badiya sawaal hai. Toh kaafi baar, bacho ko jo kam karne ki koshish kar rahe hai, unke liye ye muskil hota hai agar unke dost abhi bhi peete hai. Aur ek sahj tareeka ye hai ki alcohol se nahi judi aur badiya activities karne ki koshish karo. Lekin yeh toh pakka hai ki ye mushkil hoga agar tum planning nahi karoge. Toh kuch cheeze jo kaam aasakti hai agar tum party mein ho aur waha pe alcohol hai, aur waha pe aur bacche hai jo shayad tumhara sabse jyada close dost nahi hai. Toh kuch cheeze main suggest karunga, kyunki tum interested ho, kya tum samajh rahe ho, alag tarah ki drink leke jao jo alcohol wala lagta ho. Toh tum haath mein ek khali beer ki bottle ya beer ki can le liya karo ya, tumhe kuch bhi peene ki zarrurat nahi hai, sirf coke peeyo. Bahut baar yeh dekha gaya hai ki agar tumhare haath mein kuch bhi ho toh alcohol offer karne wale logon ke liye ek accha barrier ban jata hai kyunki tumhare paas already kuch hai. Ye unhe yeh rok deta hai ki wo kuch aur tumhare glass mein daale. Kya tumhe lagta hai kya inme se koi kaam aasakta hai tumhare liye?"
143,"Yeah, for sure.",inactive,139_143,P,gc,0.0,"Haan, zaroor."
144,Okay. What about in terms of talking to your friends about it? Have you thought about how you might approach with them? Or is that something else you'd like some tips about about telling them about your plan to stop drinking?,routine,139_144,T,irq,0.0,Okay. Lekin tere doston se baat karne ke hawalay se kya socha hai? Kya tumne unke saath kaise baat karna hai is bare mein socha hai? Ya kya yeh koi aur cheez hai jis ke baare mein tumhe kuch tips chahiye apne sharab peene ki yojna ke baare mein unhe batane ke liye?
145,"I was just planning on playing them that I don't really want to drink anymore. That was me. Know, ",inactive,139_145,P,id,0.0,Main to bas unhe khelne ka soch raha tha ki mujhe ab aur sharab peene ka man nahi hai. Wo main hi tha. Samjhe?
146,your friends would be pretty comfortable with that.,inactive,139_146,T,crq,0.0,Tumhare dosto ko usse bahut comfortable feel karayenge.
147,"Yeah, I mean, that was my closest friends for sure. ",inactive,139_147,P,cd,0.0,"Haan, main yehi kehna chahta hu ki woh mere sabse kareebi dost the."
148,"Okay, great. Any other concerns or questions? Anything else? I go?",inactive,139_148,T,ack,0.0,"Theek hai, bahut accha. Aur koi pareshani ya sawaal hai? Aur kuch? Main chalu?"
149," No, I think okay. ",inactive,139_149,P,gc,0.0,"Nahi, mujhe lagta hai thik hai."
150,"Okay. So then, like I said, I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going. And then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks and we can maybe problem solve together. ",inactive,139_150,T,gc,0.0,"Theek. Toh phir, jaise maine kaha, main koshish karunga aur dekhenge ki shayad hum kuchh hafte baad mil sakte hain aur dekhenge ki kya ho raha hai. Aur agar cheezein shandar ho rahi hain toh wahiyat aur agar koi rukawat aati hai toh hum saath mein samasya ka samadhan kar sakte hain."
