5,I think obviously the shaking I think my hands and legs shaking and kind of going really red and sweating and just looking great. went ahead.,symp/reasoning,57_5,P,id,,Main mere haath aur paon kaanpane ke bare mein soch raha thha aur haath aur paon kaanp rahe thhe aur bahut laal ho rahe thhe aur paseena aa raha thha aur bahut khubsurat dikhai de raha thha. Aadhe chukar ke.
6,"So it sounds like you have quite a strong mental image of how you see yourself when you're in these social situations. Yeah. You say you go read you shake. Is there anything else that you think that you do? I mean, describe yourself. How do you think you look, when you're in these situations, just",story,57_6,T,irq,,"Toh haan, lagta hai ki tumhare paas apni apni mentality sahi karne ka ek majboot tasvir hai jab tum aise samaajik paristhitiyon mein hote ho. Haan. Tum kehte ho ki tum jaate ho padhna aur tumko hilaate ho. kya tumhe kuch aur lagta hai ki tum karte ho? Mera matlab, khud ko vishleshna. Tumhe aisa kaisa lagta hai ki tum dikhte ho, jab tum aisi paristhitiyon mein ho, bas."
7,"like, I think I just looked really obviously weird and out of place and like really read and just visibly shaking and sweating and kind of not being able to communicate properly with people.",story,57_7,P,id,,Mujhe lagta hai main bohot ajeeb aur alag lage the aur main bohot dar gyi thi aur pasina aa raha tha aur main logo ke saath theek se communicate nahi kar sakti thi.
8,And is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these things to manage these problems?,routine,57_8,T,irq,,Kya tum kuch karta ho usko rokne ke liye aur in samasyao se nipatne ke liye?
9,"And I guess like when I'm holding the camera, I just grip onto it really, really tight, or kind of clench on my muscles and just find something that I can focus on. And to kind of try and make myself shake less and not goes red and stuff.",story,57_9,P,id,,"Aur mujhe lagta hai ki jab main camera pakda hoon, main uspe bahut hi tight grip karta hoon, ya fir apne muscles ko tight karke, aur bas kuchh dhoondhta hoon jispe main dhyaan kendrit kar sakoon. Aur aisa karke main khud par kaabu rakhta hoon, aur apna chehra laal hone se bachane ki koshish karta hoon."
10,So you focus on something you grip onto that Camera. Do you make eye contact with people?,routine,57_10,T,crq,,Toh tum kisi cheez par dhyaan lagao jispar tum camera grip karte ho. Kya tum logon se aankhon se milkar baat karte ho?
11,No. I just tend to just look down.,routine,57_11,P,cd,,Na. Main bas neeche dekhne ki aadat rakhta hun.
12,"Okay, so you also avoid eye contact? Is there anything else that you do to manage the sweating For example, ",routine,57_12,T,crq,,"Okay, toh kya tum bhi aankh se nazar bachate ho? Kya aur bhi koi cheez hai jo tum karte ho pasina sambhalne ke liye? Jaise ki,"

Yeah, just more layers and all black says you just can't tell.",story,57_13,P,cd,,"Main bas isi tarah se pasand karta hoon ki neeche dekhna aur saari kaali pehnna, taki koi mujhe asaani se nahi pehchaane aur kis baat ki chinta?

14,Okay,inactive,57_14,T,ack,,Thik hai
15,"What do you think would happen if you stopped doing these things? If you stopped gripping onto the camera? Or, you know, you start to make eye contact and not looking down? And what do you think would happen?",symp/reasoning,57_15,T,irq,,"Tum kya sochte ho ki agar tum ye cheezein karna band karde toh kya hoga? Agar tum camera ko pakadna chhodde? Ya phir, aap eye contact banane shuru kare aur neeche nahi dekhenge? Aur tumhe kya lagta hai ki kya hoga?"
16,"I think it would be so much worse. Yeah, I think I just would just check even more and be more anxious and look of more obviously, kind of weird and out of place.",symp/reasoning,57_16,P,id,,"मुझे लगता है कि यह और भी बुरा होगा। हाँ, मुझे लगता है कि मैं और ज्यादा जांच करूंगा और अधिक उत्सुक होकर, ज्यादा असामान्य और जगह से बाहर दिखूंगा।"
17,"And what I'm thinking now is how do you feel about if we did an experiment to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things? If we did a bit of a role play where we pretended to enact a situation at work, okay? And if we did this maybe twice and the first time, you do all the things that you normally do, okay and grip onto something, look down. And is there anything else that you do when you're in these situations, these work conversations to try and cope.",story,57_17,T,irq,,"Aur main jo soch rahi hun ab woh yeh hai ki agar hum tumhare vicharon ka jawaab dhundhne ke liye ek experiment karein jismein tumhara kya anubhav hoga agar tum yeh cheezein band kar do? Agar hum kuch role play karein jahan hum kaam par ek situation dikhate hain, thik hai? Aur agar hum isse do baar karein aur pehli baar, tum woh sab kuch karo jo tum normally karte ho, thik hai, aur kisi cheez par pakad lo, neeche dekho. Aur kya tum kuch aur bhi karte ho jab tum is tarah ki situations mein ho, ya kaam ke baare mein baat karte ho, sambhalne ki koshish karne ke liye."
18,"And I just kind of all just like fumble and like kind of just clench, whatever, whatever it is, I'm holding just really tight and just make sure I don't make any eye contact at all, just kind of get through it.",story,57_18,P,id,,"Aur main bas thoda sa confuse aur jaise fumble karke, jaise hi saamne koi cheez hui hai, maine bilkul pakad rakhi hai aur bahut tight hold karke, bas usme koi nazar na jaye, bas usko khatam karke nikal jati hu."
19,"Okay, so in the first time, I want you to do those things as much as you normally would, in fact, maybe even slightly more than you normally would. ",story,57_19,T,ci,,"Okay, toh pehli baar mei, main chahta hu ki tu woh kaam utna hi kare jitna tum generally karte ho, balki shayad thoda sa zyada bhi kar de."
20,"Okay, ",inactive,57_20,P,ack,,"Thik hai,"
21,"and then the second time, I want you to drop doing those things all together. ",story,57_21,T,ci,,"Fir bill kul, main chatti baar haan, mujhe chahiye ki tu sare kaam ban hu jaye."
22,Okay,inactive,57_22,P,ack,,Theek hai
23,does that sound okay?,routine,57_23,T,yq,,kya yeh theek lag raha hai?
24,try my best.,routine,57_24,P,ack,,Try kar do apni taraf se.
25,And do you? How would you feel about if we filmed this so you could actually see what you looked like?,routine,57_25,T,orq,,"Aur tum? Hum isse film karein, toh kya tumhe mehsoos hoga ki tum kaisi dikhte ho?"
26,Okay.,routine,57_26,P,od,,Okay.

30,Okay,routine,57_30,P,ack,,Thik ha.
31,"before we do this, then we're just going to fill out this form is because what we're doing now is an experiment. We call it behavioral experiments, see what happens when you change the way that you're behaving? ",story,57_31,T,irq,,"Hum karne se pehle, phir ham bas iss form ko bharenge kyunki jo hum ab kar rahe hai vo sirf ek anubhav hai. Hum usse vyavaharik anubhav kehte hai, jiske zariye dekhte hai ki apna vyavahar badalne se kya hota hai?"
32,Right. Okay,routine,57_32,P,ack,,Thik hai. Thik hai.
33,"so the first column says, I need to fill out an experiment to test this thought that you have, so that our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work, and who should I play if you're playing yourself in this roleplay? Who should I be?",story,57_33,T,id,,"Toh pehla column kehta hai, main ek experiment bharna hoga jo is vichar ko test karne ke liye hai jo aapke paas hai, taki hamara experiment yeh hai ki hum kaam par ek baatcheet karte hain, aur agar aap apne aap ko is roleplay mein khel rahe hain toh main kisko khelun? Main kis ke roop mein hoon?"
34,maybe like a client at work? I always have to sit down with clients before we did the shoe and kind of get to know a little bit more about what they want.,story,57_34,P,id,,"Shayad jaise kaam par ek client ki tarah? Main hamesha client ke saath baithkar baat karna hota tha, phir hum joota banane se pahle unke man mein kya chal raha hai thoda samajhte the."
35,"Okay, so would it work if I was maybe having a wedding and I was hiring? ",story,57_35,T,yq,,"Thik hai, kya yeh kaam karega agar main shaadi kar raha hu aur main karwaar le raha hu?"

I think it's obvious that I'm obviously quite anxious, but I don't think you can tell them shaking that much.",routine,57_90,P,id,,"Pakka nahi jaisa main sochti thi. Mujhe toh pata hai ki main bahut utaavali hoon, but mujhe lagta hai ki tum unhe itna kaamp kar bata nahi sakte."

Kya tumne khud ko kuch bewakoof kaha?"
97,"Not really. Yeah. Yeah, thought was gonna be a lot worse than",routine,57_97,P,id,,ठीक तो। हाँ। अच्छा सोचा था कि यह बहुत खराब होगा।
98,"actually it was. So you thought you were going to be like 90 say something that was 90% stupid. That's really quite strong. I mean, in the end did you pick up in Anything that could be maybe put that as a zero?",routine,57_98,T,irq,,"Actually, voh tha. Toh tunne socha tha ki tu 90 ke jaise hoga aur koi baat karega jo 90% bekar hogi. Woh kaafi sakht hai. Main manta hoon, end mein kya tune kuch sikha jo zero ki tarah ho sakta hai?"
99,"Maybe like, less than 10 maybe.",routine,57_99,P,id,,Shayad 10 se kam ho skta hai.

102,"thought again, you thought you were going to be like night out, like seriously visibly sweating. So what what score would you actually give it in the end?",routine,57_102,T,irq,,"Soch hi socha tha, tu lag raha tha ki tu bahar ja ke raat bitane jaisa hoga, sach mein paseene se tar tar ho raha tha. Toh bata, aakhir mein tu kitni naukri dega usko?"
103,"Maybe again, less than 10 I don't think you could tell at all.",routine,57_103,P,id,,"शायद फिर से, 10 से कम हो तो मुझे लगता है कि तुम बिलकुल नहीं बता सकते"
104,Mm hmm. You also said that you thought it was going to be twice as bad when you stop choosing your you know your normal strategies.,routine,57_104,T,od,,"Mm hmm. Tumne bhi kaha tha ki tumhe laga tha ki jab tum apne aam tareeke chunna band karoge, tab situation do guna zyada kharab hogi."

106,What did you notice watching that video?,routine,57_106,T,irq,,Kya tumne uss video ko dekh kar kuchh notice kiya?
107,It was actually probably better when I wasn't doing any of those things. I think I looked a lot more natural. And I was able to say what I was trying to say. I think it just come across more personable when I'm not kind of looking down and stuff.,symp/reasoning,57_107,P,id,,"yeh sach mein shayad behtar tha jab main koi bhi cheez nahi kar rahi thi. Mujhe lagta hai ki main bahut adhik prakritik dikhti thi. Aur main kya kehna chah rahi thi, wo keh sakti thi. Main sochti hu ki jab main neeche dekh rahi nahi hoti tab, main kafi vyaktigat pratit hoti hu."

109,summary,"The patient worries a lot when in social situtations, visibly shake, red and sweating. The patient tries to clench on their muscles and find something to focus on or look down and they prefer wearing black to be less obvious of worrying. The therapist requests the patient for a role-play of these situations to be enacted. On enacting the patient rates 90 on 100 for all her symptoms by doing those things she normally would. The patient believes they are going to do a lot worse if they don't do things they normally do to cope with their anxiety. After enacting, the patient feels much better and rates less than 30 for visibly shaking, less than they thought for going red, less than 10 for being stupid, less than 10 for visibly sweating. The patient felt much better and looked more natural after watching themselves in the video when they weren't doing any of those coping up things. ",,,,,
