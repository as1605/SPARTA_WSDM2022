15,"I don't know where to start. He and I had been together for about a year. And I got pregnant right away and we just had this baby a little while ago. And and before that I was working. And he and I, you know, we're on and off here and there, we get invites and he disappears for a while then he comes back. That's kind of what the ears look like. And I just been getting more and more confused on what to do and recently he did something really that didn't even look like him. He looked like a different person and it freaked me out and freaked the baby out. And quite honestly, it freaked him out too. He didn't he said he didn't know what happened and he felt he said he felt out of control.",story,155_15,P,id,-1.0,"Main nahi jaanta kaha shuru karu. Wo aur main lagbhag ek saal se saath the. Aur main turant garbhvati ho gayi aur abhi thodi der pehle humare paas yeh baccha hua hai. Aur pehle main kaam kar rahi thi. Aur wo aur main, pata nahi, kabhi-kabhi saath hote hain, kabhi-kabhi door, humein invite milte hain aur wo thode der ke liye ghaib ho jaate hain phir wapas aate hain. Yeh kaanoon jaise dikhte hain. Aur main aur zyada confuse ho rahi thi aur haal hi mein usne kuch aisa kiya jo bilkul ussi ko nahi lag raha tha. Wo ek alag insaan lag raha tha aur mujhe aur baby ko isse dara tha. Aur sach batau toh usse bhi dara tha. Usne kaha ki usse pata nahi kya hua aur usse lag raha tha ki uske haath se kuch nikal gaya tha."

All all of you the baby and you and him and, and was kind of scary.

Sabko, tumhe, bacche ko aur usko, sabko. Aur ye kaafi darawna tha."
17,"Mm hmm. Yeah, he came home. I was a friend come over a man friend, he doesn't like me to have men friends came over to help me with my resume, because I'm starting to think about going back to work. And he had a weird look in his eye and so I kind of, you know, we sped up and I kind of let my friend leave but soon as after right after he left he he kind of just got this dark, scary look and he pushed me onto the ground and and it was just different than anything that ever happened to me or us together and He just got this weird kind of like he was possessed by something. And he said he didn't, he would never do that again. He's he's really good daddy. And he really helps us out a lot.",story,155_17,P,cd,0.0,"Haan, wo ghar aaya. Mujhe ek dost aadmi, mere man ka dost, mere resume mein madad karne ke liye, mere pass aane ki ijazat nahi deta tha, kyunki main kaam par wapis jaa rahi hoon. Aur uske aankhon mein ek ajeeb si nazar thi, to maine thodi jaldi ki aur apne dost ko jaane diya lekin jaise hi wo chala gaya, wo ek andhere, daraavne nazar se dekhne laga aur mujhe zor se dhakka dekar zameen par giraya. Ye kuch aisa tha jo kabhi mere saath ya humare beech kabhi nahi hua tha aur wo ek ajeeb tarah se, jaise kisi perjali mein aa gaya tha. Aur usne kaha ki wo aisa kabhi nahi karega. Wo ek bahut acche daddy hai. Aur wo humari madad bahut karte hain."
18,"So in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand, He's really good. Good with you and good with the Father. I mean, good with your child. And on the other hand, it was just like, what is this something really different?",routine,155_18,T,gc,0.0,"Aise toh vaise yeh aapko aur unko dono ko samanjh aaye hi nahi. Kya pata ki yeh aapke bacche ke liye accha ho ya na ho. Lekin wahi saath mein wo bohut ache hai. Ache aapke saath aur ache pita ke saath. Yaani ki, aapke bacche ke liye achhe hai. Aur doosri taraf, bas aise hi, kuch alag cheez hai ya kya hai yeh?"
19,"Yeah. Yeah. And he's, he's, he really helps us out. And I didn't know what to do with that. So that's why it's, I guess that feeling that I have had since that happened has prompted me to call somebody to figure out what to do.",symp/reasoning,155_19,P,id,0.0,"Haan. Haan. Aur woh, woh, woh sach mein hamari madad karte hain. Aur mujhe uske saath kya karna hai yeh pata nahi tha. Isiliye mujhe woh ehsaas hai jisse uss baat ke baad se mere andar aaya hai, ki maine kisi ko phone karne se pehle kisi se poochna chahiye ki mujhe kya karna chahiye."
20,"What are your thoughts right now about some of the options out there for you to do if, if anything, what are what are you thinking about? ",routine,155_20,T,irq,0.0,"Right now kya hai aapke khayal kuch options ke baare mein jo aap kar sakte hain, agar kuchh bhi to kya aap kya soch rahe hain?"

23,"Yeah. Yeah, I haven't my parents live pretty far away and, and I guess he's kind of a boyfriend kind ofI guess the words jealous. He just really cares about us. And so I haven't had a chance to really talk to people about what some ideas would be that will. What could I do, I used to work and I was kind of looking forward to working again. He's he's sort of made it clear that I don't need to work because he's going to take care of us he brings home diapers and gives us some money when he's around and so we really don't need it most the time.",symp/reasoning,155_23,P,cd,0.0,"Haan. Haan, mujhe mere ma-papa bahut door rehte hain aur, aur main apni boyfriend se thoda dur rehti hu. Shayad vo mujhe us ladki se jalan ho rahi hai. Par usse humme bahut fikr hai. Aur isliye main abhi tak kisi se baat nahi kar payi ki hum kya kar sakte hain. Main pehle kaam karti thi jo mujhe bahut pasand tha, aur main fir se kaam karne ka intezaar kar rahi thi. Par use yeh ahsaas dilaya hai ki mujhe kaam karne ki zarurat nahi hai kyuki vo hamein dekhbaal karega. Vo ghar pe daipers leke aata hai aur jab vo ghar pe hota hai toh humein paise bhi deta hai, isliye humein zyada zarurat nahi hai kaam karne ki."
24,"So you had been kind of thinking about maybe going back to work and doing doing some of that on your on your own and, and yet He, he doesn't really he's expressing that he liked to be able to take care of you. And, and when he's there, he does take care of you. ",routine,155_24,T,crq,0.0,"Toh tu soch raha tha ki shayad kaam pe lautne ka aur kuch kaam apne aap karein, aur phir bhi woh woh hai jo express kar raha hai ki usse tumhari dekhbhal karne ka bohot dil chahta hai. Aur jab woh waha hota hai, woh tumhari dekhbhal karta hai."
25,"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it does take care of us. He's, uh, he's he makes sure that I have enough money for, you know, the basic needs in the house and he pays the rent and, and you know, but when I when he's gone and I run out of money, it just kind of that's when I think cut it. Just wish I could take a little bit by myself. I just not sure how to go about doing that.",story,155_25,P,cd,0.0,"Haan, haan. Haan, wo hamari dekhbhaal karta hai. Wo, uh, wo yeh dekhta hai ki mere paas ghar ke mool jarooriyaton ke liye kaafi paisa ho, aur wo kiraye ka bhi bhugtaan karta hai, aur jaante ho, jab wo nahi hai aur mere paas paisa khatam ho jata hai, tab main sochti hoon ki yeh sab kat jaaye. Bas main chahati hoon ki main khud thoda sa le saku. Mujhe bas yeh nahi samajh aa raha ki uske liye kaise kaam shuru karoon."

I try to call him sometimes and make up you know, and say sorry for the fight that we had and sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't.",symp/reasoning,155_27,P,id,-1.0,"Aur mai, aur mujhe nahi pata kon se baat karu uske bare me. Kabhi-kabhi mai usse call karne ki koshish karta hu aur tumhe mana leta hu, aur ladai ke liye maafi maangne ki koshish karta hu aur kabhi ye kaam karta hai aur kabhi nahi."

There are lots of different things that we can talk about that are that that many women in very similar situations find themselves and things that we can talk about and focus our conversation on that might help you just sort of sort out and Figure out what if anything that you want to do differently or how to what your next step might be?,routine,155_32,T,gc,0.0,Haan mujhe pata hai.

I feel like I've just been hoping and wishing and it seems like all my focus is always so when the baby's crying and I'm worrying about him and and and so the baby crying is just it's hard, but but if just now talking about it letting go of worrying about it feels kind of freeing that I could actually think about why the baby's crying as opposed to why why is he not returning my calls? or Why did he give me that look, when I you know, talked about getting a job and things like that it's not so interesting.
