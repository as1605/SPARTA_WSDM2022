54,summary,"The patient needs to make weekly presentation to about 10 people, and it makes them really nervous and they sweat all over. The presentation is about five to 10 minutes. The patient starts feeling nervous from the day before they have to present, throughout the day. They don't sleep well that night and on the day of presentation they are really terrified, drenched in sweat and breathing faster. The patient had terrible time making presentations in high school and college too. The patient has ran out of meeting room once. In another instance when they felt like running out, the patient's coworkers and their manager got into an intense fight and the patient started feeling fine again. Making these presentation every week terrifies the patient, and they don't wish their boss to regret putting them into this work. The patient has started to drink a bit to cope with this. They feel miserable. The therapist assures to set the patient with a counselor in a couple of days. ",,,,,
