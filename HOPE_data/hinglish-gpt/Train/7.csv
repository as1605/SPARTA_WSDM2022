0,Hi How are you doing today?,inactive,7_0,T,gt,,Hi Aap kese ho aaj?
1,"I'm good. But um, there has been visual, you know, we will work out like my motivation. Sure. Kind of, it's kind of related to that. Um, so I'm in school. And every few weeks we have like papers to write. And I know I know what I know I can do it. It's just actually sitting down and doing it",symp/reasoning,7_1,P,gt,,"Main thik hoon. Lekin um, waha visual ka prashna tha, tumhe pata hai, hum meri motivation ke sath kaam karenge. Pakka. Thodi si, wo usse se juda hai. Um, toh main school mein hoon. Aur har kuch hafte baad humein likhne waale kagaz hote hain. Aur main jaanta hoon main kar sakta hoon. Bas baithke karne ki zarurat hai."
2,ok will tell me about the papers.,symp/reasoning,7_2,T,irq,,"Ok, mujhe papers ke baare mein batao."
3,"Well, they're usually about five pages long. And I just, I just look at it and like, it's five pages. But I'm like, okay, so I go sit down. You know, on my computer. I'm like, Alright, I'm starting references. So I get, I start off good. I do the references. But then it's like, I get sidetracked. tracked so easily. And then I end up killing like two hours, checking the news checking and then it goes to my phone and then just looking at recipes and then it gets really off topic and then I realized I haven't done anything.",symp/reasoning,7_3,P,id,,"These days, voh paanch pages ke nearly hi hote hai. Aur main, main vaiseshe hi dekhti hu aur sochti hun, yeh to paanch pages hai. Lekin main sochti hun, theek hai, to main baith jaati hun. Apne computer par. Main sochti hun, thik hai, ab main references shuru kar deti hun. To main shuru karti hun achche se. Lekin phir bhi hota hai ki main distract ho jaati hun bahut aasani se. Aur phir pata nahi kaise do ghante beete jaate hain, news check karte hue aur phir phone par ghoomte hue, phir recipes dekhti hun, aur phir topic se bilkul alag ho jaati hun aur tab mujhe yaad aata hai ki maine kuch nahi kiya hai."
4,"Alright, so you, you have a five page paper, you sit down to work on it. You have the references, you get that part taken care of that then sounds like you kind of wander off a little bit. ",symp/reasoning,7_4,T,crq,,"Thik hai, toh tum log, tumhare paas paanch panno ka kagaz hai, tum baithke uspe kaam karte ho. Tumhare paas sandarbh bhi hai, tum use dekhlete ho, phir uska dhyaan rakhte ho, phir lagta hai ki tum thoda idhar-udhar bhaag jate ho."
5,"Oh, big time. ",inactive,7_5,P,cd,,"Oh, bahut bada time tha."
6,Yeah. Okay. And then what happens after you are done wandering a little bit?,routine,7_6,T,crq,,Haan. Theek hai. Aur phir kya hota hai jab tum thoda sa ghoom khatam kar dete ho?
7,"I get kind of annoyed with it. And then I'm like, Well, you know, I've already you know, it's already 90 time I'll try to do it tomorrow. And then, you know, either tomorrow doesn't happen or the same thing happens. And it's just and then I end up rushing right at the edge of, you know, that's due tomorrow and getting all these five pages done. It's really hard for me",story,7_7,P,cd,,"Mujhe thoda gussa aata hai usse. Fir main sochti hu, Achcha, thik hai, maine jaisa ki aap jaante hain, maine pehle hi kiya tha, waise main kal try karungi. Fir kal, ya toh kal ho hi nahi paata hai ya wahi baat hoti hai. Aur fir main jab fail karti hu, tab mujhe bhaagte huye 5 pages kal ki deadline par complete karne mein bahut mushkil ho jaate hain. Yeh mere liye bohot mushkil hai"
8,So you are you're finishing assignment on time. So the promise of lateness,symp/reasoning,7_8,T,crq,,Tum to samay par apna assignment khatam kar rahe ho. Iska matlab hai ki tum der se pahunchne ka vaada hun.
9,"No, I, I get it done. ",symp/reasoning,7_9,P,cd,,"Nahi, mai, mai karva diya."
10,You get done?,symp/reasoning,7_10,T,crq,,Tum kya ho gaye?
11,It's just all at the last minute.,symp/reasoning,7_11,P,cd,,Yeh bas sab last minute pe hai.
12,So it's really the how the time breaks out isn't working out well for you.,symp/reasoning,7_12,T,crq,,"""So it's really the how the time breaks out, isn't working out well for you."""
13,Yeah.,inactive,7_13,P,cd,,Haan.
14,You'd rather not be doing it at the last moment.,symp/reasoning,7_14,T,orq,,Tum abhi aakhiri pal mein karne se acchaa maanogey nahi.
15,"No, I mean, I try not to. I mean, I set time aside to go sit down. I'm like, Alright, you know, we're gonna start on this paper. Then sidetracked. I'm watching TV. I'm on my phone. I'm on some other website.",story,7_15,P,od,,"Nahi, main, mujhe nahi chahiye. Main, thoda samay nikal kar baithne ki koshish karta hoon. Main aisa karta hoon, thik hai, tum jaante ho, ham is kagaz par shuru karenge. Phir beechedhaar hua. Main TV dekh raha hoon. Main apne phone pe hoon. Main kisi aur website par hoon."
16,"So these so these activities that you're engaging in between when you start the work and before you start writing, also regarding the references before you start writing. You said check an email. ",story,7_16,T,crq,,"So in the activities jo tum work shuru karne se pehle aur writing shuru karne se pehle karte ho, usme tere ke maalik ho, tab bhi tumhare ke maalik se pahle references ke baare mein bhi sochte ho. Tune kaha ki email check karna hai."
17,Yeah.,story,7_17,P,cd,,Haan.
18,And other kind of sounds like unplanned small activities.,symp/reasoning,7_18,T,crq,,Aur dusre tarah ki activities waise hi ek choti si aniyamit gatividhi ki tarah lagti hai.
19,"Yeah. I mean, there's small things that keep My attention but it's not where my attention needs to go.",symp/reasoning,7_19,P,cd,,"Haan. Maine maana, kuch chote-chote cheezein hain jo mera dhyaan rakhte hain, par yeh meri dhyaan ki zaroorat waali jagah nahin hai."
20,These aren't particularly engaging activities like something you need to do. No at that moment.,story,7_20,T,crq,,"Ye khaas tarah se dilchasp gatividhiyaan nahi hai, kuch aisa jaise tumhe karna zaruri ho. Nahi, uss pal par."
21,"No I mean, I look up you know, right I started one reference and then who this article looks cool who this article you know next thing I'm know I'm researching octopuses or something.",story,7_21,P,cd,,"Nahi, main yeh keh raha tha, main tere liye search karta hoon, sahi hai maine ek reference shuru kiya aur phir iss article ko dekha aur mujhe lagta hai yeh article achha hai, phir ek doosra article dekha toh pata chala ki ab main octopuses par research kar raha hoon."
22,"So like distracted,",inactive,7_22,T,orq,,"Toh aise hi distracted ho gaye,"
23,yeah distracted like at work.,symp/reasoning,7_23,P,od,,"Yeah, kaam mein distracted jaise hoon."
24,And then there's a moment you kind of catch yourself and realize you haven't really started writing.,story,7_24,T,crq,,Aur phir ek pal hota hai jab aap khud ko pakadte hai aur smajhte hai ki aapne asal mein likhna shuru hi nahi kiya hai.
25,"Yeah, but it's like two hours late",symp/reasoning,7_25,P,cd,,"Haan, lekin ye do ghante der se hai."
26,"is too late. Yeah, so you're consuming time there. Alright. So you have a few different levels of activity. Here you have the paper, which it sounds like you're okay writing but you're you're maybe not highly motivated to write. ",symp/reasoning,7_26,T,crq,,"Abhi bohot der ho gai hai. Haan, toh wohaan pe tum samay consume kar rahe ho. Thik hai. Tumhare paas kuch alag levels ka activity hai. Yahaan pe tumhare paas paper hai, jiska shayad tum likhna theek ho par tum bohot motivated nahi ho usse likhne ke liye."
27,"Okay, ",inactive,7_27,P,cd,,"Thik hai,"
28,but you seem to be getting the references done. Okay.,symp/reasoning,7_28,T,crq,,Par tum references kar rahe ho. Theek hai.
29,"Yeah, I mean, I get some references done. Okay.",symp/reasoning,7_29,P,cd,,"Haan, main toh kuchh references karwata hoon. Thik hai."
30,"You collect the material, and then the writing part. That's the difficult part. And then you have these behaviors. In the middle, which you enjoy doing a little, but they're not something that",story,7_30,T,crq,,"Tum material collect karte ho, phir likhne ka hissa. Yeh vo mushkil hissa hai. Aur phir tumhare paas ye behaviours hote hain. Beech me, jinme se tum thoda maza lete ho, par voh kuch aisa nahi hai ki tum unka anand utha pao."
31,"I mean, they're not something I'm like am jumping for joy about it's just something to to procrastinate. So I don't have to do my paper. And I don't think that I you know, I'm not like, Oh, I need to check my email so I don't have to do my paper. It's just, Oh, I should check my email. Oh, I should check my phone. Oh, I haven't done this one Oh, I haven't seen this in a while.",story,7_31,P,cd,,"Main toh matlab kar raha tha, woh mujhe itna khushi ke liye tayaar nahi kar rahe. Bas thoda sa maujhe karne ke liye hi hai. Iss se mujhe mera paper nahi karna padega. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki main, tumhe milna nahi hai, oh, mujhe apna email check karna hai taaki mera paper na karna pade. Bas, oh, mujhe mera email check karna hai. Oh, mujhe apna phone check karna hai. Oh, maine yeh nahi kiya hai. Oh, maine yeh bahut time se nahi dekha hai."
32,But these behaviors still fulfill purpose they they do delay the writing of the paper.,story,7_32,T,crq,,Parantu yeh charitra abhi bhi uddeshya ka poora karte hain kyonki yeh kagaz ka likhne ki vilamb se rok dete hain.
33,"Yeah, that's true. ",inactive,7_33,P,cd,,"Haan, woh sahi hai."
34,"You may not be fully aware of that in a moment. But then you kind of become aware of that later that that's the purpose that those behaviors accomplished was that they kept you distracted from writing. Alright. So the the writing of papers and activity, that's a behavior that's something you're not really looking forward to. What's the behavior That was an activity that you really do look forward to, you know, think about and some level of engagement is there.",story,7_34,T,crq,,"Tu shayad bilkul aware nahi ho us baat ka ek pal mein. Par phir bad mein tu us baat ka aware ho jaati hai ke wo wo kaam te karan hai ki tu likhne se distract ho jaata hai. Theek hai. To wo papers likhna aur activity, wo ek aisa kaam hai jo tu real mein enjoy nahi karta. To wo kaun sa kaam hai? Wo ek activity hai jo tu sach mein enjoy karta hai, tu sochta hai aur engagement bhi hota hai."
35,"Well, there is this new TV show out that they just started a new season. And I have it all recorded, like 24 episodes. But I can't find time to watch it. But I'm really, you know, I've seen the first season I'm so interested in it. And I'm can't wait to see the next one. I guess that that would that's, I guess what makes me really happy right now.",story,7_35,P,cd,,"अच्छा है, उसी नए टीवी शो के बारे में जो उन्होंने एक नया सीजन शुरू किया है। और मेरे पास उसके सारे एपिसोड लेकिन मैं इसे देखने के लिए समय नहीं निकाल पा रहा हूं। पर मुझे बहुत रुचि है क्योंकि मैंने पहला सीजन देखा है। और मुझे अगला देखने का बेसब्री से इंतजार है। शायद यही चीज है जो मुझे अभी बहुत खुश करती है।"
36,So so you're excited about this television show and you how you have the episodes already recorded. And maybe one of the reasons you can't find the time is because the time you're using between the two parts of writing this paper.,story,7_36,T,crq,,Toh tum is television show se excited ho aur tumhe episodes already recorded hain. Aur shayad ek wajah hai ki tumhey time nahi mil pa raha hai kyunki tum is paper ki writing ke do parts ke beech mein time istemal kar rahe ho.
37,"Yeah. I mean, this paper is taking me a lot longer than it should.",story,7_37,P,cd,,"Haan. Mera matlab hai, yeh paper mujhe hona chahiye se kahin zyada samay le raha hai."
38,"Right. So let's let's try this. When you when you do write to paper, you're really writing it. The writing part, not the preparing part, but the writing part kind of all at the end. Right, getting it done this the night before it's due. All right. So I want to try a couple different behavioral strategies here. Okay. And these might be similar to what we tried before working with motivation. One is I think that it might be helpful and I want you let me know if I'm right here to break if it's a five page paper to break it up into more than one night. Because right now, functionally, at least a lot of what you're doing on the last night, okay. would be a more comfortable pace like Like, for example, how long does it take you to write one page?",symp/reasoning,7_38,T,orq,,"Theek hai. Toh chalo yeh try karte hain. Jab tum kagaz par likhte ho, tum sach mein likh rahe ho. Likhaayi ka hissa, taiyar karne ka hissa nahi, bas likhne ka hissa sab theek hoga. Sahi, puri baat ek din pehle hi khatam karne ki koshish karni chahiye. Theek hai. Toh main yahaan kuch koshish karne ki koshish karna chahta hoon. Theek hai. Aur yeh hum pehle motivation ke saath saath jo kaam karte aaye hain, usse kuch milta hoga. Ek, main sochta hoon ki yeh kaam kam se kam ek raat se zyada mein karne se asaani ho sakti hai. Kyunki abhi toh zyada tar jo tum last raat mein kar rahe ho, yeh functional hai apne ko comfortable pace banane ke liye jaise ke, ek page likhne mein kitna waqt lagta hai?"
39,"out an hour, hour and a half?",symp/reasoning,7_39,P,crq,,दो से तीन घंटे के बीच में कितना समय
40,So around an hour to an hour and a half? You can complete one page. Edited proof read?,inactive,7_40,T,cd,,Kya ek ghante ke as paas ek ghanta se ek ghanta aur adha lagega? Tum ek page pooraa kar sakte ho. Saansodhan karke theek hai?
41,Yeah.,inactive,7_41,P,ack,,Haan.
42,"Okay. So it would take about five days. To complete the whole paper, if you did an hour and a half each day, an hour to one I haven't checked. Okay. But how much time do you have from when the papers assigned to when it's due?",story,7_42,T,crq,,"Theek hai. Agar aap har din aadhe ghante kaam karte ho toh poora paper lagbhag paanch din mein ho jayega, lekin, maine nahi check kiya hai. Theek hai. Lekin, papers assign hone se lekar due date tak aapke paas kitna samay hai?"
43,"They give us about a week and a half to do,",story,7_43,P,cd,,Unko hume ek hafta it war tak kaam karne ke liye dete hain.
44,I guess around 10 days. Yeah.,story,7_44,T,crq,,Mujhe lagta hai lagbhag 10 din ho gaye. Haan.
45,"Um, I guess around six o'clock, like, because then I'm already done eating home from work. And I've kind of de stressed already. Six o'clock looks like a",story,7_45,P,cdd,,"मुझे लगता है कि सायं छह बजे से थोड़ा सा पहले,क्योंकि तब मैं काम से घर लौटकर खाना खाने के बाद हो जाता हूं। और मैं पहले से ही तनाव रहित हो जाता ह"
46,"pretty good time. So if you could work without distraction, you would be done by around 730 at the latest with this one page.",story,7_46,T,irq,,"pretty achha waqt. Toh agar aap bina beech mein kisi cheez ki taraf dhyaan na de, toh aap is ek panna se lagbhag 730 tak kaam ho jayenge."
47,"Yeah, what the one page Okay, so",story,7_47,P,id,,"Haan, ek page kya Bilkul, toh"
48,"no distractions. Just one page. Yeah. All right. So let's talk about the the episodes, the TV episodes that you want to watch. Okay? How long are they,",story,7_48,T,gc,,"Bina kisi wafadari se. Bas ek page. Haan. Theek hai. Toh chalo hum the TV episodes ki baat karte hai, jisse tum dekhna chahte ho. Theek hai na? Kitne lambi hai woh."
49,"they're an hour to an hour, okay?",story,7_49,P,gc,,"Woh ek ghanta upar se ek ghanta tak, theek hai?"
50,"And once a time that you could watch those, you get the maximum enjoyment out of watching, like no distractions, I guess, ",story,7_50,T,gc,,"Aur ek baar jab aap unhe dekhte the, toh aapko unhe dekhne mein poora anand milta tha, bilkul koi bhi beech mein nahi, main sochta hun."
51,"I guess around eight o'clock because that's when I'm you know, started getting ready for bed and starting to like really relax. And, you know, my husband's home by that time and we can watch it together. He loves the show too.",story,7_51,P,gc,,"Me lagta hai around eight baje kyunki tab main apni tyyari shuru kar rahi hoti hoon so bilkul bister ki taraf jaa rahi hoon aur sach mein thoda relax ho rahi hoon. Aur, jaise hi mera husband ghar par aata hai uss waqt hum mil kar dekh sakte hain. Unhe bhi woh show bahut pasand hai."
52,"Okay. So eight o'clock, so really good time for you to maximize",story,7_52,T,gc,,"Theek. So eight bajegi, so really nice time for you to dakshata badhana."
53,"married. And that's a great,",story,7_53,P,gc,,Shaadi shuda hai. Aur vo bahut achha hai.
54,"you know, that's a great motivator for you. And I want to try to use it as a motivator. Kind of like a reward. Okay, so I'd like you to try to do is when you start, like when you get all these papers assigned when the five, five page papers, pick the five nights that you want to work on it. Okay, it could be Monday through Friday or whatever works for you. ",symp/reasoning,7_54,T,ci,,"तुम जानते हो, वो तुम्हारे लिए एक शानदार प्रेरक है। और मैं इसे एक प्रेरक के रूप में उपयोग करने की कोशिश करना चाहता हूं। जैसे कि एक पुरस्कार की तरह। ठीक है, तो मैं चाहता हूं कि तुम शुरू करने की कोशिश करो, जैसे ही तुम पांच पत्रों को असाइन करे, जो आप चाहते हो उसकेलिए से पाँच नाइट को चुनो। ठीक है, यह मंगलवार से शुक्रवार या आपके लिए जो भी काम करे।"
55,Okay.,inactive,7_55,P,ack,,Thik hai.
56,"All right, clearly within the 10 day window, though, all right, so five days within the 10 day window, do you have to turn in and then set that time at six o'clock is when you're going to start because that's a good time for you to work.",symp/reasoning,7_56,T,ci,,"Thik hai, gehre andar 10 din ke andar, lekin theek hai, toh paanch din 10 din ke andar, kya tumhe jama karna hai aur phir us time ko chhe baje start karna hai kyunki woh tumhare liye kaam ka samay hai."
57,So let's keep thinking about that when I feel like I'm getting off track.,symp/reasoning,7_57,P,crq,,Toh chalo hum uspe sochte rahenge jab mujhe lagta hai ki mai baatak raha hu.
58,"Yeah, that's sure.",inactive,7_58,T,cd,,"Haan, that's pakka."
59,Yeah. and not have to stress right at the end.,routine,7_59,P,crq,,Yeah. aur ant mei pareshan hone ki jarurat nahi hogi.
60,"Yeah. And not waste that time in the middle. Yeah. Right. That's, that's really eating more time and your show takes",routine,7_60,T,cd,,Haan. Aur beech mein woh samay barbaad na karo. Haan. Sahi hai. Wohi bahot zyada samay kha jaata hai aur aapki dikhane mein tabdaar banata hai.
61,I see where you're gonna. Absolutely.,routine,7_61,P,ack,,Mai dekhta hu kaha ja rahe ho tum. Bilkul sahi.
62,"Does this make sense to you understand kind of,",routine,7_62,T,yq,,Kya ye tujhe samajh mein aata hai thoda sa?
63,"yeah, you know, that helped me power through and not do things unrelated by you think well, if I get this paper done This page doesn't need to watch my show later.",routine,7_63,P,ack,,"Yeah, you know na, that helped me power through and not do things unrelated but you think well, if I get this paper done, toh yeh page dekhne ki zaroorat nahi padegi mere show ko baad mein."
64,"And I think that's a that's a helpful way to think about it. And that's, that's the cognitive part of this. So this is a kind of this is a behavioral strategy because we've talked about these in the past, right? This is behavioral strategy, the cognitive pieces, when you find yourself wandering, I think you have to detect that. And you I think you have some level awareness that's happening. Yeah, you have to detect that and say, I want to watch my show, and we're looking forward to it. ",routine,7_64,T,gc,,"Aur main sochta hun ki yeh ek madadgaar tarika hai iske baare mein sochne ka. Aur yeh hai, yeh hai iss ka cognitive hissa. Toh yeh ek prakar ka behavioral strategy hai kyunki hamne pichhle mein in baato pe baat ki hai, theek hai? Yeh ek behavioral strategy hai, cognitive sections, jab aap khud ko bhatakne mein paate hain, toh main sochta hun ki aapko usse pehchaan lena chahiye. Aur aapke paas usme hote huye kuchh level ki jagrukta hai, haan, aapko usse pehchaan leni chahiye aur kehna chahiye, main apne show ko dekhna chahta hun, aur hum usse besabri se intezaar kar rahe hain."
65,Okay.,inactive,7_65,P,ack,,Theek hai.
66,"And that's your motivation to move through the paper. And then you know, when eight o'clock comes, okay.",inactive,7_66,T,orq,,"Aur yeh hai aapki motivation ki aap kagaz ke through aage badhne ke liye hai. Fir aap jaan jayenge ki jab aath baje aayega, toh thik hai."
67,"All right, that sounds like a plan. All right.",inactive,7_67,P,od,,"Thik hai, ya to ek plan lagta hai. Thik hai."
68,Very good. So let's try that for. I'll see again in roughly two weeks.,routine,7_68,T,ci,,Bahut achha. To chalo fir hum woh karne ki koshish karenge. Maine do hafte baad firse dekh lena hai.
69,Yep. All right. Thank you. So a few weeks.,inactive,7_69,P,ack,,Haan. Thik hai. Dhanyavaad. Toh kuchh hafte.
70,All right. Thank you. Thanks.,inactive,7_70,T,gt,,All right. Dhanyavaad. Shukriya.
71,summary,"The patient wishes to work out motivation to write papers. The paper is five pages long and they start with references. Once they complete the references, they get sidetracked easily. The patient ends up killing two hours of their time and rush to do everything at the last minute. The therapist clarifies the patient is not highly motivated to write. The therapist suggests to break down five page paper into five days and pick the evenings at six o' clock in the 10 day window when they wish to do. The patient could reward themselves if they are successful by watching their favorite TV show in the night which will be a great motivator. The therapist explains this is cognitive part of behavioral strategy and confirms to meet again in roughly two weeks.",,,,,
