0,"between here and there, obviously, if it were easy, you wouldn't need me, you wouldn't have 13 therapists. If this were easy you would have been to a life you wanted a long time ago. So it's obvious that it's easy it already be done. Because it sounds like you're a person with a lot of motivation works really hard, because there are very few people who wouldn't quit before 13 therapists. So that's a very good quality. The very fact that you've gone through all these therapists is a good sign for us. Nonetheless, it is difficult. between here and there, there's going to be hell. Exactly. Right. So I figure our number one priority has to be to get you to stay alive through house so that we can get to the life you want. If that's where we're at. Now. We got to have some sort of agreement, not by writing a contract. Because I'll fire you if you try to kill yourself that because we both sort of have to face the fact that to get there you got to go through there and to go through there you got to stay alive.",symp/reasoning,103_0,T,id,,"Yahaan aur vahaan ke beech, pataakha par clear hai, agar yeh aasaan hota, toh mujhe zaroorat nahi padti, tumhe 13 therapists nahi chahiye hote. Agar yeh aasaan hota, toh tum pehle hi apne zindagi ke maqsad tak pahunch chuke hote. Isliye yeh saf clear hai ki asaani se ho chuka hoga. Kyunki tum ek aise insaan ho jo ek bahut badi motivation ke saath kaam karta hai, kyunki bohot kam log aise hote hain jo 13 therapists se pehle haar maan dete hain. Isliye yeh ek bahut accha quality hai. Yehi vajah hai ki tumne saare therapists ke saath guzara hai, yeh humare liye ek achha indication hai. Lekin, yeh mushkil hai. Yahaan aur vahaan ke beech, na jaane kya sitaare chadhenge. Sahi baat. Isliye maine socha ki humara sabse bada maksad yeh hona chahiye ki tum jeevit rehke mauke pe zindagi ko jeeto, taki hum tumhe woh zindagi de sake jiski tumhe khwaish thi. Agar hum yahaan hain toh. Ab humein kuch agreement hona chahiye, koi contract pe likhke nahi, kyunki agar tumne khudko maarna koshish bhi ki toh main tumhe nikal dunga, kyunki hum dono ko yeh samajhna padega ki wahaan pahunchne ke liye, tumhe yahaan se guzarna hoga, aur yahaan se guzarne ke liye, tumhe zinda rehna hoga."
