Mujhe lagta hai ki main pehle se zyada saaf dimaag se soch raha hu."
4,"So, can you can tell me a little bit more about that?",routine,169_4,T,irq,0,"Toh, kya tum mujhe uske baare mein thoda aur bata sakte ho?"
5,"Um, well, one we've talked before, I've had the feelings and the thoughts of suicide, but now it's kind of starting to like I'm thinking about it more often. I'm thinking about a little more clearly and that's alarming to me. ",symp/reasoning,169_5,P,id,-1,"Hmm, well, abhi to hum baat kar chuke hain, mujhe suicide ki bhavnaayein aur vichaar aa rahe the, par ab mujhe aisa lagta hai ki main iske baare mein zyada soch rahi hoon. Mujhe ek dum se zyada saaf dimaag se sochne lagi hai aur yeh mere liye khatarnaak hai."
6,Do you want to die?,routine,169_6,T,yq,0,Kya tum mar na chahte ho?

Yeah. ",symp/reasoning,169_9,P,cd,-1,"Um, I mean, you know, Sometimes I know, Trying it would be very scary and my husband would be so hurt, but at the same time, I want to end this. I want to end the feeling of being depressed. Yeah."
10,Okay. Do you have any plan as to how you would end your life if you decide to do that?,routine,169_10,T,irq,0,ठीक है। क्या आपके पास यह तय करने का कोई प्लान है कि आप जब ऐसा करने का फैसला करें तो अपनी जिं
11,"I mean, I know if I wanted to that we have pills in the cabinet. So it wouldn't be that hard, I could just take the bottle and ",symp/reasoning,169_11,P,id,-1,"Main, I know agar main chahoon toh humare pas cabinet mein goliyan hai. Isliye itna mushkil bhi nahi hoga, bas main bottle lekar le sakti hu aur"
12,just same pills that you prescribed for depression?,routine,169_12,T,crq,0,आपने अभी कुछ ही पिल्स प्रभालित की हैं
13,Yeah.,inactive,169_13,P,cd,0,Haan.
14,Do you feel like you're going to carry out that plan?,routine,169_14,T,yq,0,Kya tumhe lagta hai ki tum wo plan karye ke liye tayyar ho?
15,"No, I mean, part of it. That's why I'm nervous because like, I'm worried that I might, but at the same time, You know, I'm afraid to so sometimes I think that I might and sometimes I think I won't. I don't want to but sometimes I get scared that I will.",symp/reasoning,169_15,P,on,-1,"Nahi, mera matlab hai, uska ek hissa. Isiliye mein nervous hoon kyunki jaise ki, mujhe dar hai ki shayad mein kar sakta hoon, par wahi samay, tum jaante ho na, kabhi kabhi mujhe dar lagta hai toh mein sochta hoon ki shayad kar lunga aur kabhi sochta hoon ki nahi karunga. Mujhe nahi karna hai, par kabhi kabhi mujhe darr lagta hai ki kar sakta hoon."
16,"Today you're a little worried that you will, or you're a little closer to it then than usual. We've talked about this before in the past, you've come in, you've had kind of that same plan to pills and the thoughts and what what stops you those times was stuck in the past.",routine,169_16,T,gc,0,"Aaj kal tu thoda chintit lag raha hai ki tu aaenga, ya tu iss baat se thoda zyada nazdeek hai. Humne pehle bhi iske bare mein baat kiya hai, tu aaega, tu pills lekar ayega, aur vichar karega aur phir wohi cheez tumhare mann se rokti hai jo pehle hamesha past mein atak jaati thi."
17,"In the past, I thought, this will get better. I just have to keep trying, I thought what will my husband feel when I'm gone and my family, my parents, my brother and sister I thought that this is as bad as it can get. It has to get better eventually. But now I'm just starting to feel like I don't think it's gonna get better.",symp/reasoning,169_17,P,gc,-1,"Pichle me, main socha, yeh behtar hoga. Bas koshish jaari rakhni hogi, main socha ki mera pati ko kaisa lagega jab main chali jaaungi aur meri family, mere mummy-papa, mere bhai aur behen ko main socha ki yeh sabse bura haal hai. Yeh aakhir mein behtar ho jayega. Lekin ab mujhe lag raha hai ki yeh behtar hone waala nahi hai."
18,"Alright, so there's times before when you had the same feeling, right? You felt just as bad as you feel now really down hopeless. What happened a few days after that, after the thoughts suicide went away. What was your outlook on life that?",routine,169_18,T,gc,0,"Thik hai, toh pehle bhi kabhi aisa hi mehsoos hua hai na, jaise abhi tumhe bilkul udaas aur umeed se haar gayi ho? Kuch din baad kya hua, jab aapke mann se apne aapko maarne ki soch chali gayi thi? Tab tumhare zindagi par aapka kya nazariya tha?"
19,"I mean, I feel I feel a little better. You know, and then I'd say to myself, that was silly, you know, I don't want to do that. I don't, I don't want to end things. You know. It's It's too rash. But you know, it's starting to feel like a permanent problem.",symp/reasoning,169_19,P,id,-1,"Main toh kehna chahta hoon, mujhe thoda sa achcha lag raha hai. Tu jaanta hai, fir main khud se kehta hoon, yeh toh bewakoofi thi, main toh yeh nahi karna chahta. Main chaahta nahi ki sab khatam ho jaaye. Pata hai. Yeh bahut achanak ho jaayega. Par tu jaanta hai, yeh ek permanent samasya lagne laga hai."
20,So if you feel like this time these suicidal thoughts are markedly different than what you've experienced before.,routine,169_20,T,crq,0,"So agar tumhe aisa lagta hai ki is baar ye suicide ke vichaar pehle se kaafi alag hai, jo tumne pehle kabhi mehsoos nahi kiya tha."
21,"I wouldn't say markedly but I would say they're different. They're a little they're stronger,",symp/reasoning,169_21,P,cd,-1,"Main keh nahi sakta ki bahut zyada, lekin yeh nahi kaungi ki woh bilkul alag hai. Woh thode se zyada majboot hai."
22,more intense?,routine,169_22,T,crq,0,aur jyada gehra?
23,yeah,inactive,169_23,P,cd,0,haan
24,"When you think about this, these feelings on before we talked about I know this relationship surrounding relationships, the same thing this time?",routine,169_24,T,irq,-,"When you think about this, yeh jaankar ki hamne pehle baat ki iss rishte ke baare mein, kya iss baar bhi wahi haal hai?"
25,"I mean, I guess that has something to do with it, I guess. It's just like when I look to everything, like everything that could be good or everything, just everything like life, my relationships, the future I just look at it and I see despair. I just see everything going wrong. And I just don't see how it could get better. I just don't see it",symp/reasoning,169_25,P,id,-1,"I mean, mujhe lagta hai ki iska kuchh na kuchh sambandh hoga, sayad. Bas aise hi jab main sab kuchh dekhta hoon, jaise sab kuchh achha ho sakta hai ya sab kuchh, bas sab kuchh jaise zindagi, mera rishthe, bhavishya main dekhta hoon aur mujhe nirasha dikhti hai. Bas main har cheez ulta ho rahi hai dekhti hoon. Aur main nahi samajhti ki kaise sahi ho sakta hai. Bas nahi dikhta mujhe."
26,in a sense of hopelessness?,routine,169_26,T,crq,0,Kya ye nirasata ka ek ehsaas hai?
27,Yes.,inactive,169_27,P,cd,0,Haan.
28,"So this time is different because you feel it's very less situational, less tired of relationships and more, Well, philosophical, you're looking at your outlook and you're saying it's not gonna get any better. What's the point going on? So this is a little bit new territory for you. How long we've been feeling this way with the  intensity right now?",routine,169_28,T,gc,0,"Is baar alag hai kyunki tumhe lagta hai ki yeh bahut kam situationa hai, rishton se kam thak gaye hai aur zyada, Matlabi, tum apni nazariye se dekh rahe ho aur keh rahe ho ki kuch sudhar nahi hoga. To aage kya fayda hai? Isliye yeh thoda naya kshetra hai tumhare liye. Kitne samay se aise mehsoos kar rahe ho ab itni had tak?"
29,"Probably a week, maybe a little less",symp/reasoning,169_29,P,id,-1,"Shayad ek hafte se kam bhi ho sakta hai, shayad thoda kam bhi."

31,"I'm afraid to do it. I'm just scared. It's like It's like jumping off a diving board. Like you get up to the edge and you stand there, that's where that",symp/reasoning,169_31,P,id,-1,मैं डर रहा हूँ। मैं बस डरा हुआ हूँ। यह कुछ ऐसा है जैसे तैरने का बोर्ड से उतर जाना। जैसे कि आप उस आकार की शुरुआत करते हैं और वहाँ तक ख
32,"Have you made any gestures to harm yourself? Like if you went and grabbed the pills or went to the medicine cabinet looks at the pills, anything like that. ",routine,169_32,T,irq,0,"Kya aapne khud ko nuksaan pahuchane ke liye koi harkat ki hai? Jaise ki aap pills uthane gaye ho ya medicine cabinet mein jakar pills ko dekha hai, kuch aisi koi cheez."
33,"Sometimes I look at them, look at them. ",symp/reasoning,169_33,P,id,-1,"Kabhi kabhi main unhe dekhta hoon, dekhta hoon."
34,Don't think further than look at them?,routine,169_34,T,irq,0,Sirf unhe dekho to aur aagey na socho?
35,"Well, I mean, so I have to take them. It's my prescription. So when it's time I start thinking about it. Like it's more I think about my like, the ideations come even more because it's like a trigger like I'm thinking about the pills. So I go to the cabinet, and I get my pills and I and I take the, the one that I'm supposed to, but I just look at the bottle and I kind of stand there and I just think Instead of putting the bottle back, I could take it with me.",story,169_35,P,id,-1,"Arre yaar, mujhe lene hi padenge, meri prescription hai. Jab waqt ayega na tab mujhe sochna padega. Aur mujhe sochte rehne se zyada sochne lag jaati hai, kyunki yeh ek trigger hai, mujhe pills ke baare mein sochne par. Toh main cabinet ko jaati hun, aur pills ko lekar ajati hun, aur meri prescription mein likhi hui pills lene lagti hun. Lekin main sirf bottle ko dekhti hun, aur wahin khadi ho jaati hun, aur sochti hun ki bottle wapas rakhne ke bajay main use apne saath leke chali jaun."
36,And what do you end up doing?,routine,169_36,T,irq,0,Aur tum kya karne ke liye khud ko paate ho?
37,"It takes a while but I put it back. It's It's scary. Like I look into the bottle and I'm afraid because dying is scary, but ",symp/reasoning,169_37,P,id,-1,"Thodi der lagti hai par maine ek baar phir voh vaapas rakkha hai. Voh voh daravna hai. Jaise main botal mein dekhti hun aur main darta hun kyonki maut ka darr hai, par wo bhaari hai."
38,and how about the pain that you would cause husband and the rest of your family?,routine,169_38,T,irq,0,Aur shohar aur aapke parivar ko pahunchaayi jaane waali dard ke baare mein kya sochti hai?
39,"Yeah, I don't want to do that. ",symp/reasoning,169_39,P,id,-1,"Haan, mujhe vaisa nahi karna hai."
40,You don't want that?,routine,169_40,T,yq,0,Kya tumhe woh chahiye nahi hai?
41,"I don't. I don't. I don't want my husband to find me, I don't want him to feel like this is his fault. I don't want him to be sad that I'm gone. I don't want him to feel like I feel.",symp/reasoning,169_41,P,on,-1,"Mujhe nahi chahiye. Main nahi chahiye. Mujhe apne pati ko mujhe dhoondne se bachana nahi hai, mujhe nahi chahti wo apni galti maan le. Mujhe nahi chahti wo dukhi ho ki main chali gayi hun. Mujhe nahi chahti hai wo mujh jaisa feel kare."
42,"And when relatives of somebody that committed suicide, hear about the suicide? Who do they blame? ",routine,169_42,T,irq,0,"Aur jab koi atmaghati ka rishtedar jaanta hai, toh atmaghati ke baare mein sunta hai? Usmein kaun dosh deta hai?"
43,Yeah. It's not it's not their fault. And I know that they wouldn't be able to get over it and I know that they'll be thinking about how bad I felt they'll have to know what it really felt like for me.,symp/reasoning,169_43,P,id,-1,Haan. Yeh unki koi khata nahi hai. Aur main jaanti hu ki woh isse bardaasht nahi kar payenge aur mujhe pata hai ki woh mere liye kitna bura mehsoos kar rahe honge par unhe pata hona chahiye ki mujhe asli mein kaisa mehsoos hua.
44,So I know this is a tough time right? But the good news is you're here talking to me about it. Right? Now you're talking about it. I'm gonna guess that you want to do something for bad to feel better. Are you gonna carry out your plan or you're gonna hurt yourself?,routine,169_44,T,gc,0,"Toh main jaanta hun ki yeh ek mushkil samay hai, lekin achhi khabar hai ki tum yahan mere saath iske baare mein baat kar rahe ho. Sahi hai na? Ab tum iske baare mein baat kar rahe ho. Main yeh samajh ta hun ki tum bura hone se better feel karne ke liye kuch karna chahte ho. Kya tum apna plan execute karoge ya phir khud ko hurt karoge?"
45,I don't want to,symp/reasoning,169_45,P,on,-1,मैं नहीं चाहता ह
46,are you going to?,routine,169_46,T,yq,0,Kya tum jaa rahe ho?
47,"No, I think I think if I can just remember what it'll be like for them. That'll keep me from doing it. You know, it's the times that I forget to think about how they're going to feel that I get closer to the edge. But when I remember, you know, like, It upsets me to think about what it'll be like for them. So if I can remember to think about that and it'll help me not do that. But I think having the pills there in the cabinet like that is a big temptation for me.",symp/reasoning,169_47,P,on,-1,"Nahi, mujhe lagta hai ki agar main bas unke liye kaise ho sakta hoon, to main waisa karna bhi nahi chahta. Pata hai, jab main bhool jaata hoon ki woh kis tarah se mehsoos karenge, tab main khud ko kareeb sekhun jaata hoon. Par jab main yaad karta hoon, jaise ki unke liye waisa hona kitna bechaini bhara hua hai, toh main uske baare mein sochne se roohani taur par pareshaan hota hoon. Isliye agar main us cheez ko yaad rakh sakoon aur unke liye vishwasniya ho sakta hoon, toh main uska sev karna se bacha sakta hoon. Lekin mujhe lagta hai ki meri liye pills cabinet ke andar waise maujood hone ka bada khatra hai."
48,"Okay, so can we can we do this? Your husband's at home? Right. You mentioned you take two pills once a day?",routine,169_48,T,gc,0,"Thik hai, toh hum yeh kar sakte hain? Tumhare pati ghar pe hain? Sahi. Tumne kaha ki tum ek din mein do pills lete ho?"

Just give you the pill each night take one and I will that be okay?,routine,169_52,T,gc,0,क्या हम आपसे अनुरोध कर सकते हैं की आप उससे बात करने के लिए रिलीज़ साइन करने को तैयार हो? वह उन पिल्स को धरने में सक्षम हो सकता है। सिर्फ हर रात एक गोली दे दीजिये और क्या मैं ठीक हूँ
53,"Yeah, I think I think that would be a good idea.",inactive,169_53,P,id,0,"Haan, mai sochta hu ki mujhe lagta hai ki ye ek achha idea hoga."
54,Is there anything else in the medicine cabinet or anywhere else in the house to give you a danger to?,routine,169_54,T,yq,0,Kya dawa ka thekaanedaar ya ghar ke kisi aur jagah par aapko khatra hai kya?
55,"I think, I think yeah, I think it would be a good idea to just make sure that everything that was in the medicine cabinet",symp/reasoning,169_55,P,op,-1,"I think, I think yeah, Main sochta hun ke yeh sahi rahega, ke hum bas yeh yaqeen kar le ke har cheez jo dawaiyoon ke khane mein thi, woh cabinet mein thi."
56,all the tools?,routine,169_56,T,crq,0,sabhi tools?
57,yeah.,inactive,169_57,P,cd,0,हाँ
58,Would he be willing to do that?,routine,169_58,T,yq,0,Kya voh use karne ke liye tayar hoga?
59,"Right. Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that he would be willing to do that. He doesn't. He wants me to get through this. ",symp/reasoning,169_59,P,op,-1,"Haanji. Haan, mujhe lagta hai, haan, mujhe lagta hai ki woh usse karne ke liye tayaar hoga. Woh nahi karta hai. Usse chahiye ki main iss par se guzar jau."

62,"Okay. Are you familiar before, are you familiar with this concept we talked about before contracting for safety, or the prior time. So, you've been the state similar to this. Can you promise me that you're going to not hurting yourself.",routine,169_62,T,gc,0,"Thik hai. Kya aap pehle se jaante hain, kya aap is concept ke baare mein baat kiye the pehle safety ke liye, ya pehle time pe. Toh, aap iss se kuch aise state mein the. Kya aap mujhe vaada kar sakte hain ki aap apne aap ko hurt nahi karenge."
63,"I can Yeah, I can do that. At least until next week when we meet again, I promise.",symp/reasoning,169_63,P,cr,-1,"Main kar sakti hoon, haan, main wahi kar sakti hoon. Kam se kam agle hafte tak, jab hum phir milein, maein wada karti hoon."
64,"Let's be a little certain that okay, sets up that for a more. ",routine,169_64,T,gc,0,"Chalo thoda sa pakka bana lete hain, thik hai, vo hamare liye zyada faaydemand hoga."

66,"I know this is a rough time trying to appreciate how rough it is for you. I want you to keep in mind how you felt after the times before. Now you do tend to pull out of this. And you look back at a lot differently. But in the moment, it's hard to see that. That doesn't necessarily make this any easier. But if you can hang on to we can get through this cycle of depression. You'll probably have a different outlook. If history is any evidence. Does that make sense? ",routine,169_66,T,id,0,"Mujhe pata hai yeh bura waqt hai, mujhe samajhna hai ki is bura waqt ka ahista ahista dabdaba aapke liye kaisa hai. Main aapse yeh chahti hu ki aap pehle waqt mein apne aap ko aisa mehsus karte the uss waqt ki yaad rakhen. Ab aap is se bahar nikal sakte hain. Phir dekhiye, aap bahut khulle kapde ki tarah iss dard ko dekhenge. Par waqt ke halat mein, yeh sab dikhai nahi deta. Yeh aasan toh nahi banata par agar aap khewayi banaye rakhsakte hain, hum yeh depression ki daur se guzar sakte hain. Shayad aapka nazariya badal jayega.
