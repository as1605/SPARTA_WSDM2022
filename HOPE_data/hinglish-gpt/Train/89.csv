0,"So Charles, it sounds like things have been going pretty well recently,",inactive,89_0,T,id,,"So Charles, lagta hai ki chal raha hai ki haal hi mein kaafi ache chal rahe hain"
1,"but they've been going better. Yeah, they have good I did call a friend. And we had lunch. I'd seen this guy in two or three years and it was good to see him when we contacted again and agreed we maybe have lunch. From time to time, that'd be good. And I got back in the kitchen, I made this pretty good soup. It's an asparagus potato soup that sounds very it's it's really good to chop up the asparagus and the potatoes and one small onion and boil them and then use a blender to give it a real nice texture, texture a little bit like split pea soup, sounds good without a split pea and so on. feeling some better. ",story,89_1,P,id,,"Lekin voh tho achchhe ho rahe the. Haan, unhe achchha lag raha tha ki maine ek dost ko call kiya. Aur humne lunch kiya. Maine is insaan ko do-teen saal mein dekha tha aur achchha laga ki hum phir se milne wale they aur hum ne theek hai mana liya ki hum lunch karenge. Kabhi kabhi, voh achchha hoga. Aur main rasoi mein wapas gaya, maine yeh kaafi achchha soup banaya. Yeh ek asparagus aloo ka soup hai jo ki bohot hi badiya lag raha hai. Aasafalish rasoi mein asparagus aur aloo ko kaat ke ubalenge aur phir blender mein daalen isse ek asal achchhi mahak dega aur split pea soup se thodi alag sound karega. Bina split pea ke bhi voh badiya lag raha tha. Ab bohot had taqleef kam ho rahi hai."
2,"That's good. That's good. Charles, I'm proud of you for taking the initiative. Because I know it's been difficult in the past and you've really championed the things we've talked about, and I'm really proud of you for that. One thing you didn't mention was the woodworking shop that we've talked about in the past is that has that been?",routine,89_2,T,id,,"Accha hai. Accha hai. Charles, tum pe garv hai mujhe ki tumne apne aapko behtar banane ke liye koshish ki. Kyunki main jaanta hu ki peechle samay mein yeh mushkil tha, aur tumne hamein hamare baare mein baat kiya hai, aur main tumhare uss kaam par bahut garv hai. Ek cheez jisse tumne baar baar baat nahi ki hai, woh hai woodworking ki dukaan, jo pehle humne baat kiya tha, kya woh hamesha se hi hai?"
3,"Well, that's still a mess. Okay, in fact, it's a it's a it's it's a big mess. It's such a mess that I really can't get in there and do any work. I haven't done that for some time. Okay. Every surface every why we got to work benches and",routine,89_3,P,cd,,"Achha, wo abhi bhi ek badi musibat hai. Theek hai, sach mein, yeh ek bahut badi musibat hai. Aisi badi musibat hai ki main usme jaake kaam nahi kar paa raha hu. Maine kafi samay se aisa nahi kiya. Theek hai. Har jaga, har surface pe hume work benches chahiye aur kaam karna hoga."
4,"Kinda Okay, well as we've talked about in the past, it's really difficult to get started on some things that we've avoided for quite some time. So, like in the past, let's brainstorm. Try to figure out how we can get some some movement in the woodworking shops. That sound good. Sure. Okay, so so one thing we've discussed in the past, Charles is extremely important is what you're thinking about as you're going into the woodworking shop. So, what are your thoughts? When you are viewing or looking at the woodworking shop? What do you think?",story,89_4,T,irq,,"Thoda sa theek hai, vaise toh humne pehle bhi baat ki hai ki kaafi mushkil hai kuch kaam shuru karne mein jo humne kafi samay se avoid kar rahe hai. Toh, pehle ki tarah, chalo brainstorming karein. Koshish karo ki hum woodworking dukaano mein kuch movement laa sakte hai. Yeh accha lag raha hai na. Bilkul. Theek hai, toh ek cheez humne pehle bhi discuss ki hai, Charles ke liye kaafi zaroori hai ki tum apne dimaag mein kya soch rahe ho jab tum woodworking dukaan mein ja rahe ho. Toh, tumhare khayalaat kya hai? Jab tum woodworking dukaan ko dekh rahe ho ya dekh rahe ho? Tum kya sochte ho?"
5,"Well, when I stand there in it, and I feel helpless, I mean it. It's hopeless, it seems to me that okay, just get it back in shape again.",symp/reasoning,89_5,P,id,,"Achha, jab mai usmei khada hota hu, aur mujhe bebas mehsoos hota hai, tab mai saccha bolta hu. Yeh nirashajanak hai, mujhe aisa lagta hai ki thik hai, fir se uski halat sudhaar lelo."
6,"Okay, so let's explore that. So. So what's the evidence that it's hopeless to do some work in the woodworking shop?",symp/reasoning,89_6,T,irq,,"Okay, toh chalo explore karte hain. Toh. Toh kya ye hai saboot ki kaam karne ka koi asar nahi hoga woodworking shop mein?"
7,"Well, just the mess that it is. I mean, that how disorganized and",symp/reasoning,89_7,P,id,,"Well, bas woh hi gandagi hai jo hai. Mera matlab hai, uska kitna vyavasthaheen aur"
8,"Okay, so it sounds like you're saying then it's disorganized. And it's a mess.  So how do you feel when you think about the woodworking shop that way?",routine,89_8,T,orq,,"Okay, toh tum keh rahe ho ki yeh bawaal hai. Aur yeh ek gadbad hai. Toh phir aise sochne pe tumhe kaisa lagta hai woodworking workshop ke baare mein?"
9,"hopeless, okay, I think just",routine,89_9,P,od,,"बेहाल, ठीक है, मुझे"
10,"Okay. So it prevents you from actually getting things done is what you're saying? Yes. Okay. Which makes sense because if I thought about it that way to Charles, it would be hard for me to initiate any kind of action because if I view it as overwhelming, then I'm probably They're not gonna do anything, which makes sense. So, so what do you think is an alternative way to view the woodworking shop? That would actually be helpful? What's another way?",story,89_10,T,irq,,"Tikke hai. So basically, yeh aapko kaam karne se rokta hai, yeh hai aap keh rahe ho? Haan. Okay. Yeh samajhna bhi aasan hai kyunki agar main is tarah se Charles ke liye sochungi toh kaafi mushkil ho jayega mujhe koi bhi kaam shuru karna kyunki agar main usse bahut mushkil samajhungi toh shayad main kuch bhi na karungi, isme kuch samajh aata hai. Toh, toh kya aapko lagta hai ki woodworking shop ko ek alag tarah se dekhne ka koi aur tareeka hai jo asal mein kaam aaye? Aur koi raasta hai?"
11,"Well, if I could get one workbench cleaned off, okay, I would have some space to work on.",routine,89_11,P,id,,"Achha, agar mujhe ek workbench saaf karne ka mauka milta, tab main kuchh jagah par kaam kar sakta."
12,"Okay, that's a really good start.",routine,89_12,T,id,,"Tik hai, yeh ek bahut accha shuruat hai."
13,"Well, I could make some things that I've been thinking about making for some time. Okay, I kind of have the plans in my head. Okay. I've thought about a medieval, kind of small medieval catapult for my grandson. And maybe Boomerang made out of really nice laminated wood, that would be cool. And so I could get one or both of those built, perhaps.",story,89_13,P,id,,"Acha, main kuch cheezen bana sakti hu, jo main aur soch rahi thi kuch samay se. Thik hai, mere dimaag me unki planning hai. Thik hai. Mere mann me ek purane jamane ki choti choti taa gere ke baare me socha hai mere pothe ke liye. Aur shayad main ek Boomerang bhi bana sakti hu, jisse khubsurat laminate ki lakdi se banaya hoga, wo kaafi khushnuma hoga. Isi tarah mai ek ya dono me se koi bhi bana sakti hu, shayad."
14,Okay? And what would that lead to? If you get those things built? What would you have to do anything with those things?,routine,89_14,T,irq,,Okay? Aur yeh kahan par pahunche ga? Agar aap woh cheezen bana lete ho? Toh aapko uske saath kuch karna padega?
15,"Well, if I if I built those, I would have to get in the car and drive for hours today. Okay, my grandkids where my grandkids are and to give them the, the toys, okay, and show them how it works and have shown how to throw the boomerang.",story,89_15,P,id,,"""Well, agar main woh banata toh mujhe aaj gadi mein baithna aur ghante bhar ke liye drive karna padta. Theek hai, mere grandkids jahaan mere grandkids hain wahaan jaana padega aur unhe khilauna dena, theek hai, aur unhe dikhana kaise kaam karta hai aur boomerang ko kaise throw karna hai unhe dikhana padega."""
16,"So it sounds like there's a lot of benefit then to clearing out a bench and moving tools which would lead to you getting things done, especially things that would involve your grandkids so you'd be able to see them and spend time with with them, you'd feel better about going to do that. But you'd also feel better about the woodworking shop in general that basically what you're saying would Yeah, okay, sure. But as we've talked about in the past, Charles, I know that it still takes steps to get there. Right? That wouldn't change overnight. So I think one useful strategies for you and I to work on a step by step plan that would get us to the place of you being able to drive for hours to see your grandkids. So how about we talked about the first step, which sounds like would be to just move things off one bench? Does that sound right?",story,89_16,T,id,,"Toh yeh lag raha hai ki bench khali kar ke aur tools hata ke unhein shift karna bahut faydemand hai, jisse ki aap kaam ho jaenge, visheshkar aapke grandkids ke saath jo aap unhein dekh paenge aur unke saath thoda waqt bitaenge. Aap kaafi acha mehsoos karenge jab aap aisa karenge. Lekin aapko woodworking shop ke baare mein bhi kaafi acha lagega, matlab jaisa ki aap bol rahe hain. Haan, theek hai. Lekin jaisa ki humne pehle bhi baat ki hai, Charles, mujhe pata hai ki aisa hona ke liye kadam uthane padenge. Sahi hai? Woh ek raat mein nahin badlega. Isliye main sochta hun ki hum dono ke liye ek kaam ka ek step-by-step plan banana kaafi upyogi hoga, jo humein aapke grandkids ko dekhne ke liye ghante ghoomne ki haalat tak pahunchaega. To kyu na hum pehle step ke baare mein baat karte hain, jisse ki lag raha hai ki ek bench se cheezein shift karna hoga? Kya yeh sahi lagta hai?"
17,"Yeah, that Yeah, one.",routine,89_17,P,ack,,"Yeah, ek hai."
18,Okay. That sounds great.,inactive,89_18,T,acak,,Theek hai. Wahi bahut accha lagta hai.
19,Though.,inactive,89_19,P,gc,,थो
20,So let's talk about that. Then let's let's sketch out what each day would look like so that we won't won't feel overwhelmed like we did in the past. So let's talk about each day and how we would sketch out each day Does that sound good?,routine,89_20,T,yq,,Toh chalo uske baare mein baat karte hain. Fir har din ka sketch banaate hain taaki hum past ki tarah overwhelmed na feel kare. Toh chalo har din ke baare mein baat karte hain aur har din ka sketch kaise banega ye decide karte hain. Kya ye thik lagta hai?
21,Sure.,inactive,89_21,P,op,,जर
