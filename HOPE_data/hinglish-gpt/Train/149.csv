Oh my god, shift karu? Kitni pareshani hai par yeh hai, yehi samasya hai. Woh bas hai wahan. Woh hai, woh accessible hai."

25,"Maybe you're right. Yeah, that's that's good. Because before I didn't really want to stop at some, I mean, I definitely sometimes I want to stop, I'm my mind, I'll go back and forth. You know, but for the most part I would like to be without it. You know, I really don't want to deal with this anymore.",symp/reasoning,149_25,P,gc,-1.0,"Maybe tum sahi ho. Haan, woh achha hai. Kyunki pehle main kabhi kuch karna chahta hiin nahin tha, matlab, kabhi kabhi main rukna chahta tha, apni soch se palatna. Lekin zyada tarah se, main iss se door rehna chahunga.

33,It's painful. Definitely. Definitely. It feels like a trap. I want out.,symp/reasoning,149_33,P,op,-1.0,Yeh dard hai. Zaroor. Zaroor. Yeh ek jaal lagta hai. Main bahar nikalna chahta hu.
34,"And one of the ideas you're having was sound like potentially was moving out, moving out of the apartment, because then you wouldn't have access to the who would have access to the Adderall anymore? Or it would be hard to get ?",routine,149_34,T,crq,0.0,"Aur apke dimaag mein ek vichaar tha ki aakhir aap ghar se bahar chale jaenge, kyonki phir aapko Adderall ka koi istemaal nahi hoga? Ya use paana mushkil ho jayega?"
35,"Oh my god, like sometimes it's really weird. Sometimes it feels like that's a good idea. And then sometimes I'm like, No, no, I don't want to be You know kind of cut off from it but I think I am come ready. ",symp/reasoning,149_35,P,cd,-2.0,"Oh my god, jaise ki kabhi kabhi yeh sach mein bahut ajeeb hota hai. Kabhi kabhi lagta hai ki yeh ek badiya soch hai.

36,You think you're ready for that?,routine,149_36,T,orq,0.0,Tumhe lagta hai ki tum uske liye taiyar ho?
37,Yeah,inactive,149_37,P,od,0.0,ए ह
38,And that moving out you really see is what you would need to do. Because stopping while living there is too difficult.,routine,149_38,T,crq,0.0,Aur vo bahar nikalte hi aapko dikhta hai ki aapko kya karna chahiye. Kyunki rukna wahi rehte huye bahut mushkil hai.
39,"Yeah, yep, I think you're right.",inactive,149_39,P,cd,0.0,"Haan, ha, main toh tujhe sahi lagta hai."
40,"Remember before you've tried to stop living there a few times right or, or last few months and with your roommate having it with your roommate being the one that gives it to you. It just appears that temptation so great for you.",routine,149_40,T,gc,0.0,"Yaad rakhna, jab tumne ek kaam karne ke liye vaha rehna chaha hai toh kuch baar purane dino mein, ya fir pichle kuch mahino mein apne roommate ke saath rehne ke baare mein socha hai, jaha tumhare roommate hi woh insaan hai jo tumhe uss kaam ko karne ke liye prerit karta hai. Lagta hai ki ye tumhare liye itna bada mohkar hai ki tumhare liye behad kashish wala lagta hai."
41,"Yeah, she really doesn't get it. She doesn't understand like, What? What a problem this is for me? She's definitely not supporting me or anything like that. Yeah, God, maybe it would be better",symp/reasoning,149_41,P,gc,-2.0,"Yeah, uski to poora hi samajh nahi aa raha hai. Wo samajh nahi rahi hai ki What? Ye mere liye kitni mushkilat ka sawaal hai? Wo bilkul mujhe support nahi kar rahi hai ya kuch bhi aisa. Haan, Bhagwan hi jaane, shayad ye behtar hai."
42,"Well, are there any disadvantages to living with your parents?",routine,149_42,T,irq,0.0,"Kya re, apne maa-baap ke saath rehne mein koi nuksaan toh nahi hai na?"
43,"living with my parents at my age, it just feels like a little bit humiliating a lot humiliating. ",symp/reasoning,149_43,P,id,-3.0,"Meri age mein apne parents ke saath rehna, yeh sirf thoda sa apmaanjanak lagta hai, bahut hi apmaanjanak lagta hai."

45,"Yeah, just this feeling of failure, embarrassment and then my mom just is in my business.",symp/reasoning,149_45,P,gc,-3.0,"Haan, bas yeh ek aisi feeling hai, jaise haar, sharm aur fir meri maa bas meri life mein poke karti rehti hai."
46,So some clear disadvantages to move into Paris any advantages other than the obvious who would separate you from the  Adderall?,routine,149_46,T,crq,0.0,"Toh kuch saaf nuksan hai Paris mein shift karne ki, par kya hai koi fayda jisse apko Adderall se alag kiya ja sake?"

51,Uh huh.,inactive,149_51,P,gc,0.0,Haan ji.
52,"So there's some disadvantages to this plan, but there's some advantages. And there's a key advantage of being think of narrow.",routine,149_52,T,crq,0.0,"Toh kuchh nuksaan is yojana ke hain, lekin kuchh fayde bhi hain. Aur yahan ek mahatvapurna fayda hai ki ikhtiyaar ki aaruvein sochna."
53,"Yeah. And it wouldn't necessarily have to be the rest of my life either. Just for now, just to get me out of that apartment with the Drug. Right ?",symp/reasoning,149_53,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan. Aur yeh zaroori nahi ki meri poori zindagi ke liye hi ho. Abhi bas, mujhe us daire ke bahar nikalne ke liye. Sahi na?"
54,That would separate you from the drug and you could potentially move out later on.,routine,149_54,T,gc,0.0,Wo aapko nasha se alag kar dega aur aap baad mein vapas bhi ja sakte hai.
55,"Oh my god, do I want to I mean, that that's just it.

Jaise ke, yeh toh bahut accha lagta hai jab tak main sach mein uske baare mein sochti nahi."
56,"When you really think about it, what comes to mind?",routine,149_56,T,irq,0.0,"Jab aap sach me sochte hain, toh dimaag me kya aata hai?"
57,"Oh, like I start to shake like that feeling of, you know, when you really want something, you really want something and you can't get to it. And that desperation that I'm like, right now, I know that, you know, I'm living there, it could be my choice. I could take it, or I could not take it. You know, but at least when I want it, it's there. If I move out, I'm like making that decision for myself.

Tab meri haalat bohot hi bechain hoti hai, aur main jaanti hun ki meri zindagi mein yeh khud hi mera faisla hoga. Main choose kar sakti hun ki main ise le lun ya na le lun.
