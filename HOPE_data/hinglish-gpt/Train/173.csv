3,"Um, things you know, I've been really sort of preoccupied and anxious a lot this week. My daughter got sick. So I had to take three days off of work to take care of her and I'm starting to worry, she's been sick a lot since I've gone back to work she's in daycare. And I've had to take a lot of time off work and I'm getting close to going over my allotted amount of days. And so I'm finding myself being very anxious about that and then feeling guilty because when I'm trying to take care of her, I'm always worrying about work so, ",symp/reasoning,173_3,P,id,-1.0,"Arre, kuch cheezein toh tum samajhte ho, main is hafte bohot pareshaan aur chinta mein thi. Meri beti bimaar ho gayi thi.

Aur maine kaafi dino tak chutti li hai kaam se aur ab mera regular kitne din tak ki chutti hai usse jyada ho raha hai. Isliye main apne aap ko bohot chinta mein paati hoon aur fir gunaahgaar bhi mehsoos karti hoon kyunki jab main uski dekhbaal karne ki koshish karti hoon, tab bhi kaam ki chinta rehti hai mere mann mein."

11,"well, because she's been sort of sick a lot lately, I was a little bit worried. And I was sort of, you know, I have this number 10 because I only have 10 days for the whole year. So I had this number in my head and I just thought, Okay, well, there's one more day I got to take away from that 10 that I have, and but I was able to sort of think about, I was a little worried about any work that I would miss, you know, keeping up with my caseload and stuff at work, so, but I was able to kind of figure out that I would be okay for a day and I can kind of make up for that when I get get back.",symp/reasoning,173_11,P,gc,0.0,"लगता है क्योंकि वह हाल ही में बहुत बीमार थी, इसलिए मैं थोड़ा चिंतित थी। और मेरे दिमाग में इस दस दिन का नंबर था क्योंकि मुझे साल के सारे दिनों में सिर्फ १० दिन ही थे। इसलिए मैंने सोचा, ठीक है, मेरे पास उस १० दिन से एक दिन और हो गया है, लेकिन मुझे थोड़ा चिंता थी कि क्या मैं अपनी बाकी क़ामियाबी की लिस्ट को पूरा कर सकूंगी, आपने काम पर ध्यान रखना तो पड़ेगा। लेकिन मैंने सोचा कि मैं एक दिन के लिए ठीक हो जाऊंगी और जब वापस आऊंगी तो इसे पूरा कर सकूंगी।"

17,"and I got a little bit more worried and then I did start to also, you know, add the worry of I was going to start to get behind at work. Not only was I missing more time, but I was also going to be behind on my work. So then I started thinking, when I go back, it's going to be a mad scramble and kind of catch up and keep up with everything. And you know, so it was going to became worrying about my workload and worrying about taking more time. ",symp/reasoning,173_17,P,id,-1.0,"Aur main thoda sa aur pareshaan ho gaya aur phir maine bhi sochna shuru ki main kaam par peeche rehne laga hoon.

19,"I was then it was just more amplified, you know, amplified worry, and it was a lot harder for me to let it go. I just kept thinking I kept going back to it. And then I started feeling guilty. Because I was so preoccupied worried about that. And I was trying to answer emails and do some stuff and send out some emails to people that I work with to try to help me out with things at work since I wasn't there. And then I felt guilty because I wasn't really caring for my child as best as I felt I should have been, you know, I started feeling kinda like a bad mom.",symp/reasoning,173_19,P,id,-1.0,"Main tab fir ekdum zyada jyada seva hui, tujhe yaad hai, kabhi worry tha aur abhi saari problem aur bhi badh gayi thi. Main sab koshish karta raha ki jaane do lekin phir vapis iska socha. Aur fir mujhe kasoor mehsoos hua. Kyunki main itni fikra aur tension mein thi uske baare mein. Main emails ka jawab dene ki koshish kar raha tha aur kuch kaam bhi kar raha tha aur aise logon ko emails bhej raha tha jinke saath main kaam karta tha taaki wo mere kaam mein meri madad kar sake kyunki main wahan nahi tha. Fir mujhe kasoor mehsoos hua kyunki main apne bachche ki tarah ache se dekh bhal nahi kar raha tha, yaani main ek buri maa ki tarah mehsoos karne lagi."

But you know, I've done the best I can to try to make other arrangements but my, you know, just starting back in, starting in daycare, she's just been sick a lot, and I can't control it. I'm doing the best I can. You know, I asked them if there was anything I needed to do as far as providing doctor's notes and stuff. And they said no, that they you know, they don't need a doctor's note since it was my daughter that was sick.

I can't imagine I'm the first mom that has had to deal with this. And they kind of talked like It's never happened before.

Mai soch nahi sakti ki main pehli ma hu jo iske saath deal karna padha. Aur unhone baat ki jaise ki kabhi pehle aisa kabhi hua nahi hai. Isliye main thodi pareshaan ho gayi, kyunki main soch rahi thi ki kya main sach mein pehli ma hu jisne apne bache ke liye zyada se zyada waqt chhodna pada hai.
