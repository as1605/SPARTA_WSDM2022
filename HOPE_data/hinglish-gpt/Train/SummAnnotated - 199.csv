0,"Well, that's the housekeeping finish with Kathleen. So perhaps you'd like to tell me a bit about what brings you here today?",symp/reasoning,199_0,T,irq,,"Well, us 'housekeeping' se hui hai Kathleen ki baat. Toh shayad tum mujhe bata sakte ho ki aaj tum yaha kyu aaye ho?"
1,"Well, actually, Wendy, I'm having a lot of trouble coping with with my job. The hours are working are supposed to be 830 to 330. And lately, I've just got so much work given to me. I'm having difficulty getting through the whole day with it. And I've got a couple of teenage boys that I pick up after school every day because he's so naughty. They're not allowed to go on the bus. And so I've made my hours 830 to 330. So I give them a chance to Get out of school and then at 330 on on supposed to be there to pick them up. But lately, it's been later and later on getting there sometimes 430 the other day was five and the boys were just the naughty boys you notice and and they're everywhere. They're all over the school they're getting into trouble and and then I'm late home preparing dinner for my husband and then he gets annoyed and on it goes, it's getting too much. ",symp/reasoning,199_1,P,id,,"Acha, Wendy, mujhe meri naukri ke saath bahut takleef aa rahi hai. Meri kaamkarne ki samay 830 baje se 330 baje tak hai. Par haal mein, mujhe bahut kaam diya jaa raha hai. Mujhe din bhar mein isse nipatne mein dikkat ho rahi hai. Aur mere paas teen kishor ladke hain, jinhein har din school se uthakar leke jaana padta hai kyunki woh bahut shaitaan hai. Unhein bus mein jaane ki anumati nahi hai. Isliye maine apna samay 830 baje se 330 baje tak kar diya hai, jisse unhein school se nikalne aur phir 330 baje tak mere paas pahunchoo ek mauka mil jaaye. Par haal hi mein, main late aa rahi hoon aur kabhi kabhi 430 baje tak pahunch jati hoon. Ek aur din 5 baje pahuhch gayi thi aur ladke hain, woh toh shaitaan hi hain. School ke har kone mein unhein dekh sakte ho, woh musibat mein padhte hain aur phir main der se ghar pahunchti hoon aur apne husband ke liye dinner tayyar karne mein late ho jaati hoon aur phir unhein gussa aata hai aur yeh chalta rehta hai, ab yeh sab bahut jyada ho raha hai."
2,So you're supposed to finish at 330 Why do you think you're not finishing it through 330?,symp/reasoning,199_2,T,irq,,"Tumhein 330 par khatam karna hai, fir bhi kyun lagta hai ki tum use 330 tak nahi khatam kar rahe ho?"
3,too much work? And here's what's happening. We'll we'll do one dog work in a doctor's surgery. I don't know if I mentioned that. One doctor employed me but there are four within the practice. And I'm doing work for all of them when really I should only be doing work for one,symp/reasoning,199_3,P,id,,Kaafi zyada kaam? Aur ye kya ho raha hai. Hum ek kutte ki tarah ek doctor ki clinic me kaam karenge. Main ye toh nahi pata ki maine pehle se bataya ki ek doctor ne mujhe kaam pe rakha hai par clinic me chaar hain. Aur main sabke liye kaam kar raha hu jabki main ek ke liye hi kaam karna chahiye.
4,"right, So that's really the problem that we'll get You work and there's no way you can fit into the the times that you were employed to work. ",symp/reasoning,199_4,T,id,,"हां , उसलिए यह वास्तव में उस समस्या है कि हम तुम्हें काम करने का काम मिलता है और तुम उस समय के अनुरूप समय में नहीं आ सकते जब तुम नियोज"
5,"No. And I just can't say no to them, but they put the they put the work in my in tray. And then and then it's not get into my head try and write those fallen. It's there the next day in. And it's It's just all too much for us. ",routine,199_5,P,on,,"Na. Aur main bas unse no nahi bol sakti, magar woh meri in-tray mein kaam daalte hain. Aur phir meri dimaag mein bhi naahi jaata try karke woh kaam likhna. Woh agli din bhi wahi rehta hai. Aur yeh sab humare liye bohot zyada hai."
6,I can see that I can see you're getting quite stressed about it. So have you had any thoughts about anything you might be able to do about this? Kathleen? Is there anything you think you could do?,routine,199_6,T,yq,,Main dekhsa hun ki tu dekhra hai ki tu bahut zyada pareshan ho raha hai. Toh koi khayal aya hai tere dimaagh mein? Kathleen? Kya tereko lagta hai tu kuch kar sakta hai?
7,"Well, apart from just I don't I don't believe it's such a good job, but I'll probably have to, I'll have to, I'll have to tell some. I'll have to tell her. I think I'm gonna have to tell her ",symp/reasoning,199_7,P,id,,"Achha, chhodke sirf main yeh nahi maanta ki yeh ek accha kaam hai, lekin shayad mujhe karna padega, mujhe karna hoga, mujhe kuchh batana padega. Mujhe use ko batana padega. Main soch raha hoon ki mujhe use ko batana padega."
8,so you really do feel that you need to talk to the boss that includes you and explain what the problem is. Is this something you feel comfortable about doing?,symp/reasoning,199_8,T,yq,,Kya tum sach mein samajhte ho ki tumhe boss se baat karni chahiye jo tumhe shamil karta hai aur samasya kya hai ye batana hai. Kya tumhe isse karne mein aaraam hai?
9,"No, no, no, no. Oh, she's easy and And she is lovely and I just thought I don't I don't want to annoy her. ",symp/reasoning,199_9,P,on,,"Nahi, nahi, nahi, nahi. Oh, woh sasti hai aur woh pyaari hai aur mujhe laga ki main usse pareshan nahi karna chahta."
10,"Okay, because she was lovely there. She says, Do you think that if you were able to go and talk to her, that she'd actually be quite receptive to listening to you?",routine,199_10,T,yq,,"Thik hai, kyunki wo wahan bahut pyaari thi. Wo bolti hai, Kya tum sochte ho ki agar tum jaake usse baat kar sakte toh wo tumhari baat ko sunne ke liye kaafi taiyaar hogi?"
11,"Well, of course she, wouldn't she",routine,199_11,P,id,,"Are bhai, of course woh bhi karegi na"
12,"okay. What I'm going to suggest Kathleen is that we do something called a role play. And what that is, is that we act out the situation, whatever it is. And in your case, it's going to be you going and talking to your boss and trying to explain to her that you've got a problem trying to fit your work into the house, which is supposed to be working. So you'll be playing, you end up playing your boss. Now, obviously, you're not going to get exactly the same responses from your boss that you'll get from me today. But it does give you a chance to think about the way you might approach it, to practice it, and to get a response that you can then react to and practice your way through a possible scenario. And what this could do happily Give you a bit more confidence about the swing. ",routine,199_12,T,id,,"Theek hai. Main jo bhi Kathleen ko sujhane ja raha hoon voh yeh hai ki hum kuch role play kar sakte hain. Aur yeh kya hai, hum woh situation nibhate hain, jaisa bhi ho. Aur aapke case mein, aapko apne boss se baat karke samjhana padega ki aapke paas ek problem hai jahan aap work ko ghar mein manage karne ki koshish kar rahe hain, jo ki kaam ke liye supposed to hai. Toh aap apne boss ki tarah khud ko play karenge. Ab zaahir si baat hai ki aapko aaj mujhse milne se apne boss ki tarah ekdum same response nahi milega. Lekin yeh aapko mauka deta hai sochne ka ki aap kaise approach kar sakte hain, usko practice karne ka aur ek response paane ka jiske baad aap react kar sakte hain aur ek possible scenario ko practice kar sakte hain. Aur yeh apko khushi se ek bit zyada confidence de sakta hai swing ke baare mein."
13,What do you put in a?,routine,199_13,P,irq,,Aap put a me kya rakhte ho?
14,"Well, we practice it right now. Oh, I can, what we'll do is, you'll be you. And I'll be the doctor that you're going to see. Let's just think about a couple of things to get it started.",routine,199_14,T,id,,"Lekin abhi hum ise practice karenge. Arre, main toh kar sakti hoon, hum jo karenge woh tum ho. Aur main woh doctor rahungi jo tumse milne jaoge. Chalo, shuruat karne ke liye kuch baatein soch lete hain."
15,"So I pretend that I'm going to be coming into her tutorial. Okay, ",routine,199_15,P,id,,Main tumhe pretend karti hoon ki main unki tutorial mein aa rahi hoon. Thik hai.
16,"well, what do you think would be the best time of day to do it? Oh, topic day",routine,199_16,T,irq,,"""Well, kya tumhe lagta hai ki use karne ka sabse accha samay kaun sa ho sakta hai? Oh, topic day"""
17,"time of day. I'm so busy so busy during the day, I'm probably early morning might be the best first first thing in the morning. ",routine,199_17,P,id,,"Din ka waqt. Main itna vyast hoon ki din bhar, shayad subah ki pehli baat subah mein sabse behtar ho."
18,Sounds like a good idea because then you don't have to worry.,routine,199_18,T,id,,Lagta hai acchi salaha hai kyunki tab aapko chinta karne ki zaroorat nahi hai.
19,That's true.,routine,199_19,P,ack,,Vah sacchi hai.
20,"Okay, so have you had any got any thoughts about what you might say? How are you going to introduce?",routine,199_20,T,irq,,"I know, kya tumhe kuch khyal aaya ki tum kya kahoge? Tum kaise introduce kroge?"
21,"I suppose I could say to her, is this a good time to talk? ",routine,199_21,P,id,,"मुझे लगता है कि मैं उसको कह सकता हूँ, क्या अभी बात करने का समय ह"
22,That's fantastic.,inactive,199_22,T,ack,,Wah kya shandar hai
23,Okay,inactive,199_23,P,op,,Okay हो
24,"because that gives her the chance the opportunity to say well, No, it isn't. Could you come in five minutes. I'm sorry. Oh, Go straight into it. That's really good. Okay. Should we give it a try? ",inactive,199_24,T,yq,,"""Kyuki usse mauka milta hai ki woh keh sake, accha nahi hai. Kya aap paanch minute me aa sakte hain. Maafi chaahta hu. Oh, seedhe andar chaliye. Yeh sach me achha hai. Theek hai. Kya hum ek mauka de?"
25,Okay. All right.,inactive,199_25,P,op,,Theek hai. Thik hai.
26,"So I'm gonna get you to stand up and pretend that you knocking on the doors that what you do. Yes, yes. All right. So I want you to get out and just do that and then come back in as if you're having to see your boss and the boss to tell me what to ",routine,199_26,T,id,,"Toh main tumhe utne ko bol raha hu ki tumhara khara hona aur end ko prashna karne jaisa hai. Haan, haan. Theek hai. Toh main chahta hu ki tum bahar niklo aur waise hi karo phir wapas aa jao jaise tumhara boss se milne jana hai aur boss mujhe kya karna hai woh batane ke liye."
27,do the role plays out.,routine,199_27,P,id,,Kya role plays karo.
28,yeah,inactive,199_28,T,ack,,haan
29,Okay. Now good time to talk.,inactive,199_29,P,id,,Thik hai. Ab baat karne ka achcha samay hai.
30,"Yeah, sure. Good, thank you.",inactive,199_30,T,ack,,"Haan, of course. Achha, dhanyavaad."
31,"Well, the problem is Marianne on on having I'm having problems coping with my workload at the moment, mainly because it's putting me here, too late in the afternoon. Remember when you first put me on miles were 830 to 330 as well. No, I'm finishing later and later 430, sometimes 5 I've got too much work and a lot to finish on time because I have to pick them up from school and you know what they like. So I'm just wondering if if we can work well ",symp/reasoning,199_31,P,id,,"Arey yaar, dikat hai, Marianne mujhe pareshan kar rhi hai kyuki main apni workload se cope nhi kar pa rha hu filhaal. Sab iss vajah se ho rha hai kyuki ye mujhe keech rhi hai subha se sham ke baje. Yaad hai jab tumne mujhe pehle miles pe rkh diya tha, wahan bhi 830 se 330 tak ka kaam hota tha. Nhi, ab main late ho rha hu, kabhi 430, kabhi 5 baje tak kaam krna pdta hai. Bohot kaam ho gya hai aur time pe khatam krna hai kyuki unhe school se lene jana padta hai aur tum toh unki pasand jaante ho. Isliye soch rha hu ki hum achhe se kaam kr paenge ya nhi."
32,"obviously you're employed 830 to 330  Kathlleine hours we want you to work so we don't want you working back so first of all, this is important that you know that we want you to leave at 330 and that's what I want you to do. But from what you're saying the work you're being given doesn't fit into those hours",symp/reasoning,199_32,T,id,,"Of course, tum employed ho 830 to 330 Kathlleine ke hours me. Hum chahte hai ki tum kaam karo, par akhir mai yeh jaan lo ki hum tumhe 330 baje chhodna chahte hai aur yahi tumse kahti hu. Lekin jo tum keh rahe ho, jo kaam tumhe diya ja raha hai, wo un hours me fit nahi ho raha hai."
33,I don't know,routine,199_33,P,on,,मला माहित नाह
34,what's happening here I'm getting too much work from the other doctors,routine,199_34,T,id,,Kya ho raha hai yahan? Mujhe dusre doctors se bahut saara kaam mil raha hai.
35,All right i don't know i don't think you're not but I didn't think that I'd be getting work of four because this doctors here and is only doing your work.,symp/reasoning,199_35,P,id,,"Theek hai main nahi jaanta ki main nahi lagta ki tum nahi ho, lekin maine yeh nahi socha tha ki mujhe chaar kaam milega kyunki yahan doctors hain aur woh sirf tumhara kaam kar rahe hain."
36,I think I've got the picture.,routine,199_36,T,od,,Main soch raha hun ki mere pass tasveer hain.
37,I don't I don't like saying no to them though.,symp/reasoning,199_37,P,od,,मुझे पर्याप्त नहीं करना है वे को बैसे में नहीं
38,"I'm glad you came to me. I really need this job. Look. I'm really glad you came to see But obviously 830 to 330 is not enough. It's a long day, early as you're supposed to work. So I need to have a look into this and see what's going on. ",routine,199_38,T,id,,"Main hoon khush ki tum mere paas aaye. Mujhe yeh naukri bohot zaroorat hai. Dekho. Main bohot khush hoon ki tum mere paas aane aaye. Lekin obviously, 830 se 330 tak kaam karna itna aasaan nahi hai. Din bohot lamba hai, aur tumhe jaldi se kaam karna hai. Isliye mujhe isse pehan ke dekhna hoga aur dekhna hoga ki kya ho raha hai."
39,"It's only half my day. The other half starts when I pick my boys up. And they say naughty they are they are really well, certainly",symp/reasoning,199_39,P,id,,यह सिर्फ मेरे दिन का आधा हिस्सा है। दूसरा आधा कुछ भी शुरू होता है जब मैं अपने लड़कों को उठाता हूँ। और जब वे ब
40,"Kathleen. Yes, I'll have a look at it. But I want you to make sure that you do leave at 330 every day.",routine,199_40,T,id,,"Kathleen. Haan, main dekh lungi. Lekin main chahti hu ki tu har roz 330 baje zaroor chale jaana."
41,"Well, I think because I've done that little rolle play feel a little bit better probably gone and seen the doctor will  help",routine,199_41,P,id,,"Achha, mujhe lagta hai kyunki maine wo chhota sa rolle play kiya hai toh mujhe thoda sa acha lag raha hai, shayad main doctor ko milne gaya toh madad karega."
42,"Obviously the responses that I gave are not going to be the ones you'll get from doctor because she is sure this is what she said she. So there'll be something similar, but the important thing is, I think, to work out that first opening gambit, isn't it and it's true and to do that, and then flow on so That's something I want you to think about. Perhaps a few. You guys come and see me next week and about a week perhaps.",routine,199_42,T,ack,,"Obviously mujhe pata hai ki jis jawaab maine diye hain woh aapko doctor se miley hue alag honge kyun ki woh sure hai ki yeh wahi hai jo usne kaha hai. Toh kuchh similar hi hoga lekin important baat yeh hai, mujhe lagta hai, ki pehla opening gambit bahut zaroori hai, na? Aur woh sach hai, uske baad aagey jaana hai, iske liye aur phir yeh bhi ki haan, yeh sochiye, yeh karna hai, aur phir flow on, toh yeh main aapse chahta hoon ki aap yeh soche. Shayaad thoda aur. Aap log next week aao mujhse milne aur lagbhag ek hafte baad."
43,I have to sit home.,routine,199_43,P,id,,Mujhe ghar par baithna padega.
44,"Well, let's look at it. What I'd like you to do is think about what we've done today. Yes, but but don't don't. Don't overdo it don't sort of keep it down for your mind. Well, exactly. That's what I was going to say. I can see that you're getting a bit, too.",routine,199_44,T,id,,"Well, let's dekho at it. Mera khayal hai ki hum aaj kya kiya hai, uspe sochein. Haan, lekin lekin mat karo. Mind ke liye itna zyada na karo ki uspe neeche kar dein. Thik hai. Yehi main bolne waala tha. Mujhe dikhai deta hai ki tum thoda zyada ho rahi ho."
45,I don't like confrontation. I don't like telling people what to do.,routine,199_45,P,od,,Mujhe jhagda pasand nahi hai. Main logo ko bolna pasand nahi karta.
46,"I know. Yeah. So having the right words is a help. That will help you to get a bit of confidence there. But importantly, I think we need to relax a bit, don't we? And there are some very simple relaxation exercises that I can teach you that I'd like you to go away and practice. So that horrified by next week when you come, you'll practice those relaxation exercises, because they have things that you can use anyway in any situation. I'll tell you what I know you don't have to lie on the floor. Not for these because that's not very practical before you go see your boss. So, what I suggest is we look at you coming back in a week's time and your practice the relaxation exercises, we'll go through them again, and we perhaps do another role play and then maybe we might be ready to go and do it for real. What do you think? ",routine,199_46,T,id,,"Main jaanta hoon. Yeah. Toh sahi shabdo ka apna hona ek madad hai. Woh tumko thoda sa confidence dene mein madad karega. Lekin zaroori nahi hai, mujhe lagta hai ki hume thoda-shoda relax hona chahiye, right? Aur mere paas kuch bahut hi simple relaxation exercises hai jise main tumhe sikhana chahta hoon aur main tumse kahunga ki tum jaake practice bhi karo. Taki agle hafte jab tum wapas aao, tum practice kar payo in relaxation exercises ko, kyunki inme kuch aisi cheeze hai jo tum kisi bhi situation mein use kar sakte ho. Main tumhe bata doon mujhe pata hai ki tumko zameen par letna nahi pasand. Ye exercises ke liye kuch aise hai jahaan par tumhe zameen par nahin sona padega. Kyunki boss se milne se pehle practical nahi hai. Isliye, yahaan par main tumse yahi sauggest karta hoon ki ham ek hafta baad milte hai aur tum practice karo in relaxation exercises ko, phir hum dobara se unhe discuss karenge, aur shayad ek aur role play bhi karenge, aur phir shayad hum tayaar ho jayenge aur real life situation mein koshish karenge. Kya tum sochte ho?"
47,"Okay, that's that sounds good. I feel a little bit more relaxed just thinking about that actually.",symp/reasoning,199_47,P,id,,"Thik hoga, vah achchha lag raha h. Mai uske baare mein sochkar thoda shaant hokar feel karti hu."
48,summary,"One doctor employed patient but there are four within the practice . I just can't say no to them, but they put the they put the work in my in tray . It's just all too much for patient. therapist suggest patient to relax a bit. and tells some relaxation exercises. ",,,,,
