10,How long ago was that?,routine,32_10,T,irq,,वह कितने समय पहले था?
11,"was about a month and a half ago? Yeah, all the my friends in the house turned against me because I couldn't pay rent. And it would have been like, the third month but like not consecutively, so I don't see the big issue. Um, and so they told me that if I didn't get out, they would call the police.

20,What was the last time,routine,32_20,T,irq,,Kab tha uss baar?
21,"probably when I was in high school well but yeah when I was still in that like violent stage in my life where I would fight but I never went to anything like out kill this person. It was always just you know, I'll knock you out, but I won't kill you.",story,32_21,P,id,,"Shayad jab main high school mein thi tab thoda violent stage tha mera par haan jab main uss stage par tha jab main ladai karta tha par main kisi ko maarne nahi jaata tha.

24,like the suicidal thoughts if thoughts of harming others do come up would you tell me about those?,routine,32_24,T,irq,,"Kya aap mujhe bata sakte ho, agar dusro ko nuksaan pahuchane ki baatein bhi aati hain toh?"
25,"Oh yeah, I don't want to go jail over hurting somebody. So I tell you ",routine,32_25,P,id,,"Arre haan, This is my Hindi (Hinglish) way - ""Oh haan, main kisi ko chot ya dard nahi dena ke karan jaaish se baachna chahta hu. Toh main aapko bata deta hu."""

Nobody's nobody's there. think somebody in the house when there's nobody in the house?,symp/reasoning,32_29,P,irq,,"Achha jab mai cocaine karne jaata tha, kabhi kabhi mujhe aisa lagta tha ki koi darwaze pe hai lekin wo wahaan nahi hai. Koi nahi hai. Kya ghar me kisiko hone ka lagta hai jab ghar me koi nahi hai?"
