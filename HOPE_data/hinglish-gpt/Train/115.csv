0,"Okay, Felicity, before we start to talk about what you've come here to see me for today, I just wanted to raise an issue with you. I think we both realized when you walked in here that we've seen each other before. ",story,115_0,T,id,,"Thik hai, Felicity, aane se pehle hame baat karni thi ki aap aaj mujhe kya dikhane ke liye yaha aaye hai, maine bas aapko ek baat batani thi. Mujhe lagta hai ki hum dono ne pehle bhi ek-doosre ko dekha hai jab aap yaha aaye."
1,"Yeah, I'm Jake's mom. I've seen you at kindy. ",inactive,115_1,P,ack,,"Haan, main Jake ki maa hoon. Mene tumhe kindy mein dekha hai."
2,"That's right. That's right. We do run into each other, a fair bit at the kindergarten. So I suppose what that brings up for me is that I'm a psychologist, and there is certain boundaries that I have to uphold with my clients. And I think that we need to talk about what we're going to do about this, that we we do see each other quite often and how we're going to manage that in terms of, you know, keeping those appropriate boundaries within therapy and outside the therapy room.",story,115_2,T,id,,"Yeh sahi hai. Yeh sahi hai. Hum ek doosre se bahut kuch milte hain, kindergarten mein. Toh mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe is baat ka dhyan rakhna chahiye ki main ek psychologist hoon, aur mere clients ke saath kuch seemaayein hai. Aur main sochta hoon ki humein is baare mein baat karni hogi ki hum is baat ka kyaa karenge, ki hum bahut baar ek doosre se milte hain aur hum iske management mein kaise honge, therapy ke andar aur bahar seemaayein banaye rakhte hue."
3,Okay. Yeah.,inactive,115_3,P,ack,,Thik hai. Haan.
4," So how I say this, we have a few different options. The first one is that we could decide not to engage in therapy together. Given that, you know, there could be some issues when we see each other outside of therapy. Okay, how would that option sit for you? ",story,115_4,T,irq,,"Toh mein yeh bolta hu, humare paas kuch alag vikalp hai. Pehla vikalp yeh hai ki hum saath mein teraapi mein shaamil nahi ho sakte. Yeh jaankar ki hum dono ko hi therapy ke bahar milne mein kuch masle ho sakte hain. Theek hai, tere liye yeh vikalp kaisa hai?"
5,"Well, um, I guess, part of the problem for me is that I really, I feel that I really need to talk to someone about what's going on for me and I don't really, there's no one else in town I can talk to okay. ",symp/reasoning,115_5,P,id,,"Achha, um, I suppose, part of the problem for me is that I really, mujhe lagta hai ki main sach mein kisi se baat karna chahta hoon jo mere liye ho raha hai aur main sach mein, yahaan koi aur hai nahi jiske saath main baat kar sakoon theek hai."
6,"Yeah, psycho psychology services are quite limited in this area. Yeah. Okay. So you really feel that you need the help and this is the only option that you've got. So given that that's the case. How do you think we could manage this one we do run into each other outside of the therapy rooms so that we don't cross over you know, the boundaries of therapists and clients. So if I see you at the kindergarten shall we acknowledge each other and you know, keep walking or how would you like to manage it? ",story,115_6,T,irq,,"Haan, psycho psychology services bohot kam restricted hai iss area mein. Haan. Thik hai. Toh tum sach mein feel karate ho ki tumhe help ki zaroorat hai aur yehi ek option hai jo tumhe mila hai. Toh jab yeh situation hoti hai. Tum yeh sochte ho ki hum iss situation ko kaise manage kar sakte hai jab hum therapy rooms ke bahar mile toh taaki therapist aur client ke beech koi pehlu na pade. Toh agar main tumhe kindergarten mein dekhun toh kya hum each other ko acknowledge karenge aur chalte jayenge ya kaise manage karna pasand karoge?"
7,"No, I mean, I think I think it's good if you know if we can, like say hi and stuff, but I mean, I probably Probably wouldn't want to talk to you at kindy about what we do here in case other people hear it.",story,115_7,P,id,,"Nahi, mujhe yaad nahi hai lekin, mujhe lagta hai ki agar hum kar sakte hain, jaise hello bolte hue aur aise cheezein, lekin main sochta hu ki main shayad tumse kinni mein hum yahan kya karte hain ke bare mein baat nahi karna chahunga kyunki dusre logon ko sunai de sakta hai."
8,"Sure, sure. And I'm really glad that you brought that point up, because I think that, given that we will run into each other quite a bit at the kindergarten, it's fine for us to acknowledge each other, but we do need to keep the therapeutic issues that we talk here in therapy for therapy. Yeah, yeah. I'm glad that you think that it that would not be appropriate. ",routine,115_8,T,id,,"ठीक है, ठीक है। और मुझे बहुत खुशी है कि आपने उस बिंदु को उठाया है, क्योंकि मुझे लगता है कि, हम जब भी बालवाड़ी में आमंत्रित होंगे, तो हमें एक दूसरे का स्वीकार करना ठीक है, लेकिन हमें चिकित्सा के मुद्दों को चिकित्सा के लिए चर्चा करनी होगी। हा, हा। मुझे खुशी है कि आपको लगता है कि वह उचित नहीं होगा।"
9,"Yeah. Yeah.  And I mean, you wouldn't, you wouldn't tell anybody other moms, would you?",inactive,115_9,P,irq,,"Haan. Haan. Aur main matalab, aap kisi aur maa ko nahi batayenge, na?"
10,"No, no, I'm, I would definitely keep it confidential, that we're in a therapeutic relationship together. Nobody else needs to yet be aware of that. Okay. ",story,115_10,T,id,,"Nahi, main, main zaroor uska gupt rakhunga, ki hum saath mein ek chikitsa prakriya mein hain. Kisi aur ko abhi tak is baat ka pata hona zaroori nahi hai. Theek hai."
11,"So it's kind of like, we've got therapy for in here, but then out there. We're just mums. ",inactive,115_11,P,id,,"Toh aisa hai ki yahan par humein therapy milta hai, lekin wahan bahar. Hum bas ma hai."
12,"That's exactly right. So if we could just keep it at you know, those things separate then I don't think we should run into any problems in therapy. Yeah, but perhaps we could check in from time to time to see you know, whether that It's becoming a problem for ",story,115_12,T,ack,,"Yeh bilkul sahi hai. Toh agar hum sirf aapko pata hone waale cheezon ko alag rakh sake, toh main nahi lagta hai ki hum therapy mein kisi bhi mushkil se natakhatakna padega. Haan, lekin shayad hum samay-samay par aap se check karle toh dekhein, ki kya yeh ek samasya ban rahi hai."
13,"Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.",inactive,115_13,P,ack,,"Haan, haan. Thik hai. Haan, woh theek lagta hai."
14," Do you think that sounds okay? Yep. All right. So now that we've discussed that issue, yeah. Let's talk about why you've come in to talk to me today. ",story,115_14,T,id,,"kya lagta hai ki theek hai? haan. thik hai. toh ab jab humne us mudde ke baare mein baat ki, haan. chalo hum baat karte hain ki tumne aaj mujhse baat karne ke liye kya kiya hai."
15,Okay.,,115_15,P,ack,,Thik hai
