28,Do you feel like this time would be different?,symp/reasoning,168_28,T,orq,0.0,Kya tumhe lagta hai ki yeh baar alag hoga?
29,"Well, I feel like in the past, you know, I've I've been thinking about killing myself seriously, but now, I'm not as scared of it. So I don't really want you to put me in the hospital because then I won't be able to do it. And before I was scared, so I wanted you to put me in the hospital. But now I just want to get it over with and so I really don't want you to do that.",story,168_29,P,od,-1.0,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki pehle, pata hai, main serious taur par apne aap ko maarna ke baare mein soch raha tha, lekin ab, mujhe usse utni darr nahi lagti.

When somebody thinks they found a solution to depression, even if that solution something that I am against, like suicide, that their their mood would become elevated because you see an end to pain.

Aap sach mein sirf sabse andheri side dekh rahe hain jab aap isme hain."
39,"Yeah, but I'm feeling better now.",symp/reasoning,168_39,P,id,-1.0,"Haan, par main ab thoda behtar mehsoos kar raha hoon."

And we've talked about how devastating that would be to your family, right? your friends.",symp/reasoning,168_40,T,gc,0.0,"Adhiktamaka, kyonki tumhein lagta hai ki tumne dard ki ant tak pahunch liya hai jise main samajhta hoon.

43,Yeah. And feels like the right thing to do,symp/reasoning,168_43,P,ack,1.0,Haan. Aur aisa lagta hai ki yeh sahi cheez hai karne ke liye.
44,"And as you know, I mean, you've signed releases, I've talked to your husband, your parents, they've repeatedly said that, despite sometimes the challenge of dealing with depression, they would much rather Have you alive, Why would they say that?",symp/reasoning,168_44,T,gc,0.0,"Aur jaisa ki tum jaante ho, matlab, tumne releases sign kiye hain, maine tumhare pati se baat ki hai, tumhare mata-pita se bhi baat ki hai, ve baar baar yeh keh chuke hain ki, depression ka samna karne mein kuch mushkil bhi ho, lekin ve tumhe zinda dekhna pasand karenge, Ve aisa kyun kahenge?"

52,And I would hope that I've earned your trust and you value my opinion. We'll do something that I know about suicide. You open  to hearing it?,symp/reasoning,168_52,T,gc,0.0,Aur main ummeed karta hun ki maine aapki bharose ka haq hasil kiya hai aur aap meri rai ki kadar karte hain.

53,Yeah,symp/reasoning,168_53,P,op,-1.0,Haan
54,"There's a lot of ways that people die. Right. And it's, it's really what eventually will happen to us all. It's hard for me to imagine way more devastating than suicide. Meaning when somebody dies of an illness, or a car accident or any other type of tragic accident, people grieve, right? But there's usually not a blame assigned to that mean they don't feel guilty. Does that make sense? ",symp/reasoning,168_54,T,gc,0.0,"Logically so, there are many ways of dying. Isn't it? Eventually, this is what will happen to all of us. For me, thinking of a fate worse than suicide is difficult. In case someone passes away due to an illness, a car accident, or any other unfortunate event, people experience sorrow, correct? However, they don't feel responsible or at fault. Do you understand what I mean?"
55,Yeah,symp/reasoning,168_55,P,ack,0.0,Haan
56,"They feel sad because they've lost the person, but they don't feel responsible for that person's death.

They could never get an answer.",symp/reasoning,168_56,T,gc,0.0,"उन्हें दुख महसूस होता है क्योंकि वे उस व्यक्ति को खो चुके हैं, लेकिन उन्हें उस व्यक्ति की मौत के लिए जिम्मेदार नहीं लगता है। आत्महत्या अलग होती है, जब कोई आत्महत्या करता है, तो उनके परिवार और दोस्त ज़िम्मेदार महस"

59,"No, but I think that it will help them realize that they shouldn't feel guilty, like you're saying",symp/reasoning,168_59,P,od,-1.0,"Nahi, par main sochta hu ki yeh unko samajhne mein madad karega ki woh apne aapko gunahgaar mehsoos na karein, jaise tum keh rahe ho."

61,Yeah.,symp/reasoning,168_61,P,cd,0.0,Aree h
62,"Okay. I can tell you from experience that notes, notes don't really help. If anything, it's another artifact that they can agonize over. I know it's hard to see from your perspective, because you're kind of resolved to this and you feel stuck in the pain you want now, but they will miss you and they will agonize for the rest of their lives, because they've lost you. And it's a it's a special horrible type of agony that comes with feeling responsible for causing someone's death. I know you don't want that.",symp/reasoning,168_62,T,gc,0.0,"Thik hai. Main tujhe apne anubhav se bata sakta hu ki notes, notes sahi madad nahi karte hain. Bhaavna toh door dur tak nahi hai, baar-baar pareshan karne ka saman hi hai. Main jaanta hu ki tumhare nazarie se dekhne mein mushkil hai, kyunki tum ismein tayyar ho aur abhi tak takleef se atak gaye ho, par woh tumhe yaad karenge aur woh bhi poori zindagi pareshan honge kyunki woh tumhe kho diye hain. Aur yeh ek alag tarah ka dard hota hai jab kisi ki maut ka zimmedar hona pata chalta hai. Main jaanta hu ki tum waisa nahi chahte."
63,I just don't know why you can't let me feel better.,symp/reasoning,168_63,P,gc,-1.0,Main bas yeh hi nahi jaanta ki tum mujhe behtar mehsoos karne kyun nahi de sakte ho.
64,"I know it's frustrating. I know it's hard to understand. The times when you've gone to the hospital before, you have felt better. Your outlook was completely different, not 100%. But it was completely different when you came out. I mean, you're still a little down, but nowhere near the depression we'd want to hurt yourself.

And typically, well, every time right, every time you've been in the hospital, you've come out feeling better. I know it's not what you want to hear. I know you want me to be happy that you're gonna enjoy life, but that would make me happy. That would make anybody happy. I know you think it would make you happy.
