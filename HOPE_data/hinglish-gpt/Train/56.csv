5,I know your brother brought you in today and he had expressed some concerns about your mood. Do you know what that's about?,symp/reasoning,56_5,T,irq,,Mujhe pata hai ki aaj tumhare bhai ne tumhe lekar aaya tha aur unhone tumhare mood ke baare mein kuch chinta jataayi thi. Kya tumhe pata hai ki woh kya hai?
6,"I, I think he's worrying for no reason. Because I, you know, I for the last like week and a half, I have been following my passion, which is baking. And I didn't realize this before, because I worked in an office. And I just realized that that's not what I want to do with my life. And I know what I want to do with my life now, and I've never known before. So this is an amazing feeling. And what I want to do is I want to start my own baking business. And so what happened was That a couple. Two weeks ago, my nephew had a bake sale. And I've always I've always been like baking, but I've always been like from the box or like from, you know, whatever. So I tried for the first time making brownies from scratch and they were amazing and everyone loved them at the bake sale and they sold out. And my nephew thought I was a hero, basically, I was and so now it made me realize like I could do this for a living and it would make me feel amazing and make me feel like a hero for all these people. And like my college campus would be kind of cool if I could like put up something about like delivering the bakery like the dorms or like big goods to dorms because you know, college students love that type of thing. But so anyway, so I was thinking about long story short, having this business and I would bake all these cookies and I was gonna put up flyers because I don't I'm not like at the point where I can get like an office space but I don't need an office space because I have my apartment and I have everything I need in my apartment to bake everything I need. And I can also have a BJs membership. So Go to BJs. And I can get everything I need in bulk. So like all the flour and butter and sugar and all that stuff. So it's not an issue if I just do it from my apartment. And so I was putting up flyers and trying to promote my business and has really been working on for the last week and a half, and I feel great. And it's amazing. And that's basically it.",story,56_6,P,id,,"Mai, mai useko dikhta ho ke woh bejaar hai lekin koi baat nahi. Kyuki main, dekho, main pehle hafte se apne passion ko follow kar rahi hu, jo ki baking hai. Aur pehle mein is baat ko nahi samajhti thi, kyuki main ek office mein kaam karti thi. Lekin ab mujhe yeh pata chala hai ki yeh zindagi kaam nahi hai mere liye. Aur ab mujhe apni zindagi ke baare mein pata hai aur yeh pehle se nahi tha. Yeh ek ajeeb sa ehsaas hai. Aur main jo karna chahti hu, woh yeh hai ki main apna khud ka baking business shuru karu. Aur is baat se thoda pehle, mere bhatije ne ek bake sale ki thi. Aur main hamesha se baking karti aayi hoon, lekin yeh pehle se hi kisi box se ya kisi aur tareeke se karti thi. Toh maine pehli baar brownies banaye the scratch se aur usne sab ko bahut pasand aaye aur woh bik gaye bhi. Aur mere bhatija ko lagta tha ki main ek hero hu, bas wahi hu main. Aur ab mujhe yeh pata chala ki main isko apne career ke taur par bhi kar sakti hu aur yeh mujhe ek amazing feeling dega aur isse mere liye ek hero banega sabke liye. Aur meri college campus pe yeh bhi kaafi cool hoga agar main kuch aesi cheezen kar sakti hu jaise bakery ko dorms tak pahuchana ya fir dorms mein bakery goods deliver kar sakti hu, kyuki college students ko woh bohot pasand hota hai. Lekin waise toh, toh main baat yeh hai ki main apna ek business shuru kar rahi hu aur usmein main bahut saare cookies bake karungi aur maine flyers taiyar kiye the kyuki pehla option toh office space nahi mila par yeh zaroori bhi nahi hai kyuki mere paas meri khud ki apartment hai aur mujhe saari cheezein is baat karne ke liye haasil hai. Aur mujhe ek BJs membership bhi hai, toh main wahan jaati hu aur yeh sare saamaan bulk mein paa leti hu. Jaise ki maida, makhan, cheeni aur sab bhi cheezein. Toh mein apni apartment se hi kar sakti hu aur mujhe koi dikkat nahi hai. Aur mujhe apne business ko promote karne ke liye flyers lagaane the aur main iske liye kaafi mehnat kar rahi hu pehle ke hafte se aur mujhe bahut accha lag raha hai. Yeh ek amazing feeling hai aur yehi sab kuch hai."
7,"Alright, so you feel like, everything's kind of going your way. Hmm. And you're really excited about the new business idea. I know that your brother was a little concerned with how much you've been spending on the business idea. And he mentioned some things about different relationships you've had that are new. ",symp/reasoning,56_7,T,irq,,"Arre, toh tu feel kar raha hai, sab kuch thoda tere tarike se ho raha hai. Hmm. Aur tu naye business idea ke baare mein bohot zyada excited hai. Mujhe pata hai ki tere bhai ko thoda chinta thi ki tu business idea ke liye bohot paise kharch kar raha hai. Aur usne kuch baatein batayi thi jisme tere naye rishte bhi shamil hai."
8,"Okay, so there's a couple that with that. So with the spending, like I don't think my brother recognizes that when you start a business like you need to invest in it to begin, and I understand why he's worried because like, so at work well at the office job that I had, like I got in trouble and because I obviously you need to make fires and I was like, oh, like he doesn't realize I'm frugal. I'm smart. So I was like I'll make the fires at work. And put them out of the work computer. So that I'm not having to pay like, wherever, like staples or something to go and print them out for me. So I got in trouble because it was like for personal use, and I was using like the, the work, whatever. But like that's what annoys me about it because like the new guy that I met, which is the other thing with the relationships, like this new guy is so supportive of my ideas. I met him actually in a bakery, which is like destiny. And he was so supportive when I told him about what I was planning. And actually the other guy that I was talking to before, and I've been talking to him for a while, he was kind of like my brother and was like, are you sure this is something you want to do? And like, I don't understand why you would say that someone who's obviously sure of what they want to do. Like, I know I can do it. I know that I'll be successful, like, did they not taste the brownies at the bake sale? Like they were amazing. And so that's kind of where I am and that's why my brother's worried but he shouldn't be because like I have all this played out.",story,56_8,P,id,,"Okay, so I was thinking that there are a couple of things that need to be taken care of. You see, when you start a business, you need to put in some money initially, and I feel that my brother doesn't understand that. I can understand why he's concerned, since at my previous office job, I had gotten into trouble for using their resources for personal use. I had to make print-outs for work, but I didn't want to pay for them from a store like Staples, so I thought of using the printer at work. But I got caught and reprimanded for it. What annoys me about this is that the new guy I met, who I am also in a relationship with, is very supportive of my ideas. We met at a bakery, which seems like it was fate. He was very encouraging when I shared my business plans with him. On the other hand, the previous guy I was talking to, who has been in my life for a while, was hesitant like my brother and questioned my decisions. I don't understand why people feel the need to doubt someone who is confident and sure about their goals. I know I can do it, and I have tasted success before, especially with my delicious brownies at the bake sale. This is why my brother shouldn't be worried, I have everything planned out."
9,He's worried that you don't want to think this was the new relationship you don't know the guy too well,routine,56_9,T,gc,,"Vo worried hai ki tumhe lagta hai ye nayi rishta hai, lekin tum ladke ko achhe se nahi jante ho."
10,"I mean, I've hooked up with him a few times, like I know him pretty well. And I don't think he understands like the connection that we have, I guess a pretty strong one.",story,56_10,P,id,,"मैं मतलब यह कह रही हूँ, मैंने कुछ बार उसके साथ जुड़ा है, जैसे कि मैं उसे बहुत अच्छी तरह से जानती हूँ। और मुझे लगता है कि वह हमारे बीच का जोड़ समझता ही नहीं है, मानों एक क"
11,"So your brother just doesn't. In your mind, he just doesn't get it.",routine,56_11,T,crq,,"Toh tera bhai bas aisa hi karta hai. Tere dimaag mein, use bilkul samajh nahi aata."
12,"No. And like, he doesn't like, pay attention to me when I talk. Like, I'll be trying to tell him about, like the bake sale and or not the bake sale. Well, a little bit about the bake sale, I can try to tell him about how successful it was. And he just thought that I was like, bragging, but I wasn't like it was genuinely, like a success. And then I tried to tell him about my business idea. And like, he's like, trying to like brush it off. Like it's not a good idea. And that's why so he just doesn't listen to me. So sometimes I try not to talk too much about it.",story,56_12,P,cd,,"Nahi. Aur jaise, woh mujhe, jab main baat kar rahi hu tab dhyaan nahi deta. Jaise, main use batane ki koshish kar rahi hu, bake sale ke baare mein ya nahi bake sale ke baare mein. Thoda sa bake sale ke baare mein, main use bata sakti hu ki kitna successful tha. Par woh bas sochta tha ki main taak rahi hu, par main taak rahi nahi thi, woh sach mein, ek safal bake sale tha. Phir main use apne business idea ke baare mein batane ki koshish ki. Aur jaise, woh ussey thukra raha tha. Jaise woh achha idea nahi hai. Aur isiliye woh mujhe nahi sunta. Isiliye kabhi kabhi main uske baare mein zyada baat nahi karti."
13,"Have you noticed through all this, any change in sleep patterns? ",symp/reasoning,56_13,T,irq,,क्या तुमने इस बात पर ध्यान दिया है कि इस सबमें कोई नींद
14,"I haven't been sleeping as much but I think that's just because I'm so excited about this and like so. I've been like staying up late and waking up early and like looking at recipes, and honestly hasn't really been an issue because I haven't been tired at all. I was really The I haven't eat I felt rested. I get enough.",story,56_14,P,id,,"मैं अब ज्यादा सोने की कोशिश नहीं कर रही हूँ, लेकिन मुझे लगता है कि यह सिर्फ इसलिए है क्योंकि मैं इसके बारे में बहुत उत्साहित हूँ और ऐसा ही होता है। मैं रात को देर से उठती हूँ और सुबह जल्दी से उठती हूँ और रेसिपी देखती हूँ, और सच कहूँ, यह कोई बड़ी दिक्कत नहीं है क्योंकि मैं कभी थकी हुई नहीं होती। मुझे सचमुच"
15,Notice you do feel rested. You haven't been sleeping as much.,routine,56_15,T,yq,,Dhyaan rakho tumhe araam aata hai. Tum itna soyi nahi ho.
16,No,inactive,56_16,P,on,,Nahi
17,"And you clearly seem like you're in a good mood No, no sadness right now at that,",routine,56_17,T,gc,,"Aur aap waise bahut hi khush mizaj nazar aate hain, nahi nahi koi dukh abhi hai usme."
18,like I'm not gonna have sadness when you're following your passion,routine,56_18,P,id,,Main tumhari passion mein tumhare piche nahi khada hoga toh dukh nahi hoga.
19,should be doing pretty well that way. Have you ever been down or depressed?,routine,56_19,T,irq,,वह काफी अच्छा कर रहा होगा। क्या तुम कभी नीचे या उदास हुए हो?
20,"Yeah, yeah. In the past I have been actually, not too long ago, about four months ago I was I was hospitalized because I was so down. But, you know, and I, I don't feel like that now. And I know what it feels like to be down and I don't have any of that stuff. Like I feel so much more hopeful and happy and just great with where my life is going right now.",story,56_20,P,id,,"Arey, arey. Pichle main toh haan, koi chaar mahine pehle main bahut hi neeche tha jis wajah se main hospital mein admit hua tha. Lekin ab nahi, ab mujhe woh feel nahi hota. Mujhe pata hai neeche rehne ka kaisa lagta hai aur ab woh sab mere paas nahi hai. Ab main bahut zyada optimistic aur khushh hoon aur apni zindagi ke layak hon jahaan meri life ab ja rahi hai."
21,"Do you ever feel this way before? kind of in a really good, ",routine,56_21,T,yq,,Kya kabhi pehle se aisa mahsoos kiya hai? Thoda bahut zyaada achcha waala?
22,no,routine,56_22,P,on,,nahi
23,No. Nothing like this.,inactive,56_23,T,crq,,Nahi. Kuch bhi aisa nahi hai.
24,What do you think about all this one?,routine,56_24,T,irq,,Tum is sab ke bare me kya sochti ho?
25,"Honestly I just think it's like getting to know myself and getting to know like what I want to do which is this you know, culinary arts",symp/reasoning,56_25,P,cd,,"Honesty mein toh mujhe lagta hai ki yeh khud ko jaanna hai aur yeh jaanna hai ki mujhe karna kya hai, jo yeh hai, culinary arts."
26,it's kind of realizing that it's kind of changed my life,symp/reasoning,56_26,T,gc,,Ye realize hona hai ki ye meri zindagi mein kuch badal diya hai.
27,for the better for like really for the better,routine,56_27,P,gc,,अच्छे के लिए सच में अच्छे के लिए पसंद करें
28,"All right, and you mentioned before that you got some trouble at work",routine,56_28,T,crq,,"Sab thik, aur aapne pehle hi bataya tha ki aapko kaam mein thodi takleef hui thi."
29,right? How bad that turned out,routine,56_29,T,crq,,Bilkul? Kitna bura hua wo
30,"pretty bad like I it was like a final written notice so if any little thing at this point could make me lose my job but I'm not too worried about it because at this point I'm putting so much time into the baking business that if something goes wrong with my like office job, like I'll have this like in I'm sure that in as short as a month like I'll, I'll be making money soon. And a lot of money because I know how much time I'm going to be putting into this how passionate I am about it. And I know that like I'll be able to make the money back that I've put into it. So I'm not worried about it",story,56_30,P,cd,,"Bahut bure ho gaya hai yaar, ab toh final written notice jaisa lag raha hai. Agar ab kuch bhi chhota sa ho gaya toh mere job ka chance jaa sakta hai, lekin mujhe is baat se zyada fikar nahi hai. Kyunki ab main baking business mein itni time laga rahi hu, ki agar mere office job mein kuch gadbad ho bhi gayi toh main isme aage badh sakti hu. Aur kama bhi sakti hu, shayad ek mahine mein hi. Aur bahut paisa bhi kamaungi, kyunki mujhe pata hai ki main kitna time isme lagaungi aur main isme kitni passionate hu. Aur mujhe yakeen hai ki main apne invest kiye hue paise ko waapas kama lungi. Isiliye mujhe is baat ki chinta nahi hai."
31,shouldn't have to worry about that.,routine,56_31,T,yq,,उस बात को चिंता न करने की जरूर
32,Yeah.,inactive,56_32,P,ack,,Haan.
33,"Any medical conditions, you know, have a drug and alcohol you're saving is anything like that? ",routine,56_33,T,yq,,"Kya aapke paas, koi bhi medical haalat hai jisse aap dawa aur sharaab se bachte hain?"
34,No,routine,56_34,P,on,,Nahi
35,Are you seeing or hearing anything that other people can't see or hear?,routine,56_35,T,yq,,Kya tum kisi cheez ko dekh rahe ya sun rahe ho jo dusre log nahi dekh sakte ya sun sakte?
36,"No, ",routine,56_36,P,on,,"Nahi,"
37,"no like that? Sure. So I know that you're feeling pretty well. But I would like you to see a counselor, maybe help you as you contemplate these different things we've been talking about. If you'd be if you'd be okay with talking to a counselor,",routine,56_37,T,yq,,"Nahin aapko aise pasand nahi? Pakka. Toh mujhe pata hai ki aapka halat kaafi achha hai. Par main chahta hoon ki aap ek counselor se milein, shayad aapki madad kar sake jo baatein ham kar rahe hain. Agar aap counselor se baat karne se raaji honge toh,"
38,I guess that'd be fine.,inactive,56_38,P,ack,,Mujhe lagta hai ki thik ho jaega.
39,You'd be okay with that. I'll get that set up. We'll just take a moment. And I want to thank you for answering my questions. This has been helpful.,inactive,56_39,T,gt,,Tumhe waisa thik lagega. Mein woh set kar lenge. Bas hum ek pal le lenge. Aur mein tumhe mere sawaalon ka jawaab dene ke liye shukriya kehna chata hu. Yeh buhat madadgaar raha hai.
