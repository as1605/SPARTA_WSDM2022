0,"Hello, Peggy, how you doing today?",inactive,85_0,T,gt,,"हैलो, पेगी, तुम आज कैसे हो"
1,"I'm okay,",inactive,85_1,P,gt,,"Main thik hoon,"
2,"you're okay. Glad to hear that. Yesterday, when you're here at the agency, you took a few different tests. Remember that?",inactive,85_2,T,yq,,"आप ठीक हो। ऐसा सुनकर अच्छा लगा। कल, जब आप एजेंसी पर यहाँ थे, आपने कुछ अलग अलग टेस्ट लिए"
3,I did.,inactive,85_3,P,op,,Maine kiya.
4,"One of the tests you took is called the SCL 90, the symptom checklist 90. Do you remember taking that test?",symp/reasoning,85_4,T,yq,,"Kya tumne SCL 90 liya tha, uss parikshan mein se ek hai jo tumne liya tha. Kya tumhe yaad hai uss parikshan ko liye hue?"
5,I think so.,symp/reasoning,85_5,P,gc,,Mujhe lagta hai.
6,It's 90 items. And they are ranked,inactive,85_6,T,id,,90 items hain. Aur woh rank kiye gaye hain.
7,asked me like true and false questions?,inactive,85_7,P,crq,,Kya tumhe mujhse sahi aur galat sawaal poochha gaya?
8,Not true and false are numbers that you solve.,inactive,85_8,T,cd,,नाही आणि खोटे हे अंक आहेत जे तू सोडतो
9," Oh, okay. I do remember that. Okay.",inactive,85_9,P,id,,"Arre, thik hai. Mujhe yaad hai. Thik hai."
10,So I have the results from that test. I want to review some of those findings with you. ,symp/reasoning,85_10,T,id,,Toh maine us test se results paaye hain. Main kuch unn findings ko aapse review karna chahta hoon.
11,Okay. All right. Sure.,inactive,85_11,P,ack,,Theek hai. Thik hai. Zaroor.
12,"So this particular instrument has a number of what we refer to as sub scales. So these are areas that are measured by the instrument, right? For example, depression or anxiety. So I'm going to review a few of these sub scales, ones where you scored a little higher than we might expect. And just review those with you and see. See what you're thinking we can talk about.",story,85_12,T,id,,"Is instrument ka kuch sub scales hote hain, jinko hum refer karte hain. Yeh un areas ko measure karte hain, sahi huna? Maslan, depression ya anxiety. Main kuch sub scales ko review karungi, jahan par aapne jo score kiya hai, wo humare expectations se thoda jyada tha. Aur hum aapke saath unhe review karke dekhte hain, dekhte hain aap kya sochte hain aur hum kya baat kar sakte hain."
13," Okay, are you recording this? ",routine,85_13,P,yq,,"Theek hai, kya aap ise recording kar rahe hain?"
14,No,routine,85_14,T,on,,Naahi.
15,Are very worried about that?,routine,85_15,P,gc,,Kya uss baat ki bahut chinta hai?
16,Is it what makes you think I'm recording?,routine,85_16,T,yq,,Kya yahi hai jo mujhe lagata hai ki main recording kar raha hoon?
17,Because that happens to me a lot.,routine,85_17,P,id,,Kyonki mujhe woh kaafi baar hota hai.
18,It happens to you a lot that you get recorded. ,routine,85_18,T,cd,,Tumhe bahut baar aisa hota hai ki tum record ho jaate ho.
19,I think so. Yeah. Yeah.,routine,85_19,P,ack,,Mujhe lagta hai. Haan. Haan.
20,Remember the last time it happened?,routine,85_20,T,yq,,Yaad rakho wo baar jab yeh ho gaya tha?
21,You probably yesterday,routine,85_21,P,id,,Tum shayad kal
22,And you think you were recorded while you're taking this?,routine,85_22,T,orq,,Aur kya tumhe lagta hai ki tum isko lete huye record kiye gaye the?
23,probably. Yeah.,routine,85_23,P,od,,ho sakta hai. Haan.
24,That sounds worrisome. That's that's a feeling you get a lot that you're being recorded.,routine,85_24,T,crq,,Yeh pareshaani lag raha hai. Yeh ek aisi feeling hai jo aksar ho jaati hai ki tumhe record kiya jaa raha hai.
25,I worry about it a lot.,routine,85_25,P,cd,,Main chinta karta hoon uske baare mein bahut zyada.
26,You worry about it a lot.,routine,85_26,T,cd,,Tum uske baare mein bahut chinta karte ho.
27,"But you know, it's happening. That's why I worry about it.",routine,85_27,P,id,-1.0,"Par tu jaante hai na, yeh ho raha hai. Isiliye main isse chinta karta hoon."
28,You're certain that's happening?,routine,85_28,T,yq,,Kya tumhe yeh ho raha hai?
29,Yeah.,routine,85_29,P,op,,Haan.
30,"Where you're not being recorded now. I know. It probably feels like you are, but you're not. Okay. ",routine,85_30,T,id,,"Abhi tum record nahi ho raha ho. Mujhe pata hai. Shayad tumhe esa lagta hai ki ho, par tum nahi ho. Theek hai."
31,"Okay. But I appreciate you bringing up that concern with me.  I think so in school,",routine,85_31,P,ack,,Okay. Par main tere us concern ko lekar bahut grateful hoon. Mujhe bhi lagta hai ki school me.
32," in school, right? I that would make sense. So, say for instance, you had a percentile rank of 65% Right percentile, that would mean that your score is equal to or higher than 65% of people that took that test. Okay, so that makes sense. So if you took a test on math or English, and you would say 75 percentile, you'd be higher than three quarters of people took the test. 75% Okay, understand? Does that make sense? I think so. Okay. If you want me to come back to that later, just let me know as I go through if it doesn't make sense, okay. So areas here on on the SCL results, or you were a bit higher than we would normally see. A one is the phobic anxiety scale. on that one, you were about 64 percentile. So your score was as high or higher. Than 64% of people who take it ",story,85_32,T,id,,"School mein, haan? Mujhe yeh sahi lagta hai. Toh, maan lo, tumhare percentile rank 65% Right percentile hai, isska matlab hai ki tumhara score 65% logon se barabar ya usse zyada hai jo uss test ko liye hain. Theek hai, yeh sahi hai. Toh agar tum math ya English mein test lete ho, aur tumhare percentile 75% hai, toh tumhara score teeno chaar bhagon wale logon se zyada hoga jo test liye hain. 75% Theek hai, samajh gaye? Yeh sahi hai na? Mujhe lagta hai samajh gaya. Theek hai. Agar tum chahte ho ki main baad mein ispe wapas aao, toh mujhe bata dena jab main aage badhti hun agar yeh samajh mein na aaye, theek hai. Toh SCL ke results par yahaan ghair zaroori areas hain, ya fir thoda zyada area jo normal hota hai. Ek SCL scale ""phobic anxiety"" scale hai. Uss par tumhare percentile kareeb 64 hai. Toh tumhara score 64% logon se barabar ya usse zyada hai jo usse lete hain."
33,"to more than half the people in the population,",routine,85_33,P,crq,,"Adhik se adhik aadmiyon ki aabadi mein adha se jyada logo tak,"
34,more than half the number and half the people in the same situation as you in outpatient mental health treatment.,routine,85_34,T,cd,,"aapki situation jaise hi bahut se log aur bahut se log outpatient mann*si swasth*ya upchar mein, aap se adhikansh sankhya mein hai."
35,So I have more phobic anxiety than most people.,symp/reasoning,85_35,P,crq,-1.0,"Mujhe ekdum zyada dar hai-world se compare kiya toh, jyada se jyada logon ko."
36,It does seem that way. Yeah. So this construct would measure things like being afraid of going out being afraid of being a crowds. Does that connect with you? Is that seem like a fear that you have?,routine,85_36,T,cd,,Yeh lagta hai. Haa. Toh yeh structure logon se milna darrne ki tarah ki cheezen naptega. Kya yeh aapke saath connect karta hai? Kya yeh aap mein ek dar lagta hai?
37,Yeah. Okay.,routine,85_37,P,ack,,Haan. Thik hai.
38,Tell me about that.,routine,85_38,T,irq,,Batao mujhe uske baare mein.
39,"I don't like being on public transportation. Hmm. And crowds make me nervous. If I ever have to public speak, I feel like I'm just going to pass out.",symp/reasoning,85_39,P,id,-2.0,Mujhe public transportation pe hona pasand nahi hai. Hmm. Aur bheed mujhe ghabraati hai. Agar kabhi mujhe public speaking karni pade toh mujhe aisa lagta hai ki main behosh ho jaungi.
40,So it does appear you have kind of phobic anxiety symptoms. So that that score today that 64 percentile. That kind of makes sense.,routine,85_40,T,cd,,Toh aisa lagta hai ki aapke paas kuchh tarah ke phobic ghabrahat ke lakshan hai. Isiliye aaj ka skor 64 percentile hai. Woh thoda sa samajh me aata hai.
41,I kind of get that,routine,85_41,P,ack,,Mujhe iska matlab samajh aata hai
42,"I want to move on to the next one, which is paranoia. On this one, you were at the 84th. percentile. So quite a bit higher.",symp/reasoning,85_42,T,id,,"मुझे अगले आइटम पर आगे बढ़ना है, जो परानोइया है। इस पर, आप 84 वें प्रतिशत पर थे। इसलिए बहुत ज्यादा ऊपर है।"
43,Is that why you were recording me?,routine,85_43,P,yq,,Kya yehi wajah thi ki tum mujhe record kar rahe the?
44,"But this, this wasn't recorded, nothing was recorded here. Understand that's a worry that you have.",routine,85_44,T,id,,"But iss, iss ko record nahi kiya gaya, yahaan kuchh bhi record nahi kiya gaya tha. Samajh lo yeh ek chinta hai jo tumhare paas hai."
45,Are you going to share those results with anybody?,routine,85_45,P,yq,,Kya tum kisi ke saath woh result share karne wale ho?
46,"in your particular case, the only people will be shared with this the rest of the treatment team and anybody that you sign a release for,",routine,85_46,T,id,,"आपके खास मामले में, इसके साथ साझा किए जाने वाले लोग सिर्फ उपचार टीम के अन्य सदस्य और किसी भी व्यक्ति को होंगे, जिसके लिए आ"
47,"but if the government asks you, you'd have to give them those results.",routine,85_47,P,crq,,Lekin agar sarkar tumse puche toh tumhe unhe wo nateeje dena hoga.
48,"There's no reason right now I did that there are certain limits to confidentiality. But in your situation here at this clinic, there's no reason I would share this information with the government or, or anybody else other than people indicated. So the rest of the people here to treat you. And if you wanted to release the results to somebody, you could sign a release I would let them have the results.",routine,85_48,T,id,,"Abhi abhi mere paas koi khaas vajah nahi thi ki maine aisa kiya kyunki kuch nishchit simit harkat hai gopniyata se sambandhit. Lekin aapki sthiti par is clinic mein, humare paas koi vajah nahi hai ki hum sarkar ya kisi aur se is jaankari ko share karen. Toh baaki sab log yahaan par aapki ilaaj ke liye hai. Aur agar aap kisi ko apne parinaam bataana chahte hai, aap ek authorization sign kar sakte hai jisse main unhe parinaam de sakta hu."
49,"Well, I'm worried that I know people are recording me. And I think that that results shows that I know that's happening. And now, you want to make it look like that means I have a problem. When I'm just reporting what I know is true.",routine,85_49,P,id,-2.0,"Yaar, mujhe chinta hai ki log mujhe record kar rahe hain. Aur main sochta hoon ki yeh parinaam dikhata hai ki mujhe pata hai yeh ho raha hai. Ab tu yeh dikhaana chahta hai ki iska matlab hai mere paas ek samasya hai. Jab ki main bas bata raha hoon jo main jaanta hoon sach hone ka."
50,"Well, I assume you're worried that",routine,85_50,T,od,,"वेल, मैं ध्यान रखता हूँ"
51,"no, I think that I know these things are happening. But this test says that I'm wrong to think that it makes me paranoid.",symp/reasoning,85_51,P,od,,"Haan, main sochta hun ki mujhe yeh cheezein ho rahi hain. Par yeh test kehta hai ki meri yeh soch galat hai aur mujhe ashanka dilata hai."
52,"Oh, I understand. Okay. So these things are really happening. Yeah. Right. But the test is arranged so that it's making it look paranoid when you're not exactly",routine,85_52,T,id,,Arre samajh aaya. Thik hai. Yeh cheezein sach me ghatna ho rahi hai. Haan. Sahi hai. Lekin yeh test aise arrange kiya gaya hai ki jab aap ekdum thik nahi hote toh aapko paranoid lagta hai.
53,Exactly. Okay.,routine,85_53,P,ack,,Bilkul sahi. Thik
54,So that would explain why your score is elevated on the scale. Okay. Is that? Is that what you're thinking? ,routine,85_54,T,yq,,Toh yeh samjha dena ki aapke score scale par udhar gaya hai. Okay. Kya yeh wahi hai? Kya yeh aapke mann mein chal raha hai?
55,I do. Yeah.,routine,85_55,P,op,,Main karunga. Haan.
56,And I wanted you to know that. I appreciate you telling me that. Do you think it's possible that it's working the other way around that the test is measuring something that is actually there?,routine,85_56,T,yq,,Aur mai chahta tha ki tumhe pata chale ki. Mujhe accha laga jab tumne mujhe bataya. Kya tumhe lagta hai ki yeh ho sakta hai ki test kisi aisi cheez ko measure kar raha hai jo asal mein maujood hai?
57,"No, I don't think so.",routine,85_57,P,on,,"Nahi, mujhe lagta nahi hai."
58,You don't think so. Okay.,inactive,85_58,T,crq,,Tumko lagta nahi hai. Theek hai.
59,I understand that. I'm higher than most people.,routine,85_59,P,cd,,Mujhe samajh aa raha hai. Main zyada logon se ucha hoon.
60,"you believe their situation is different than yours. Okay, I understand. So the last area, the last subscale I want to discuss this one global scale on discuss. Glass subscale is one that's referred to as psychoticism. And there you are at the 93rd percentile. And that's when maybe you can hear things other people hear or see things that people don't see, or have beliefs or thinking that are far outside the norm and can't be supported by evidence. They feel like that's happening to you.",story,85_60,T,id,,"Aap apki sooch unke to alag hai par humare jaisa unka kuch ghoshna hai. Theek hai, samajh gaya. Toh aakhri hissa, woh ek vishwa scale hai uspe hum baat kar sakte hai. Glass subscale ko ek prashansapad thora sa mante hai. Aur vaha apka 93rd percentile hai. Aur yahi vo waqt hota hai jab shayad ap dusre logon ki sunte hue jo cheeze sunte hai ya jo cheeze dekhte hai ya fir aapke vishvas ya soch bahut zyada atipravan hai, jiske liye aapko koi proof nahi milta. Apko esa lagta hai ki yeh sab apke saath ho raha hai."
61,Are you going to put me away?,routine,85_61,P,yq,,Kya tum mujhe alag karne ki baat kar rahe ho?
62,"There's There's nothing here that would indicate that I'm gonna put you away or center anywhere. Yeah, I just really this The purpose of this is just to discuss the results to make sure you understand kind of how these inform our treatment of you. Like so we're gonna provide treatment to impart based on these results.",routine,85_62,T,id,,"There nothing here that would give a hint that I'm gonna put you away or center anywhere. Yeah, I just want to talk about the results to ensure that you get how these inform our treatment of you. So we'll give you treatment according to these results."
63,Sometimes I hear things other people don't hear.,routine,85_63,P,id,,Kabhi kabhi mujhe wohi cheezen sunai deti hain jo dusre log nahi sunte.
64,"Okay, so this is a this is a score that makes makes sense to retake the test might be right.",routine,85_64,T,id,,"Okay, yeh toh ek aisa score hai jo phir se test dene ka sense bana sakta hai shayad."
65,"Maybe that's true. Maybe that's true. Okay, but I am being recorded,",routine,85_65,P,com,,"Shayad wo sach hai. Shayad wo sach hai. Theek hai, lekin main record kiya jaa raha hun."
66,"but you believe you're being recorded, you're starting to that.",routine,85_66,T,crq,,"Par fir bhi tu yeh manta hai ki tujhe record kiya ja raha hai, tu shuru kar raha hai woh."
67,close to normal.,routine,85_67,P,gc,,thodi se normal ke nazdik.
68,"Well, a little bit higher than we want to see.",routine,85_68,T,id,,"Aree bhai, hume thoda se ooncha dekhna hai."
69,Me I don't like to go out much.,routine,85_69,P,id,-1.0,Mai mujhe bahut jyada bahar jaane ka pasand nahi hai.
70,"So at the Paranoid if that if that scale was accurate, in your estimation, your global severity might be lower, I think, yeah. Closer to the 50 percentile, I think. So, even if you were closer to the 50 percentile, you can To understand how we're concerned that your symptoms are somewhat severe, and we want to make sure we deliver treatment to address that. Sure. Is that okay?",routine,85_70,T,yq,,"To aapki global gambhirata dhayansu se kam ho sakti hai, main sochta hun, haan. 50 percentile ke pass, mujhe lagta hai. Toh, agar aap 50 percentile ke pass bhi hote, hume yeh samajhne mein dikkat hai ki aapke lakshanon mein kuchh gambhirta hai, aur hume yeh dhyan rakhna hai ki hum upchar pradaan karte hain. Zaroor. Kya yeh theek hai?"
71,It is. Okay.,routine,85_71,P,op,,Yeh toh theek hai.
72,"So I will meet with the counselor that will be treating, you're here, and I'm going to go over these scores now explain to her what you've explained to me. Okay, in terms of why you think you might have received the score. Okay, I'll go over that with her. And of course, you could discuss it with her too, and she'll have the results of this test in your chart. ",routine,85_72,T,id,,"Toh main counselor se milunga jo aapka treatment karegi, aap yahan ho, aur main ab aapko aapne bataye huye scores ke baare mein usse samjhaoonga. Theek hai, ki aapko kyun lagta hai ki aapko ye score mila hai. Theek hai, main uske saath usko discuss karunga. Aur haan, aap bhi uske saath discuss kar sakte hain, aur uske paas aapke chart mein is test ke results honge."
73,Okay. Okay. She's not going to record our session.,inactive,85_73,P,cd,,Haa. Haa. Usne hamari session ki recording nahi karegi.
74,"She, she's not going to be recording. Okay.",inactive,85_74,T,cd,,"Woh, woh recording nahi karne wali. Theek hai."
75,It does.,inactive,85_75,P,ack,,Ye karta hai.
76,Okay. I appreciate you allow me to go over this set of results with you. And I'm going to show you assigned to that counselor and we'll move forward with treatment.,inactive,85_76,T,gt,,Okay. Main aapki sahamat ke liye aabhaar vyakt karna chahta hun ki aap mujhe is parinaam ki set ke saath jana do. Aur main aapko us counselor se jodaunga aur hum ilaaj ke saath aage badhenge.
77,"Okay. Thank thanks, Peggy.",inactive,85_77,P,gt,,"Hik. Dhanyawaad, Peggyji."
78,summary,"The therapist is reviewing the findings of SCL 90 test where the sub scales are little higher than expected. The patient is worried if the session is recorded and is assured by the therapist that it is not. The therapist highlights the patient scored 64 percentile on phobic anxiety symptoms. The patient agrees they don't like public transportations, crowds make them nervous, and they can't speak publicly. Next, the therapist says the patient has scored 84 percentile on paranoia. The patient argues that they know they are being recorded which is a fact and stating that makes the test to be true about paranoia about them which is not exactly. The patient still agrees they can be higher than most people for paranoia but not that high. The patient asks if these results be shared with the government for which the therapist clarifies it will only be shared with the treatment team. The last thing therapist highlights from the test is psychoticism in whcih they scored 93 percentile. The patient agrees that they do hear things that other's don't. The patient continues to express discomfort that they are being recorded. The therapist assured to setup the patient with a counselor and share the results with them. ",,,,,
