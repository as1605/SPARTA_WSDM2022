So,",story,174_45,P,id,-1.0,"Well, ek hi baat yaad aa rahi hai ki hamare program mein humare liye ek hi student hai.

Aur program ke dauraan maine apne aapko sabse acche grades wale student ki tarah consider kiya hai aur program ke ant mein ek award milta hai jo acche results pane ke liye diya jata hai.

Main sochti hoon ki yeh logon ko dikhayega ki maine sach mein mehnat ki aur is program mein accha kaam kiya. Hamare program ke liye ab tak, main us front runner ki tarah thi jo is award ke liye sabse aage badhi thi.

51,"I guess part of me feels like them. Why did I do the program? if, you know, part of me feels like if you're not going to be the best why try? So if, if she got the award over me, then it's kind of like, why did I work so hard this whole time, like I could have been slacking this whole time and just skated by so why did I bust my butt?

I remember you saying earlier that it's not just about the award and I would be happy with just getting the degree and all the things I've learned.
