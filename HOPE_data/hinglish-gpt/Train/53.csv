0,corleto how you doing today?,inactive,53_0,T,gt,,"Kaise ho, aaj tum kaisa kar rahe ho?"
1,good.,inactive,53_1,P,gt,,theek hai.
2,"I do well, thanks for asking. How'd you do this week?",inactive,53_2,T,gt,,"Main theekh hoon, shukriya poochh ne ke liye. Tum is hafte kaise the?"
3,Better?,inactive,53_3,P,gt,,Aur achha
4,"Well, last time we talked about that",symp/reasoning,53_4,P,crq,,"Arey, last time humne uske baare mein baat kari thi na."
5,"postponed gratification. Yeah,",symp/reasoning,53_5,T,cd,,Postpone kiya hua tarikhaani. Yeah.
6,"that um, and I think you wanted 10 minutes for me to put it off 10 minutes. Yeah. So",symp/reasoning,53_6,P,irq,,"That um, aur main yeh sochte hain ki tum chahte ho ki mujhe use aur 10 minutes ke liye 10 minutes delay kar doon. Haan."
7,I did better.,symp/reasoning,53_7,P,id,,Maine thoda aur ache se kiya.
8,"I think I ended up only doing like join a half instead of two I was able to put offered, I think, the 10 minutes a couple times. And then there were there was, I think one or two days where I went out for a walk because I was Tired of staring at the clock waiting for the 10 minutes to pass. So I got up, went for a walk. And then I passed one of my friends. So I ended up walking with her. And I actually didn't get back to my house for like an hour. So I kind of put it off for like an hour because then I came home and took a couple hits on",story,53_8,P,id,,"Mai sirf join karne ke badle mechanka ke man-mutawik dher sari barif lorke sekaf karenge, mai phir bhi chatha ki 10 minute ake kuch bar alag me chala jao. Aur tabhi do, teen din bad mai beet gaye chala jao ki mai ghar pohacha aur wo time mai bahaar nahi gya, kiasha ki mai peecha tana aur jahan mai mera dost bourbon mile. Iss tarah, mai wahan jhara gaya aur isskamai sath good bhatthay aie, mai ek ganta paw gayaa tha aur baba mai usko dhokha de sakte the."
9,so it sounds like you were able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana. At least in most cases. It was rough.,symp/reasoning,53_9,T,crq,,Toh lag raha hai ki tumne 10 minute tak marijuana pina rakh sakte the. Kam se kam zyadatar cases mein. Yeh tough tha.
10,It was rough. Yeah.,inactive,53_10,P,ack,,Woh toh bahut sakht tha. Haan.
11,"So it was it was difficult for you, but most cases, you're able to pull off the 10 minutes. Mm hmm. That sounds like there's a few instances where you're able to hold it off longer because something else kind of Yeah, came up.",routine,53_11,T,crq,,"Toh tu keh raha tha ki it was difficult for you, lekin generally, tere 10 minutes nikal jaate hai. Mm hmm. Aaisa lagta hai ki kuch cases mein tu apne ko aur der tak rok paata hai kyunki koi aur kaam aa gaya tha."
12,"Yeah, I found I actually talked to a couple people on the phone before I knew it like half hour to come by.",story,53_12,P,cd,,"Haan, mujhe pata chala ki maine phone pe kuch logon se baat ki thi, tabhi pata chala ki aadhe ghante mein aa jaane se pehle."
13,so another activity presented itself and You've forgotten with marijuana.,symp/reasoning,53_13,T,irq,,to aur ek activity saamne aayi aur Tum bhool gaye ki marijuana ke saath.
14,Kind of Yeah. Yeah. I guess I just wasn't thinking about it.,routine,53_14,P,ack,,Kuch si haan. Haan. Mere khayaalo mein woh baat toh nahi thi.
15,So have your feelings about marijuana change since we last talked?,routine,53_15,T,yq,,Toh kya aakhiri baar hum baat karne ke baad se teri feelings ganja ke baare mein badal gayi hai?
16,"No, not really. ",routine,53_16,P,on,,"Nahi, bilkul nahi."
17,Tell me about that.,inactive,53_17,T,irq,,Batao mujhe uske bare me.
18,"I mean, it's I don't see it as a problem. It's it's legal in a lot of states now. And I mean, it's not that bad for you. It doesn't really endanger me much.",routine,53_18,P,id,,"Mujhe matlab hai, yeh mere liye ek samasya nahi lagta. Isse bahut saare states mein legal maana jata hai. Aur main samajh raha hoon, yeh aapke liye itna bura nahi hai. Yeh meri jaan ko zyada khatra nahi deta hai."
19,So you still you still believe you should have the right to smoke marijuana?,routine,53_19,T,yq,,Kya tum abhi bhi yeh mante ho ki tumhe marijuana smoke karne ka haq hona chahiye?
20,"Yeah, I mean, I'm not hurting anybody else. ",routine,53_20,P,ack,,"Haan, matlab, main kisi aur ko nuksaan nahi pahuncha raha hu."
21,"But at the same time, you want to go back to work. And if I remember, right, you're the person that you could go work for. I guess you know them right. Yeah, it's my uncle, your uncle, and you need to be cleaned for was about two months.",symp/reasoning,53_21,T,crq,,"Lekin bhaichaari, tum chahte ho ki tum kaam par waapas jao. Aur agar mujhe yaad hai, toh tum wohi insaan ho jiske liye tum kaam kar sakte ho. Mera matlab hai, tumhe unko jaante ho, right? Haan, woh mera chacha hai, tumhara chacha, aur tumhe dhoona padega kyunki tum lagbhag do mahine se naha nahi rahe ho."
22,"Yeah, two to three months.",symp/reasoning,53_22,P,cd,,"हाँ, दो से तीन महीने।"
23,So,inactive,53_23,T,gc,,Toh
24,"you have kind of opposing forces here, right? You have your enjoyment of marijuana. And then you, you know, that's something you like you don't wanna give up. And you believe you have a right to do that. But then there's that job.",story,53_24,T,irq,,"Tumhare paas yahaan virodhi bal hai na? Tumhare paas marihuana ki liye anand hai. Lekin tum jaante ho, yeh koi cheez hai jise tumhaare chhodna nahin chahte. Aur tum maante ho ki iski karne ka tumhaare paas adhikar hai. Par phir bhi wahi naukri hai."
25,"Yeah, I mean, my parents are pretty cool with it, like they know. But I mean, I'm at the point now where they kind of want me to move on and move out. But I don't know. I mean, I just, it'd be nice to have that job. Like, it's a really good job, but at the same time, like, I don't see why I have to sacrifice something that I like. ",story,53_25,P,id,,"Haan, main toh yah sochta hu, mere mummy-papa ko bhi pata hai, aur woh kaafi thik hai uske saath. Par ab toh main saari baatein aage badha kar aage badhna chahata hu, aur ghar se alag hona chahata hu. Par mujhe samajh nahi aata. Main toh sirf chahta hu ek acha job mil jaaye. Par phir bhi, main samajh nahi aata ki mujhe apni pasand ko chhod kar kuch karna hi padta hai."
26,So it doesn't seem fair to you. But she recognizes the reality of your situation.,routine,53_26,T,gc,,Isliye tumhe lagta nahi hai ki yeh sahi hai. Lekin woh tumhari halat ki haqeeqat ko maanti hai.
27,Yeah.,routine,53_27,P,ack,,Haan.
28,So it really does come down in your instance to marijuana use or appointment.,routine,53_28,T,irq,,Toh yeh haqeeqat mein aapki sthiti mein ganja istemaal ya appointment par hi nirbhar hai.
29,"Yeah, it's pretty accurate.",routine,53_29,P,ack,,"Haan, yeh kaafi sahi hai."
30,So you're not happy about that choice.,routine,53_30,T,yq,,Toh tum khush nahi ho us vikalp ke baare mein.
31,"And kind of what we did with the postpone gratification was just really just ask you to wait 10 minutes and you were able to do that. And more, although it's difficult, ",routine,53_31,T,orq,,"और किस प्रकार हमने ठीक वह किया जो हमने ताली रखा गुण है, वह बस हक़ीक से तुमसे माँगने के लिए यह की तुम दस मिनट का प्रतीक्षा करते हो और तुम उसे कर सकते हो। और उससे ज़्यादा, ह"
32,it's difficult.,routine,53_32,P,od,,Yeh mushkil hai.
33,It's difficult for you.,inactive,53_33,T,crq,,Yeh aapke liye mushkil hai.
34,So,inactive,53_34,T,gc,,Toh
35,I asked you to track the number of times you smoke marijuana. Did you really track that over the last week?,routine,53_35,T,irq,,Mene aap se kaha hai ki aap mariyahuana fume karne ki baar baar ginti kare. Kya aapne sach me pichhle hafto mein uska jankaari rakha hai?
36,"Yeah, you remember how many times that was?",routine,53_36,T,irq,,"Arey, tu yaad karta hai kitni baar woh tha?"
37, I think,inactive,53_37,P,gc,,Main hu
38,think I,inactive,53_38,P,gc,,Mujhe lagta hai ki main.
39,"think it like 15. Okay, between 15 and 20,",routine,53_39,P,id,,"सोचो 15 का रूप अगस्त । अच्छा, 15 और 20 के बी"
40,between 15 and 20. And how many times did something kind of get in the way that's something else come up in that 10 minutes span that distracted you or that you enjoyed,,53_40,T,crq,,15 और 20 के बीच। और उस 10 मिनट सीमा में कितनी बार कुछ न कुछ एक और चीज आपकी राह में आगयी या आपको भटकायी जो आपको आनंद दिया।
41,"I'm like,",inactive,53_41,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta hai ki,"
42,"almost closer to 20 times I guess, otherwise, I probably would have kept going smoke more. I mean, there were a couple times where like somebody would call me or somebody would text me and that kind of distracted me and so I was able to put it off for a little bit.",story,53_42,P,id,,"20 baar tak maine lagbhag kar liya, warna main shayad jaari rakhta smoke more. Mera matlab hai, kuch baar aisa hua ki koi mujhe call ya message karta tha aur is se mujhe thoda attention divert ho gaya, isliye maine thoda sa postpone kar diya."
43,"So you can see in that 10 minutes, things can happen. Right things can happen that can help you to avoid the marijuana. Sometimes nothing does and after 10 minutes, use it. And sometimes something does kind of get in the way with a marijuana like distract you or you have another activity that you enjoy and then you didn't use.",story,53_43,T,od,,"Toh aap dekh sakte hai ki uss 10 minutes mein, cheezein ho sakti hai. Sahi cheezein ho sakti hai jo aapko marijuana se bacha sakti hai. Kabhi kabhi kuch nahi hota hai aur 10 minutes ke baad, aap uska istemaal karte hai. Aur kabhi kabhi kuch ho jata hai jaise ki marijuana aapko distract kar deta hai ya phir aapko koi aur activity pasand hai aur phir aapne nahi use kiya."
44,So with that in mind,routine,53_44,T,irq,,Iss baat ko dhyan mein rakh ke
45,"you found the experience rough, but was it tolerable? ",routine,53_45,T,irq,,"Tumne anubhav sakht paya, par kya wo sahne yogya tha?"
46,"Yeah, Was it bad ",routine,53_46,P,ack,,"हाँ, यह क्या बुरा था"
47,was a bit Do you think for this next week? We could try postpone gratification from 10 minutes to 20 minutes?,symp/reasoning,53_47,T,cd,,Kya aapko lag raha hai ki hum iss hafte ke liye thoda intezaar kar sakte hai? Hum 10 minutes ki jagah 20 minutes tak ka anand tay kar sakte hai?
48,"I don't know. That seems kinda. Yeah, that seems like a longer time",symp/reasoning,53_48,P,id,,"Mujhe nahi pata hai. Woh thoda sa sahi lagta hai. Haan, woh jaisa ek lamba samay lagta hai."
49,that that is definitely. That is a longer time. ,routine,53_49,T,gc,,Wo hain hi aisa. Wo ek aadh daer ka waqt hain.
50,I don't know about that.,routine,53_50,P,gc,,Mujhe uske bare mein nahi pata.
51,Yeah.,inactive,53_51,T,gc,,Haan.
52,"Maybe like 15 minutes,",routine,53_52,P,od,,Shayad aadhe ghante ke aas-paas.
53,"no compromises. 15 Okay, do you think you could maintain 15 minutes weighing 15? ",symp/reasoning,53_53,T,crq,,"Koi moharne ki koi kami nahi. 15 Theek hai, tum sochte ho ki tum 15 minute ko 15 rakh sakte ho?"
54,I think I could try a little bit more than 20.,symp/reasoning,53_54,P,cd,,मुझे लगता है कि मैं 20 से थोड़ा ज़्यादा कोशिश कर सकता
55,"All right, so let's go with 15 minutes, right. So 15 minutes, you know, as compared to 10. I'll give you five extra minutes that something could happen that could distract you. And you wouldn't use that instance, right. There's also, you know, to constructively use that time, you could consider alternatives like like you mentioned walking right. You could use that time and start walking. Yeah. Anything else that that you like, maybe in the past on occasion when you want to use marijuana, but she didn't have anything available? What would you do instead?",story,53_55,T,irq,,"Chalo, 15 minutes chalte hain, thik hai. Toh 15 minutes, 10 ke comparison mein, panch extra minutes deta hoon taki kuch ho jaye jo tumhe distract kar de. Aur tum use instance ko use nahi karenge, right. Waise bhi, us time ko constructively use karne ke liye, tum alternatives ko consider kar sakte ho, jaise ki tumne mention kiya walking. Tum us time ko use karke walking start kar sakte ho. Aur haan. Koi aur cheez jo tumhe achi lagti hai, shayad kabhi kabhi jab tum marijuana use karna chaho par kuch available nahi ho. Toh tum kya karte ho?"
56,"binge watch TV,",routine,53_56,P,id,,TV देखो पकड़ ल
57,"or should it be okay, well, so perhaps in that 15 minute time period that that timer you're delaying using marijuana, you could start watching the show.",routine,53_57,T,yq,,"ya thik hai ya toh theek hai, toh shayad us 15 minute ke dauran jismein aap timer ka upyog karke marijuana ka istemal der rahe hain, aap show dekhne shuru kar sakte hain."
58,"Yeah, I can do that.",routine,53_58,P,ack,,"Haan, main voh kar sakta hoon."
59,"At the under 15 minutes, you might end up using marijuana or you might want to continue watching the show. So do you see kind of how it works? Like is it making sense to you the postponing?",symp/reasoning,53_59,T,irq,,"""15 मिनट के अंदर, आप मारिजुआना का उपयोग कर सकते हैं या आप शो देखना जारी रखना चाहते हो। तो क्या आप देखते हो कि ये कैसे काम करता है? क्या आपको समझ आ रहा है कि ये अपवाद को बड़वाना है?"""
60,"Yeah, it doesn't make it any easier, but it's tough for you. Yeah. Yeah. No, I definitely see how helps",routine,53_60,P,id,,"Yeah, yeh usse koi aasan nahi banaata, par tumhare liye mushkil hai. Haan, haan. Nahi, mai bilkul samajhta hoon kaise madad kartaa hai."
61,And maybe if we're successful to 15?,routine,53_61,T,irq,,Aur kya hum 15 tak safal ho jaayenge?
62,Who knows? We'll move it up from there.,routine,53_62,T,irq,,Kaun jaanta hai? Hum wahan se usse aage le jayenge.
63,"Maybe we'll see how the 15 goes, see",routine,53_63,P,gc,,"Shayad hum dekhte hai ki 15 kaise jaata hai, dekhte hai."
64,"how it goes the 15? Yeah, I'll see how that goes. You know, I'm hoping. And I hope this kind of makes sense that there'll be a point where you will be really interfering with the vast majority of the times that use marijuana. Like because you're giving yourself that many more opportunities, the longer you wait. Right. The more minutes you wait, the more opportunities for something else to get in the way so to speak. And probably what you'll see, just like you saw this last because you're, you know, you used marijuana less frequently, just by waiting the 10 minutes. Even though you described as difficult I'm sure it was, but there were a few times where it kind of worked out",story,53_64,T,irq,,"Aree bhai, 15 kaise jaata hai? Haan, main dekhungi ki woh kaise jaata hai. Pata hai, main ummeed karta hu. Aur mujhe yeh ummeed hai ki yeh kuch sense bana ke rakhenge ki ek point aayega jab aap zyada se zyada baar marijuana chalayege jaha tum interfere karoge. Jaise ki kyunki aapne apne aapko zaroori zyada opportunities di hain, jitni der aap wait karenge. Sahi hai, jitni der wait karo, aur zyada opportunities hai ki kuch aur raaste main aaye, toh baat toh yahi hai. Aur shayad yeh dekhenge, jaise ki aapne abhi dekha jab ki aapne marijuana kam use kiya, bas pure 10 minutes wait karte rehte hue. Ek baat batau, dikkat thi bhi toh thi, par thodi baar aisa hua ki kaam kar gaya."
65,Yeah.,routine,53_65,P,ack,,Haan.
66,"So, I think that planning something for that time would be helpful. And try to plan something 15 minutes, even if you fully intend to beyond the 15 to go right and use, I think it's still useful plan something in there. You never know that might take you. Or you might end up walking or watching TV or doing something else that would distract you or pull you away from the marijuana use. Okay. So that's like a plan.",inactive,53_66,T,irq,,"So, main sochta hun ki uss samay kuch plan karna faydemand hoga. Aur 15 minutes ke liye kuch plan karni ki koshish karo, chahe aap 15 minutes se zyada jana chahte ho ya use karna chahte ho, main sochta hun ki usme koi na koi fayda hai. Kaun jaanta, shayad koi kaam aa jaye. Ya toh aap chalne lag jaaye ya TV dekhne lage ya kuch aur karein jo aapka dhyaan marijuana se hatane ya door karne ke liye hata de. Thik hai, toh yeh aisa hi jaise ek plan hai."
67,"Yeah, I think I can give that a try.",inactive,53_67,P,ack,,"Haan, main soch raha hoon ki main usko ek koshish de sakta hoon."
68,Okay,inactive,53_68,P,gt,,ठीक
69,Sounds like a plan?,inactive,53_69,T,gt,,Kya ye ek plan lag raha hai?
70,"Yeah, I think we can manage that.",inactive,53_70,P,gt,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai hum usse sambhaal sakte hain."
71,"All right. We'll go with that. And I'll see you next week. Okay, thank you.",routine,53_71,T,gt,,"Thik hai. Hum uske sath jayenge. Aur main tumhe agle hafte dekhenge. Thik hai, Dhanyavaad."
72,summary,"Last week, postponed gratification was discussed with the patient. The patient has successfully been able to maintain waiting 10 minutes to smoke marijuana at least in most cases roughly. There has been instances where patient even forgot marijuana. The patient feels the same towards marijuana since last session since it is legal in many states and does not hurt anybody else. However, the patient has a nice job at uncle's for which they need to be clean for two to three months.  The patient does not see why to sacrifice this for a job. The patient is requested if they can postpone gratification from 10 to 15 minutes. The patient is suggested if they can watch a show to use up time. The therapist clarifies that the patient is giving many more opportunities to interfere by longer they wait. The therapist will see the patient next week. ",,,,,
