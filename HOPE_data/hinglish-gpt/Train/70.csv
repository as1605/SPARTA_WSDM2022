0,"Good afternoon, Bruce. I'm glad you could make it in today. Thanks for coming in. Last week when you were you had come in because you had had a positive urine analysis test for marijuana. And so we were working on ways that you could cut down or extinguish marijuana use altogether. And how did you feel about our talk last week?",symp/reasoning,70_0,T,gt,,"Arrey Bruce, namaste. I'm glad you could make it in today yaar. Thanks for coming in. Last week when you were you had come munh mein gaali hone do to say tha cuz you had had a positive urine analysis test for marijuana. And so hum yeh soch rahe the ki tere tarike se marijuna ka samooth ho ya sara jadooch i mean use hi bhul jaye. Aur kya vibe hai, humare talk se last week?"
1,"It was okay, I guess.",symp/reasoning,70_1,P,id,,"यह ठीक था, मुझे लगता ह"
2,Yeah. Just okay.,inactive,70_2,T,crq,,Haan. Bas theek hai.
3,Yeah.,inactive,70_3,P,ack,,Haan.
4,"All right. Okay, so I want to refresh your memory and I've got my notes here. Do you mind if I refer to my notes? ",routine,70_4,T,yq,,"Thik hai. Theek hai, toh main tumhari memory ko refresh karna chahta hoon aur mere paas mere notes hai. Kya tumhe problem hai agar main apne notes se refer karun?"
5,okay,inactive,70_5,P,ack,,The sentence can be
6,yeah.,routine,70_6,T,gc,,hmm haan
7,"Yeah, I wasn't in the mood.",inactive,70_7,P,on,,"Haan, main mood mein nahi tha."
8,I'm wondering what you could have done in the world.,inactive,70_8,T,orq,,Main soch raha hoon ki tumne duniya mein kya kar sakta tha.
9,I'm not sure what I could have done.,inactive,70_9,P,od,,मैं यकीन नहीं कर पा रहा हूं कि मैंने क्या क
10,"And so because of the not exercising, did it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week?",symp/reasoning,70_10,T,irq,,"And thus, kya is hafte aapke marijuana ka prayog karne mei koi farq padha hai, kyuki aap ne vyayam nahi kiya?"
11,"Yeah, it was used a bit more.",symp/reasoning,70_11,P,id,,"Haan, woh thoda zyada istemal hua tha."
12,Okay. Okay. So how would you tie those two things together By not running?,symp/reasoning,70_12,T,irq,,Theek hai. Theek hai. Toh aap kaise uss do cheezon ko jodenge By nahin chalane se?
13,"I think the mix when I'm not exercising, generally I would turn to the more usage.",symp/reasoning,70_13,P,id,,"I think jab main exercise nahi kar raha hota hoon, generally main zyada use karne ki taraf milti."
14,"Yeah, yeah. So when you reflect back now on last week, and the rain coming down, and it was cold, I'm wondering if there was a way that you could change your perception about that, such that it wouldn't stop you from running. What do you think?",routine,70_14,T,irq,,"Haan, haan. Toh jab tum last week ki yaad karte ho, aur baarish ho rahi thi, aur dhoop jhulson yeh mahsoos hua tha, Mujhe sochne par majboor kardeti thi ke kya tum is baare mein apni rai badal sakte the, jisse ki tumhe daudne se rok na paati. Tum kya sochte ho?"
15,"Yeah To change the perception above, maybe wear a rain jacket or something.",routine,70_15,P,od,,"Yeah Perception badalne ke liye, shayad ek rain jacket ya kuchh pehne."
16,"Mm hmm, that would be a great idea. That would be an excellent idea.",routine,70_16,T,ack,,"Bilkul, woh ek bahut accha idea hoga. Woh ek shandar idea hoga."
17,"Well, I tried to stay away, but I didn't. I still saw some of them.",routine,70_17,P,id,,"Haan, maine poori koshis ki dhur se dur rehne ki, par main nahi kar paya. Main unme se kuch dekha hua tha."
18,So it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life? Last week?,routine,70_18,T,yq,,Arre kya tu apni zindagi se unko bahar nikalna mushkil tha? Pichhle hafte?
19,Yeah.,routine,70_19,P,ack,,Haan.
20,"And  you tell me more but what was difficult about it,",routine,70_20,T,irq,,"Aur tum mujhe aur batavo lekin usme kya mushkil tha,"
21,"the stuff that they think something badly of the I didn't want them to think  You know, avoiding the raising.",routine,70_21,P,id,,"Woh vahi cheez jo unko lagta hai ki maine kuch bure tarike se socha, main unhe yahi nahi sochna chahta tha. Pata hai, main bach gaya."
22,So you did it sounds like you didn't want to hurt their feelings.,routine,70_22,T,yq,,"Toh tumne kar hi diya, lagta hai tumhe unki bhawnao ko thes pahuchana nahi tha."
23,Yes,inactive,70_23,P,ack,,Haan
24,by them thinking that you were going to avoid them.,routine,70_24,T,yq,,Unka log sochte the ke tum unse bachne ki jagah ja rahe ho.
25,yes,inactive,70_25,P,ack,,haan
26,And so as a result of this what what happened?,routine,70_26,T,irq,,Toh iski wajah se kya kya hua?
27,"Well, I just ended up going to see them and then hanging out.And, yeah.",routine,70_27,P,id,,"Bhai, main bas karne gaya aur unhe dekhne ke liye aur phir timepass karna. Aur haan."
28,"So because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them, you ended up using marijuana. Is that correct?",routine,70_28,T,yq,,"Toh kya aap unhe aapko bachne ki koshish kar rahi thi samajhne ke baare mein chinta karne se woh sochne lage, isliye aapne maarijuana ka istemaal kar liya. Kya yeh sahi hai?"
29,Yeah.,inactive,70_29,P,ack,,Haan.
30,And I'm wondering how you could do that differently this week.,inactive,70_30,T,irq,,Aur main vichaar kar rahi hoon ki iss week aap ise alag tarike se kaise kar sakte hain.
31,"Well, I could, I suppose I could just try hard enough to go and see you guys.",routine,70_31,P,id,,"Accha, main kar sakti hoon, main suppose karti hoon ki main bahut koshish karke tumhe dekhne ja sakti hoon."
32,And what would that involve trying harder not to go see them?,routine,70_32,T,yq,,Aur yeh kya aapke liye zaroori hoga ki zyaada koshish karein unhe dekhne se bachne ke liye?
33,Hmm.,inactive,70_33,P,ack,,Ohh.
34,Yeah. Sometimes it is that simple is just making that commitment. yourself and just drawing the line. And do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with?,routine,70_34,T,irq,,"Haan. Kabhi kabhi yeh ekdum aasaan hota hai ki bas uss aadesh ko nibhana. Apne aap se waada karke aur ek lakshya banakar. Aur kya tumhare paas koi dost hain jo marijuana ka istemaal na karte ho, jinse tum juda ho sakte ho?"
35,"Yes i do, I don't feel that often, but I could, I could start to see that more. ",routine,70_35,P,id,,"Haan main karti hoon, main aksar aisa mehsoos nahi karti, par main kar sakti thi, mujhe woh zyaada dikhne lag sakti thi."
36,Okay. How about motivated on a scale of one to 10? Would you say you are to kind of reignite friendships with people that don't smoke pot?,symp/reasoning,70_36,T,irq,,Acha. Ek se dus tak motivated feel karoge? Kya aap yeh keh sakte hai ki aap un logo ke saath dosti banana chahte hai jo weed nahi fumate?
37,Three.,symp/reasoning,70_37,P,id,,Teen.
38,"Okay. So you're still, you're still a little iffy about you about whether you want to associate with those friends again, but I have to ask you, Bruce, what do you what made you say three instead of one?",routine,70_38,T,irq,,"Thik hai. Toh tum ab bhi, tum abhi thoda sa doubtful ho ki tum un doston se fir se judna chahte ho ya nahi, lekin mujhe tumse poochna hi padega, Bruce, tumhare munh se 3 bola tumne ek ki bajay mein kya?"
39,"Well, because I know for all, so I feel like I need to, I think I should start doing something about it.",routine,70_39,P,id,,"Achha, kyunki main sabke liye jaanta hoon, isiliye mujhe aisa lagta hai ki mujhe iske baare mein kuch karna chahiye."
40,"I think that's great insight that you're able to see that moving towards The friends that don't smoke pot and making the effort to do that is actually going to enhance your life incredibly. And when you associated with the friends that didn't smoke pot in the past, what kind of things did you do?",story,70_40,T,irq,,"Mai lagta hai ki yeh bahut acchi baat hai ki tumhe pata hai ki un dosto ke taraf badhna jo pot nahi peete hai aur unke saath janna chaho, yeh tumhare jeevan ko behatar banana mein kaam ayega. Aur jab tum un dosto se jude the jo pehle pot nahi peete the, tab tum kya-kya karte the?"
41,Like what what kind of things activities and things?,routine,70_41,P,crq,,Tumko yaar kaisa kaisi cheezo aur kaamo se kaam?
42,Yeah. Was it fun to be with them?,routine,70_42,T,cd,,Haan. Kya unke saath rehna mazedaar tha?
43,"Yeah, it was fun. Yeah, we just mostly are like doing some outdoor activities, maybe just sort of get some pressure kind of thing. Usually it's not so like, you know, there's more. They tend to do more healthy activities, I would say.",symp/reasoning,70_43,P,id,,"Haan, mazaa aaya. Haan, hum mainly kuch outdoor activities kar rahe hain, shayad thoda pressure kuchh le rahe hain. Aam taur par yeh aise nahi hai ki aap jaante honge, zyaada hai. Woh zyada se zyada sehatmand activities karte hain, main keh sakta hoon."
44,"So you can recall living a healthier life then and having fun outdoors and basically having a healthier life overall, without using the pot.",symp/reasoning,70_44,T,orq,,"Toh aap taza zindagi yaad kar sakte hain aur bahar maza le sakte hain aur basically aap overall taza zindagi guzaar sakte hain, pot istemal kiye bina."
45,Yeah You're right there. It could be I might take my mind off of it.,routine,70_45,P,od,,"Haan, tum sahi keh rahe ho. Shayad main apni yeh baat se hata lu."
46,"Sometimes it's good to remember having those good times with the friends that didn't smoke the pot because it makes you realize that you don't really need it. And I think that's a great, I think that's a great idea.",routine,70_46,T,gc,,"Kabhi kabhi woh saare acche pal yaad rakhna achha hota hai jab hamare dost jo nasha nahi karte the, hamare saath acche waqt bitate the. Kyunki jab aap yeh yaad karte hain, aapko pata chalta hai ki aapko iski zarurat nahi hai. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki ye bahut accha idea hai, bahut acchi baat hai."
47,Was I really had a lot of second thoughts. I was worried about commitment and that kind of thing. So I didn't feel like that was the right the right idea.,routine,70_47,P,gc,,Kya main sach mein bahut saari second thoughts thi. Main commitment se pareshan tha aur aisi cheezo se. Isliye mujhe aisa nahi lag raha tha ki yeh sahi vichaar hai.
48,"Okay, so you had some second thoughts about that. You're excited about it and last week's session, but after you had a chance to reflect upon it, you kind of realized that it wasn't getting a dog was not the best Thanks for you, ",routine,70_48,T,gc,,"Acha, toh tumhe uske baare mein kuch doosre khayal aagaye the. Tum uspar excited ho aur peechle hafte ki session ke baare mein, lekin baad mein jab tumne uske upar vichaar kiya, tum samajh gaye ki ek kutta paalna tumhare liye theek nahi tha. Dhanyavaad."
49,a lot of commitment and a lot of time that I just don't have the motivation to be putting in.,routine,70_49,P,gc,,"Bohut saara commitment aur bohut saara samay hai, lekin mujhe vahi sankalp nahi hai ki mai isme lagatar mehnat karu."
50,"I think that's wise to recognize that right up front, I'm given the research on pets any kind of pet, and how it helps people sustained from alcohol and drug usage. I'm wondering if there is another option that you might consider. ",routine,70_50,T,gc,,"Hinglish:
I think that's wise to recognise that right up front, I'm given the research on pets, any kind of pet, and how it helps people sustain from alcohol and drug usage. I'm wondering if there is another option that you might consider."
51,Maybe. What do you have in mind?,routine,70_51,P,crq,,Shayad. Tumhare dil mein tumhare paas kuch hai?
52,"I'm thinking, do you like pets that aren't don't require such a commitment?",symp/reasoning,70_52,T,cd,,"Hinglish:

Main soch raha hoon, kya tumhe aise jaanwar pasand hai jo itni zimmedari na maange?"
53,That's a good idea. I didn't think about that.,symp/reasoning,70_53,P,id,,Yeh ek accha idea hai. Mujhe uske baare mein nahi socha tha.
54,Because a dog is the dog is a large commitment.,routine,70_54,T,gc,,"Kyunki ek kutta ek bada vachan hai, is liye ek bada zimmedari hai."
55,"Yeah. You know, there's all kinds of animals, snakes or fish or something.",routine,70_55,P,gc,,"Haan. Tum jaante ho, saari tarah ke janwar hote hain, saanp ya machli ya kuchh aur."
56,"Hey, snakes ! fish, that would definitely be a star these animals that you like. ",routine,70_56,T,gc,,"Hi, saanp ! Machli, yeh toh pakka ek taara hoti hai yeh jaanwar jo tumhe pasand hai."
57,Yeah.,inactive,70_57,P,gc,,Haan.
58," All right, I think it's important that you have an animal that you like and that you can relate to. Alright, so in the final goal was to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be abstinent from marijuana. How did you make out with that?",routine,70_58,T,irq,,"Theek hai, mujhe lagta hai ki tumhe ek aisa jaanwar chahiye jo tumhe pasand ho aur jisse tum fer se jud sakoge. Theek hai, toh aakhiri lakshya yeh tha ki tum dhoondo aur ek aise support group se jud jao jaha log marijuana se surakshit rahne ki koshish kar rahe the. Tumne uske saath kaisa nikala?"
59,"I look into it. But like, I went to the first the first meeting, and I just felt like, like, those people were bought on the barrel and I was just not I just didn't fit in with that crowd where they are not in that place.",symp/reasoning,70_59,P,id,,"Mai is baare me dekhungi. Par jaise hi, mai pehli baar ki meeting me gayi, mujhe yun laga, ki jo log bikhari ki tarah kharide gaye the, mai unme se nahi thi. Mai hamesha un logo ke saath adjust nahi kar paati, jinke paas wo darjana nahi hai ya jo us jagah par nahi hai."
60,So you made the effort to go and you went,routine,70_60,T,crq,,Tusi toh you ne koshish ki woh jaane ki aur tu gaya
61,"I couldn't, I just didn't want to stay.",routine,70_61,P,cd,,"Main tha hi nahi, bas main rukhna hi nahi chahta tha."
62,And so you didn't stay the whole time.,routine,70_62,T,yq,,Aur isliye tune poora samay nahin bitaya.
63,Right.,inactive,70_63,P,ack,,Thik hai.
64,And so you left early because you felt you didn't feel and you they were the bottom of the barrel and you're still higher functioning.,routine,70_64,T,yq,,और सो यू तुमने जल्दी छोड़ दिया क्योंकि तुम्हें ऐसा महसूस हुआ कि तुम ठीक से नहीं थे और उसके साथ वे कड़ी भलाई को छोड़ दिया गया थ
65,Yeah,inactive,70_65,P,ack,,Actually haan
66,I can definitely understand I'm wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you. what Do you think?,routine,70_66,T,irq,,मैं बिलकुल समझ सकता हूं कि क्या आपको किसी समर्थन समूह से जुड़ने का कोई उद्देश्य है जो आपको मदद कर सकता है। आपको लगता है कि क्या?
67,See there could be some positive. I just don't I don't I just don't see it that much at this point.,routine,70_67,P,id,,"Dekho, kuch positive toh ho sakte hain. Mai bas nahi dekhta, bilkul nahi dekhta iss point par."
68,And what might be some positives that you would get out of the support group?,routine,70_68,T,irq,,"Aur kya kuch positive points honge, jinse aap support group se fayda utha sakte hain?"
69,"Well, I would, I would probably be able to relate to people in the same kind of situation. And maybe it's just a positive to be able to have connection with people like that. I'm not sure.",routine,70_69,P,id,,"Mai karunga, shayad mai un logo se jude rah sakunga jo meri tarah ek situation me hain. Aur ho sakta hai ki yeh ek positive ho ke aise logo se judna. Mai sakht nahi hu."
70,"So you're you're saying that the past of being in a support group would be that you'd get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey, and to have connections with other people. And again, I can send you information that will show you that that just these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pot, but from increasing the feel good hormones in your body, the connection and the relating to other people. It might be similar when you were younger, you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player. And so you had support that was sort of like the team was sort of like a support group. I'm wondering if you could relate to people in head connections and wondering if you could see a support group as a team.",story,70_70,T,irq,,"Toh kya tum keh rahe ho ki support group mein hone ka past aapko mauka mil jata tha dusre logon se jude rehne ka, jo wahi safar tay kar rahe hote hain, aur dusron se rishte banane ka? Aur phir, main aapko aise information bhi bhej sakti hoon jo aapko dikhayegi ki sirf ye do cheezein hi nahi, balki aap apne shareer mein feel good hormones ko badhane ke liye bhi madadgar hain, jaise connection aur dusron se jude rehna. Shayad jab aap chote the, toh aapne pichle hafte ke post mein bhi bataya tha ki aap ek hockey player the. Aur tab aapko support milta tha, jo kuch tarah se team ki tarah ek support group ki tarah tha. Main soch rahi hoon ki kya aap logon se jude reh sakte hain aur kya aap ek support group ko ek team ki tarah dekh sakte hain."
71,"Yeah, it would probably be the same kind of situation like Essentially, people in a support group are all there for the same goal. So it's kind of like in hockey. Very important there to win. Mm hmm.",symp/reasoning,70_71,P,id,,"Yup, it would most likely be the same jaisa situation like Waise hi, log jo support group mein hote hai woh sab ek hi goal ke liye hote hain. Toh yeh thoda sa hockey ki tarah hai. Bada mahatwapurna hai wahan jeetna. Mm hmm."
72,"And do you remember when you were playing hockey, how it felt to be encompassed in that team? ",routine,70_72,T,irq,,"Aur tujhe yaad hai jab tu hockey khel raha tha, us time team mein shamil hone ka ehsaas kaisa tha?"
73,"Yeah, it was good. ",routine,70_73,P,id,,"Haan, yeh accha tha."
74,"It gave. And that's because of those good feeling hormones that come in neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections. So how committed do you think you are? If I were to send you a list of support groups? So you could try out some others? Where there weren't the bottom of the barrel? As you say, there? how committed Do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week?",routine,70_74,T,irq,,"Ye diya. Aur vo isliye, kyunki voh accha ahsaas wale hormones dete hai jo transmitter ke roop mein aate hai aur jab aapke body mein jate hain toh jahan aapke connection hote hain. Toh aap kitna committed sochte hain? Agar main aapko support groups ki list bhejun? Jahan aap kuch aur try kar sakte hain? Jahan bottom of the barrel nahi hain? Jaise ki aapne kaha, vahan? Toh aap kitna committed hai ki aap kam se kam do maiyon mein se kam se kam do try karenge agle hafta?"
75,"Probably eight, or 10. Yeah.",routine,70_75,P,id,,"हो सकता है आठ, या 10. हां"
76,"Wow. What made you say an eight rather than a four, five was just",routine,70_76,T,gc,,"Wow. Kya tumne ek aath ke jagah chaar, paanch kyu bola?"
77,"a team analogy, I think is a good analogy.",routine,70_77,P,gc,,"अगर मेरा विचार हो, एक टीम की तुलना में अनुपम त"
78,So you thought How you remembered. You remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection?,routine,70_78,T,irq,,Tu socha ki tu kaise yaad rakh rahe thhe. Tumhe yaad hai ki tum kaise mehsoos kar rahe thhe jab tum team mein the aur woh tumhe us jazbaat se jod deta tha?
79,"Yeah. And also, you know, I don't have to be the mean, if, if I think of it as a team, maybe I would be like the star on the team, because I'm not quite so bottom of the barrel. Maybe",routine,70_79,P,id,,"Haan. Aur pata hai, mujhe bura hone ki zaroorat nahi hai, agar main use ek team ki tarah sochoon, shayad main team mein sitaara ban jaaunga, kyunki main itni niche nahi hoon. Shayad."
80,"I love that analogy. Good thinking. It's thinking, Bruce. That's excellent. Wow. Well, just to summarize, today, you came in, you had made some progress, but you had some stumbling blocks. You have decided that whether it's rain or shine, you're going to run anyway, because you're going to have you raincoat and you're going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting it Dog, you're going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing? ",story,70_80,T,gc,,"Mujhe woh analogy pasand hai. Acchi soch hai. Yeh sochna hai, Bruce. Yeh bahut achcha hai. Wah. Toh hum saaransh mein, aaj, tum aaye, thodi taraqqi ki, par tumhare kuch rukawat the. Tumne faisla kiya hai ki chahe baarish ho ya dhup, tum bhaagoge kyunki tumhare paas raincoat hai aur tum apne positive doston ka swaagat karenge jinke saath tum saath hote huye ek khushiyaan bhari zindagi jeeyoge aur aane waale kuch aur asar daalne waale doston ki jagah ek naya janwar paalne ki sochoge, kya, saanp ya phir woh aur kya tha?"
81,"Oh, fish. Yeah.",routine,70_81,P,id,,"अरे, मछली. हाँ"
82," Okay. And in terms of a support group, I will send you a list of support groups. And you feel that on a scale of one to 10, that you're about an eight, and actually carrying through and trying out two of these support groups, because of the hockey team analogy. Great job. So overall, how would you rate today's session? ",story,70_82,T,yq,,"Okay. Aur agar baat karein ek support group ki, main aapse ek list bhej dunga jahan aapko madad mil sakti hai. Aur aapko lagta hai ki aap ek ek se das tak hain, toh aap do support groups ko try karein, kyunki hockey team ka analogy istemaal karke. Bahut achha kaam kiya aapne. Toh overall, aaj ki session ko aap kis level par rate karenge?"
83,"It was good, very good.",routine,70_83,P,ack,,"Yeh accha tha, bahut accha tha."
84,"And if we were to put it on a scale of one to 10,",routine,70_84,T,irq,,Agar hum ise ek se das tak ke scale par rakhenge toh

91,summary,"The patient has had a positive urine test analysis for marijuana. The therapist and patient were working on ways to cut down or extinguish marijuana altogether. The patient did not exercise by running because it was raining and this resulted in more usage of marijuana. On therapist's nudge, the patient agrees they could use a raincoat and ensure they go for running. They did not want to hurt their friends' feelings and hence ended up hanging out with them and using marijuana. The patient rates three out of ten for motivation to meet friends who don't use marijuana. The patient recalls outdoor activities and healthy lifestyle with these friends. The therapist discusses another option to take a pet and is left to patient to decide on the animal they can relate to. The therapist clarifies the postive effects of support group in improving abstinence, and brings analogy with a hockey team as the patient plays hockey. The patient rates eight on ten of attending a support group. The patient rates the therapy session as eight on ten. ",,,,,
