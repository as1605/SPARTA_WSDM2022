1,I was a nurse for 44 years.,routine,99_1,P,id,,<m>Lag rahi thi main 44 saal tak ek nurse ke rup mein.</m>
2,Okay. And it was up that kept you very busy.,routine,99_2,T,crq,,Thik hai. Aur yeh up ka hi kaam hai jo tujhe kaafi vyast rakhta hai.
3,"It did it did. It wasn't just that I had five children and I helped my husband run of post office. So I was working 70 hours a week in those days because I did two nights night duty they were 12 hour shifts separated. And and then I worked in the shop. So several jobs. So for five years I did that so that was you know, and looked after the children in the house in that year.",story,99_3,P,cd,,"Vo maine kiya kiya. Yeh sirf yeh nahi tha ki mere paas paanch bachche the aur maine bhi apne pati ko post office chalane mein madad ki. Isliye maare dino mein main 70 ghante kaam kar rahi thi kyu ki maine do raat raat ke duty ki, jo 12 ghante ke shifts the. Fir mai dukkan mein bhi kaam karti thi. Kaafi sare naukri hote the. Toh paanch saal tak maine yeh sab kiya tha. Aur iske alawa bachcho aur ghar ka dhyan rakhti thi uss saal."
4,"Any now that you retired, you do do any voluntary work or",routine,99_4,T,yq,,"Ab aap retired hai, kya aap koi doondh ki seva ya kisee bhi tarah ka karyakram kar rahe hai?"
5,"Yeah, I've got involved with things around the church with visiting the house bound and taking them out and things like that. And I still am one of my daughters decided to get me a job as a transport passenger assistant for special needs. On the many buses that go around needs. Yeah. So they were desperate for them. And she said, you'll be good at that mum. So that was signed you up. She signed me up. Because she worked. She was the manager. So I did that until I was 77. And I also did they 11 weeks of the stewarding for the abrsm music exams.",story,99_5,P,id,,"Haan, maine dekha ki rehti hooN par mujhe gar maarte umalte, yeh sab aur kaam me lag gaya hoon. Waise meri ek beti ne socha ki mujhe vishesh jarurat waaloN ke liye passenger asisstant ka kaam mile. Bahut gaadiyan waaloN ko apartment ke mukaam pe le jaatee the. Haan. Toh unka bohot zarurat thi. Aur woh boli, tum iss mein ache se kaam karoge. Isliye maine haan keh diya. Unhone mujhe sign kiya. Woh kaam karti thi. Phir maine woh kaam kiya jab tak main 77 saal na ho gayi. Aur maine 11 haftoN tak abrsm music exams ke liye stewarding ka kaam kiya."
6,Yeah. And Have you always been like that?,routine,99_6,T,yq,,Haan. Aur kya aap hamesha aise hi rahe hain?
7,"Yeah, yeah.",routine,99_7,P,op,,"Haan, haan."
8,Do you Have a lot of social support.,routine,99_8,T,yq,,Kya tumhare paas bahut saari samaajik sahayata hai?
9,"Yes, I do. Yeah. Yeah. Well, even more so now now that the children have press gang me into Facebook and WhatsApp. Wow. I mean, it's just, it's just full on around the world now, you know?",symp/reasoning,99_9,P,id,,"Haan, mujhe bhi. Haan. Haan. Accha, ab bacho ne mujhe Facebook aur WhatsApp mein shamil karvadiya hai, isiliye aur bhi zyada. Wah. Matlab, ab to ye poora duniya bhar mein chal raha hai, pata hai tumhe?"
10,"You international? Yes, yes. Yes. And I believe that you are an Airbnb host.",symp/reasoning,99_10,T,irq,,"Kya tum international ho? Haan, haan. Haan. Aur main maanta hu ki tum ek Airbnb host ho."
11,Yes I do. Yeah. So the world comes to me that way. Excellent.,routine,99_11,P,id,1.0,Haan main karta hoon. Haan. Toh duniya mujhe uss tareeke se aati hai. Badiya.

14,And you said you've got grandchildren and great grandchildren. Do you think that intergenerational contact is important?,routine,99_14,T,orq,,Aur tumne kaha ki tumhare paas poti-pote se badhkar pota-poti hai. Kya tumhe lagta hai ki ek pidh se dusri pidh tak ka sampark mahatvapurna hai?
15,Very important.,routine,99_15,P,od,,Bahut hi mahatvapurn
16,Why?,routine,99_16,T,irq,,Kyun?
17,"Because you when you bring up children, you haven't time to see the world through their eyes. Or even really listen to them because you're too busy and preoccupied, but then grandchildren come along and more importantly now great grandchildren and seeing the world fresh through these new eyes is just it's quite mind blowing actually. So I've learned a lot. In the old days, grandchildren used to learn the grandparents knee but nowadays it's the grandparents learning at the grandchildren's knees now definitely Oh, yes.",story,99_17,P,id,,"Kyunki jab aap bachche ko pal rahe ho, tab aapki paas unki ankhon se duniya ko dekhne ka waqt nahi hota. Aur unko dhyan se sunne ke liye bhi aapka waqt nahi hota kyunki aapka dhyan aur samay doosre kaam mein laga rehta hai. Par jab potey aur potiyon ki paidaishi rahti hai tab, zara aur jaruri hai bigdaron ko dekhna kyunki un naye ankhon se duniya ki dekhna ekdam kalakh rahne wali batein hoti hai. Isiliye maine bahutkuch sekha hai. Pehle toh potey potiyon ki godh mein sikhne wale the, lekin ab shayad hum boodon ki godh mein sikhte hain, hain na?"
18,Yes. And do you think it also benefits them to spend time with people of different different generations different ages?,routine,99_18,T,orq,,"""Haan. Aur kya aapko lagta hai ki ye unhe bhi fayde pahuchata hai jab wo alag alag peedhiyon, alag alag umar ke logon ke saath samay bitate hain?"""
19,"Well, as I said they don't see it use age you see, yeah, which is very releasing. Because Well, it just is, you know, after the my generation the way I was brought up, to be seen and not heard and to sit in the parlor with a all these old people. And now, money going around flipping parks, you know, they adventure things and they're saying, Come on the slide with us and all this, you know, which I do. Which I do, I don't turn anything down. That's the secret.",story,99_19,P,od,,"Well, jaise maine kaha tha ki wo isse umr ko nahi dekhte, you know, jo bahut azaad karta hai. Kyunki well, yeh toh hota hi hai, pata hai, meri generation ke baad, jaise mere upbringing hua tha, dikhaayi diye bina baithna and old logon ke saath parlour mein baithna. Aur ab, paisa ghoom raha hai flip karte hue, you know, adbhut cheezon pe ja rahe hain aur bolte hain, chalo humare saath slide pe. Aur yeh sab, meri aadat hai. Jo main karta hun, maine kabhi bhi mana nahi kiya. Yeh meri raaz hai."
20,not turning things down. Yeah.,routine,99_20,T,crq,,na chhuna cheezein. Haan.
21,"Just always say yes. Yes. Good philosophy, except drugs, try everything. Try everything once.",symp/reasoning,99_21,P,cd,,"Bas jald hi haan kaho. Haan. Achhi darshanikta, keval drugs ke saath, sab kuch try karo. Ek baar sab kuch try karo."
22,"What's your view on nutrition and kind of, you know, having a healthy diet?",routine,99_22,T,orq,,Tumhare kya sochoge nutrition ke baare mein aur kis tarah se ek swasth aahar ka sevan karna hai?
23,"I think I think the younger generation stress on it too much, far too much. When when do you think that if my generation are living to be 100 and we were brought up with dripping sandwiches, maybe With marbling in blah, etc, etc, full cream milk, all the rest of it. Why get stressed out? You know, just eat everything in moderation and enjoy life for goodness sake.",routine,99_23,P,od,,"Mujhe lagta hai ki yeh naye pidhi zyada tarpari deti hai, bahut jyada. Jab jab tum sochte ho ki agar meri pidhi 100 saal tak jee sakti hai aur hum jam vali sandwich aur bland fat, ityadi se bade huye hai, pure doodh, sab kuchh. Toh kyu pareshan ho jaate ho? Tum jaante ho na, bas sab kuchh had se zyada na khaao aur khushi se jeene do, bhagwan ke liye."
24,"Yeah. I quite like that phiosophy How do you minimize the effects of stress? Do you have any, you know, did you have any techniques or if something stressful happens? Is there anything particular that you do?",routine,99_24,T,yq,,Haan. Mujhe woh darshan kaafi pasand hai. Aap ya duniya bartano ko kam karne ka tarika pata hai? Aur ya kuchh aise darasal dehan karne hai ki aap ko koi afsos ho? Kya aap kuchh khaas karte hai?
25,"gin and tonic Oh, okay. I've got a very good thing if I'm really cross with somebody, and I'd really like to speak my mind to them. I'm very good at writing letters. I don't send the letter to them. But I do write it down and get it out of my system. And I keep it in a drawer in case one day, I might need to plunk it down in front of them. But it's You know, it's off, it's out of my head. And if I need to go to the doctor about anything, I will write down what I want to say to him, because I don't believe they listen to you all the time, especially a woman, if it's a man, Doctor, but you know, whichever they think, Oh, god, it's her again, you know? So I think, put this down and smile at him. He's got to read it.",story,99_25,P,id,,"Gin and tonic Arre, thik hai. Mere paas ek bahut acchi cheez hai agar main kisi ke saath gussa ho, aur main sachmuch unse apni baat karna chahta hu. Main letter likhne mein bahut accha hu. Main letter unhe bhejta nahi hu. Lekin main letter likh leta hu aur apne system se nikalta hu. Aur main use ek drawer mein rakhta hu kyunki koi din mujhe zarurat pad sakti hai usko unke saamne rakhne ki. Par yeh aapko pata hain, yeh mere dimaag se bahar nikal chuka hain. Aur agar kisi chiz ke liye doctor ke paas jaana pade, main use likh deta hu jo main usse kehna chahta hu, kyunki mujhe lagta hai woh har waqt aapki baat nahi sunte, especially ek aurat ho, agar ek mard doctor ho, lekin aap jaante hain, jaise woh sochte hain, oh, bhagwan, yeh phir se uske paas hain, pata nahi kya milega iss baar, pata hai na? Toh main sochta hu, ise likh dalo aur uspe muskurao. Woh padhna hi padega."
26,"I think you're in your 70s. Do you enjoy being in your 70s? What was your favorite period of you know, in life? If you can, if there's an answer to that?",routine,99_26,T,yq,,"Main sochta hu ki aap apney saattees kee hai. Kya aapko saattees kee umar mein anand aata hai? Aapki zindagi mein aapka sabse pasandeeda samay kya hai? Agar aap chahein toh, agar iska koi jawaab hai?"
27,"No, there isn't. You should just enjoy every day as it comes and not get hung up about age. Yeah, because I'm surrounded by 90 year olds now. And honestly, they're like, nine years old. We have the biggest laughs and they do the silliest things and you know, we feel as if we've been set free from actual age  You know, you're a mother set an example to the children, right? Oh, you're a daughter, you know?",story,99_27,P,id,,"Nahi, koi nahi hai. Aapko bas har din ka anand lete rahna chahiye aur umar ke bare mein pareshan na ho. Kyunki ab mere aas paas 90 saal ke umr ke log hain. Aur sach kahu to woh toh nau saal ke bachhe hi hain. Hum sabse zyada Hans lete hain aur woh muft mein sabse bade paagalpan karte hain aur aap pata hai, hum jaise lagta hai ki hume asli umar se mukti mil gayi hai. Aap jante hain, aap maa hain, bachho ko ek udaahran set karni chahiye, sahi? Oh, aap beti hain, aap jante hain na?"
28,So do you think it makes a difference? kind of moving on from those responsibilities kind of times of life. So when you when you are looking after your children? Is that what you mean by you feel a sense of relief later?,routine,99_28,T,orq,,"To kya tumhe lagta hai ki yeh farak padta hai? thoda aage badhkar, zimmedariyon ke bhar se jeevan ke us samay par. To jab tum apne baccho ka khayal rakhti ho? Kya tum isse matlab karte ho ki baad mein tumhe chain ki ehsaas hoti hai?"
29,"Yes. Because you're not, no one's judging you. Except that you're hanging around too long. But apart from that, yeah, no, it's it's good. I mean, I was brought up by a Victorian father who was a bank manager. And it was always just remember who I am in this town. You know, they were somebody in those days. You're my children. And, and then I went to a convent grammar. Just remember who you are girls, your convent grammar school girl, you know, so it didn't leave much to send it It didn't leave much pressure to Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, there's all these pressures as you're going through life. So it's nice to be and my husband died in his 50s so I had to reinvent myself, which was scary. Very scary after being a wife and mother all those years but my goodness me,",story,99_29,P,id,,"Haan hai. Kyunki tu ne nahi kiya hai, koi tujhe judge nahi kar raha hai. Bas wohi ke tu bahot der se time naa waste kar. Lekin uske alava, haan, nahi, yeh sahi hai. Mera matlab, mera Victorian father ek bank manager the aur mujhe hamesha yaad rakhna hota tha ki main iss sheher mein kaun hu. Tum jante ho, woh uss zamane mein kisi the. Tum meri bachche ho. Fir main ek convent grammar mein gayi. Yaad rakhna hota tha ki tum kaun ho ladkiya, tum convent grammar school ki ladki ho, tum jante ho. Toh usse zyada toh kuch bachta hi nahi tha kya dikhane ko. Haan. Haan. Toh haan, jaise jaise zindagi mein aage badhti hai, waha saare pressure hote hai. Isiliye achcha laga ki main apne aap ko dubara se banayi, mere pati ke death ke baad, joki unke pachass ke hi umar mein ho gaya tha, bahot darr tha. Bahot darr kiya. Ek patni aur maa hone ke baad, itne saalon tak, apne aap ko dubara se khojna, lekin mere toh bhagwan malum."
30,I think it was either earlier this year or last year you did something quite big for a stranger.,routine,99_30,T,irq,,Mujhe lagta hai ki ya toh is saal ya pichhle saal tumne kisi anjaan vyakti ke liye bahut bada kaam kiya tha.

35,"I found out on Facebook, okay. Don't ask me what the heading was but I'm already like most people donated after death. You know everything. I mean, I'm leaving my body to leave medical school as well, which hasn't pleased one of my daughters, but there you go. How can we agree with you? You're still hanging around? She said. So. So yes, so some of them were for it. And some of them, some of them weren't",story,99_35,P,id,,"Mujhe pata chal gaya Facebook pe, teekhai. Mere se title ka puch mat kar, but mai already logo ki tarah mere marne ke baad donate kardunga. Tum sab jaante ho.

38,"Yeah,",routine,99_38,T,ack,,"Haan,"
39,"it was, it was better than 1000 mile service. And I thought, well, I'm doing this for the right reasons. I know that, but who knows, they might find something totally wrong with me. And that's the way I found out so it's a win win situation, I believe. Yeah. And you know that if they do accept you, and I was the oldest one that they've ever had this and it'll last 20 years. Apparently, a kidney can last 20 years. That Yeah, that was good. Yeah. So So win win",story,99_39,P,id,,"Yeh toh tha, yeh 1000 mile service se behtar tha. Aur maine socha, theek hai, main sahi wajah se kar raha hoon. Yeh mujhe pata hai, par kaun jaane, woh mere mein kuch galat dikhate hain. Aur mujhe yahi tarika mila isliye yeh ek jeet jeet ki sthiti hai, main manaata hoon. Han. Aur tum jaante ho ki agar woh tumhe maan leten hai, aur main sabse puraana hoon jinhe kabhi bhi iska honsla diya gaya hai aur yeh 20 saal tak chalega. Pta nai ki 20 saal tak kidney tikti hai. Han, yeh accha tha. Han. Toh jeet jeet."

41,"Well, I think if you can do something for somebody else for whatever reason, however tiny the comeback to yourself is, is just huge. But as long as you don't look for that comeback, but it just, it just is Yeah. And it also consolidates the reason why you're still alive that you know that you're not just taking up space on the planet. And that, you know, you should do something nice in January hopefully, tanden, Parrish Don't for Alzheimer's. So that's the plan we're animating",routine,99_41,P,id,,"Achha, main sochta hun ki agar aap kisi ke liye kuch kar sakte hain, chahe koi bhi wajah ho, chota bhi sa aapko fayda ho lekin bahut bada hota hai. Par jab tak aap us fayde ki talash na karein, bas woh hai. Aur yeh bhi siddh karta hai ki aap zinda hain aur aap sirf dharti par jagah nahi le rahe hain. Aur yeh hai vah wajah ki aap January mein kuch accha na karein, taki Alzheimer's ke liye kuch karein. To yeh hai hamara yojana, hum animation kar rahe hain."

Well, one You don't know how long you're here four and two nobody's that important to you know, the world you're not the center of the universe for goodness sake, you know, so just get on with things and it's like, I feel sorry with Facebook, you know, if they don't get enough likes, you know, it was ruin the day some people well, this is all false. It smoke and mirrors. One thing a friend did say to me that was very important and very proudly was saying that I now own my own house, you see? And she just laughed and she said, Do you think it really? night? Yes. You know? Oh, you taking it with you? Oh, yeah. She said if you don't own anything, she said it's smoke and mirrors all of it. Yeah, and it's true, isn't it? Yeah. So just laughing get over there.",story,99_43,P,id,,"Haan. Wow. Haan. Haan, woh theek hona chahiye. Jeevan ko itni gamjhili nazariye se na le, na? Well, ek baat You pata nahi kitna arsa yaha hain aur do, koi bhi aapke liye itna important nahi hai na, duniya mein aap duniya ka center nahi ho for goodness sake, aapko pata nahi, to bas kaam par jao. Facebook ke saath aisa lagta hai, pata nahi, unhe milne waale likes pata nahi, unke din kharaab kardega kuch log 'bas, ye sab jhooth hai. Ye sab kojh samne karne ka ek vaargikaran hai. Ek cheez ek dost ne mujhe kahi thi jo bahut mahatvapurn thi aur mujhe badi khushi se keh rahi thi ke ab to main apne ghar ki maalkin hu, samjhe? Aur woh bas hass rahi thi aur keh rahi thi, kya tum sach mein aisa hote ho? Raat me bhi? Haan. Pata nahi? Oh, tum saath leke jaaoge? Haan, balki wo khud se keh rahi thi ki agar kuch bhi tumhara nahi hai, to ye sab kojh hai. Haan, aur sach hai na? Haan. To bas hase jaao aur iss baat se bahar niklo."
