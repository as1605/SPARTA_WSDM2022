Aur mujhe lag raha tha ki mera dil daud raha hai. Mujhe aisa lag raha tha jaise mere haath kanpte ho. Aur main test par concentrate nahi kar pa raha tha. Haan ki raat humari friend ne mujhe practice questions diye the, aur main saare sawaalon ka jawab jaanta tha, lekin proper tareeke se nahi, aur mujhe koi sawaal bhi galat nahi tha."

And I had to pass this test in order to move to the next grade. And I thought just like this test that I was ready for it, I had a tutor, and I felt really prepared for it. And then when I took it, I failed. And I was held back. And I feel like, you know, that was so it was, it was really embarrassing for me to be held back. And I felt like I don't want to say but I did feel like a failure at the time. Because I felt like I really didn't know this. I don't know why I couldn't pass the test.",symp/reasoning,163_23,P,od,-1.0,"Accha, maine hamesha tests ke saath thoda ladaai ki hai.

Lekin jab maine liya, main fika. Aur main wapis rakh diya gaya. Aur main aisa mahsoos kar raha tha, ki aap jaante hain, ye bahut sharm ki baat hai mujh par rok diya. Aur main lagta hai ki, aap jaante hain, main waqt par ek naakaam saamay se mehsoos kar raha tha. Kyunki main lagta tha ki mujhe sach mein nahi pata keh rahe the.

27,"Yes, I always feel really anxious. I mean, I'm able to pass tests obviously because I graduated from college. School went on to high school.

Lekin mere liye bahut mushkil hota hai kyunki mujhe iss chinta ki vajah se woh bhi, shayad mujhe lagta hai ki main usse jaanta hoon, par phir bhi pariksha mein fail ho jau, jaise pehle kabhi hua tha."

37,"I think it's just the fact that it's this promotion. So it's like the same thing. Like, if I fail, I'm being held back. And I feel like it's, we live in that moment of being held back. And that, that that's like a fear that I have that, um, that by not being able to pass these tests are holding me back.",symp/reasoning,163_37,P,gc,-1.0,"Mujhe lagta hai yeh bs yeh baat hai ki yeh promotion hai.

Aur yeh, yeh ek darr hai jo mujhe hai ki, um, ki yeh tests pass karne mein nakam hone se mujhe peeche hold kar rahe hai."
38,So it really that same feeling you've had in third grade. That's coming up with this test.,story,163_38,T,crq,0.0,Toh yeh thik uss wahi ehsaas ki baat hai jo aapne tisre shabd mein mehsoos kiya tha. Yeh wahi hai jisse is test ko taiyaar kiya hai.

",story,163_46,T,gc,0.0,"Haan, toh yeh hai ki yeh pressure hai, ki tumhe yeh pressure hai ki tum isse paar karna chahte ho. Aur tumhare paas woh suraksha jaale nahi hai jo tumhe school mein the?"
47,"Yeah, if I fail it, then I'm not going to be able to get the promotion, I would have to wait. Just like I did not have to wait a certain amount of time. I think an ear before I could take it again.",story,163_47,P,op,-1.0,"Haan, agar main ismein nakami hoti hai, to mujhe udharan ke promotion nahi milne waale, mujhe shayaad intezaar karna padega.

So I'm curious as to what you think about what core beliefs may be operating. For you now with this with this test, this work test",inactive,163_60,T,gc,0.0,So main mere kuch kuch vichar is vishay par hain. Ek toh mere man mein yeh sawaal uth raha hai ki hum pehle bhi baat kar chuke hain manasik chikitsa ke mool man se sambandhit vishwaas ke baare mein. Iss par main janna chahta hoon ki aap is test ke saath abhi kya mool man wale vishwaas chal rahe hain ya nahi.

65,"I mean, that's what scares me. That's, that's exactly the thought that I'm thinking when I'm about to take the test. And if I don't pass that, it's just gonna have like this domino effect of failure.",story,163_65,P,gc,-1.0,"Mai mera matlab hai, yehi toh mujhe darrata hai. Yehi soch hai jo mujhe yaad aati hai jab mein test dene ke liye taiyaar hota hoon. Aur agar mein woh test clear na kar saku, toh iss se ek ek karke failure ka ghar-barbaad hone ka asar hoga."
66,"Okay, so it could be a core belief, but it's also seems like you're still on that thought. Like as you get ready to take that test. You're thinking I'm just destined to be a failure. ",routine,163_66,T,gc,0.0,"Theek ho, toh yeh ek mukhya vishwaas ho sakta hai, lekin yeh bhi lagta hai ki tum abhi bhi usi vichaar mein hote ho. Jaise hi tum woh pariksha dene ke liye taiyaar ho.

67,Yeah.,inactive,163_67,P,ack,-1.0,Hanji.
68,And you're having what sounds like a panic response to heart racing.,routine,163_68,T,irq,0.0,"Aur tumhare paas jo panic jaisa lag raha hai, wo dil ki jhor jhor se reaction ho raha hai."

71,"Yes, ",symp/reasoning,163_71,P,op,0.0,"Haan,"
72,you are. So no one's really seeing you have this. I wouldn't want to call it a panic attack yet we haven't really gotten too far into it. But it sounds like it has some panic like features.,symp/reasoning,163_72,T,gc,0.0,Tum ho. To koi tumhe nahi dekh raha hai jab tum isme ho. Main chahta nahi ki ise ek panic attack kehte huye bhi hum isme bahut aage badh gaye hai. Lekin yeh lagta hai ki isme kuch panic jaise guna hai.
73,Yeah.,symp/reasoning,163_73,P,gc,0.0,Achha
74,"Because it's not. It's interfering with you thinking clearly enough to get to the items. So, okay. So one thought I have is you have you ever had panic attacks in the past or anything like this?, the third grade thing?",symp/reasoning,163_74,T,gc,0.0,"Iske vajah se yeh hai. Yah aapke vichaar karne mein asaafal hai ki aap cheezon tak pahunchne mein madad kar araha hai. To theek hai. Ek vichaar kiya hai ki kya aap pehle kabhi panic attacks ya aise kuch hua hai?, teesre grade wali baat?"
75,"No, not really. I mean, sometimes I get worked out when I'm about to take a test, okay, but it's only around test.",symp/reasoning,163_75,P,id,-1.0,"Nahi, sach me nahi. Matlab, kabhi kabhi mujhe kaam se taiyar hone par gussa ata hai, thik hai, par sirf test ke aaspas."
76,And what happens once you get worked up like once your heart rate increases and You have any other physiological symptoms would,symp/reasoning,163_76,T,irq,0.0,Aur kya hota hai jab aap ek baar garam ho jaate hai jaise ki aapka dil ka rate bhadta hai aur kuch aur sharirik lakshan aate hai?
77,want to actually do take the test?,routine,163_77,P,crq,0.0,क्या आप वास्तव में टेस्ट लेना
78,hmmm,routine,163_78,T,cd,0.0,Is baat

80,"So one one possible strategy here is we talked about the adaptive response. Right? So, which is that thought that you say to yourself that self talk, I wonder if your doctor response couldn't be I can ride this out like you have no time to test? ",routine,163_80,T,gc,0.0,"So ek ek possible strategy jo yahan ho sakta hai woh hai ki hum adaptive response ke baare mein baat ki. Sahi? Toh, jo ki woh vichaar hai jisko aap apne aap se kehte hain, wohi soch, kya aapke doctor ki response yeh nahi ho sakti ki aap isko handle kar sakte hain jaise aapke paas test karne ka time hi nahi hai?"
81,"Yeah, that's true. ",routine,163_81,P,cd,0.0,"Haan, wahi sach hai."
82,"I mean, the panic responses only maintained for so long",routine,163_82,T,gc,0.0,"Mera matlab hai, ghabraahat ke jawaab sirf itna hi samay tak jari rahe"
83,and I could also choose like maybe questions that are no the answer to automatically so that could help maybe release some of that stress,routine,163_83,P,gc,-1.0,"Aur main be choices kar sakti hu, jaise ki wo sawaal jo sahi uttar nahi hai toh maybe automatically wo select ho jaaye, jisse meri stress kam ho sakta hai."
84,"to get some in a sense to get some minor victories under your belt by like, answering those right you know, you're closer to achieving your goal",routine,163_84,T,gc,0.0,"Apne lakshya tak pahunchne ke liye kuch chhote se jit hasil karne ka ek sense hota hai, jaise ki, sahi jawab dene ke madhyam se, aap apne lakshya ke karib aate hain."
85,"yes and then I feel like I know, at least I know that like, Don't validate the feeling that I maybe I can pass this test.",routine,163_85,P,gc,-1.0,"Haan phir mujhe esa lagta hai ke main jaanta hai, kam se kam main jaanta hu ki, Is ahsaas ko nahi manana jo mujhe lag raha hai ke shayad main iss test ko pa sakta hu."
86,"So the more items you you answer correctly, the less anxious you're gonna feel because you're closer to the end of.",routine,163_86,T,crq,0.0,"Toh jitne bhi sawal aap sahi jawab doge, utni hi kam chinta hogi kyunki aap ant ke nazdik pahunch rahe honge."
87,"Yeah, definitely. Because then I start to feel more calm because I know that I know these questions are definitely going to be right.",routine,163_87,P,cd,-1.0,"Yeah, pakka. Kyunki fir mujhe aaram mahsus hone lagta hai kyonki main jaanta hoon ki ye sawaal bilkul sahi honge."
88,"So that's so that's one well, that's a cognitive and behavioral strategy, right? Like you can you can wait out the panic. I mean, you're in the room alone.",routine,163_88,T,gc,0.0,"Toh woh toh ek acha hai, woh ek cognitive aur behavioral strategy hai na? Jaise ki aap panic ko bardasht kar sakte hain. Yaani ki aap akela kamre mein hain."
89,"Yeah, that's true. Nobody's there. Nobody's gonna see me. I'm kind of trying to get myself together. ",routine,163_89,P,gc,-1.0,"Haan, wahi sach hai. Koi nahi hai. Koi mujhe dekhega bhi nahi. Main koshish kar raha hu apne aap ko sambhalane ki."
90,"Yeah. Now the panic painful. Right, the you know, the panic symptoms are painful. So what you could tell yourself is, this isn't pleasant. But I can write out these symptoms because they only last so long. ",routine,163_90,T,orq,0.0,"Haan. Ab panic dardnak hai. Theek hai, tum jaante ho, panic ke lakshan dardnak hote hain. Toh kya tum apne aap se keh sakte ho ki, yeh sukhi nahi hai. Lekin main in lakshano ko likh sakti hoon kyun ki woh sirf thode samay ke liye hote hain."
91,"Probabiy, I could use like self talk. ",routine,163_91,P,od,-1.0,"""Ho sakta hai, main apne aap se baat kar sakta hu."""
92,"Exactly. Yeah, because usually mean peg symptoms can run you know, five minutes. 10 minutes, 15 minutes. But you have no time limit? ",routine,163_92,T,gc,0.0,"ठीक है। हां, क्योंकि आमतौर पर मतली के लक्षण आपको पता होते हैं, पांच मिनट, दस मिनट, पंद्रह मिनट तक चल सकते ह"
93,"Yeah,",routine,163_93,P,cd,0.0,"Haan,"
94,"yeah so if you can just kind of use that time to focus on the items, as you mentioned, you could get right. And kind of, at the same time be telling yourself I can ride this out.",story,163_94,T,gc,0.0,"Haan agar aap mujhe kuch samay de sake toh aap saman par dhyan concentrate kar sakte hain, jaise ki aapne kaha, aap sidhe ho sakte hain.

95,"Yeah, I mean, I've done that in the past, so I can apply it to this test. ",story,163_95,P,id,0.0,"Haan, main mera matlab, maine pichhle mein woh kiya hua hai, isliye main is test mein uska upyog kar sakti hoon."
96,So if that's worked for you that ?,routine,163_96,T,crq,0.0,"Ae agar tere liye woh kaam kar gaya hai, toh kya?"
97,"yes, that has worked and I passed. ",routine,163_97,P,cd,1.0,"Haan, yeh kaam kar gaya aur main paas ho gaya."
98,"So that's, that's certainly that's certainly one adaptive response to try writing. Another one could be that, although it wouldn't be great to fail, you can retake the test in a year. Right. You could try it. ",inactive,163_98,T,gc,0.0,"Toh yehi, yehi toh ek adaptive jawab hai likhne ko koshish karne ki. Dusra yeh ho sakta hai ki, waise fail hona accha nahi hoga, lekin aap ek saal baad test phir le sakte hain. Sahi hai. Aap koshish kar sakte hain."
99,"Yeah, that's true.",inactive,163_99,P,gc,0.0,"Haan, wo bilkul sahi hai."
100,"I mean, I know that's not what you want, but, but the alternative is kind of buying into that automatic thought we know that's not working. Right. The I'm I'm Destin, that was the word right like I'm destined to be a failure. We know that's not working for you. ",inactive,163_100,T,gc,0.0,"Main, I understand ki yeh aapka dil kahta hai ki yeh woh nahi hai jo aap chahte hain, lekin, lekin uska dusra vikalp sehtiya hai ki aap us soch pe bharosa kar rahe hain jo kisi ke liye kaam nahi karta hai. Sahi hai na. Wahi main hu, main hu, Destin, yehi shabd the na jaise ke main ek nakami ka nishchit hoon. Hum jaante hain ki yeh aapke liye kaam nahi kar raha hai."
101,"So even if I have to take the test again and in a year, then I'm not going to be a failure because I still have the chance to take it again. It's not like I'll never be able to take this test again.",inactive,163_101,P,gc,-1.0,"Agar main phir se aur ek saal mein yeh pariksha lena padega, toh bhi main haar nahi maanoonga kyunki mujhe phir se iska mauka milega. Yeh yun nahi hai ki main kabhi bhi yeh pariksha nahi le sakunga."
102,"Yeah, you just have, you just have another years of study, right? And, of course, you wouldn't have that promotion that time and that would be an outcome, I know you don't want. But it's not the end of your career, It's not like something so drastic it's important to you and I can appreciate that. But it's not the end of your career. You're not going to be unemployed.",inactive,163_102,T,gc,0.0,"Haan, abhi aapke paas aur ek saal ka padhai ka waqt hai, sahi hai na? Aur, of course, aapko tabhi wo promotion nahi milega aur wo ek nateeja hoga, main jaanta hoon aapko uska koi khaas shauk nahi hai. Lekin aapki kariyer ka anth nahi hai, iski koi badi baat nahi hai jo aapke liye ahem ho aur main samajh sakta hoon. Lekin aapki kariyer ka anth nahi hai, aap berozgaar nahi honge."
103,"No, no, definitely not. And just thinking back and relating it back to the third grade, even though I had to stay back. I still managed to, you know, do well the next year and keep moving up. And it hasn't really, in the long run prevented me from doing anything that I've wanted to do.",story,163_103,P,gc,-1.0,"Nahi nahi, definitely nahin. Aur yaad karke teesri kaksha se judne ke baad jo bhi laga, maine uske baad bhi jhela. Main phir bhi, aapko pata hai, agle saal achhe se kaam kiya aur aage badha. Aur isne, lambi daud mein mujhe kisi bhi cheez se rok nahin paya jo main karna chahta tha."
104,"So that's great. That's another adaptive response, which you've survived this before.",story,163_104,T,gc,0.0,"Toh woh toh badiya hai. Yeh ek aur prati adaptive prativad hai, jiske aap pehle se bache hue hain."
105,"Yes, I definitely have.",routine,163_105,P,gc,0.0,"Haan, maine bilkul kiya hai."
106,"So this one event, I mean, I had the the incident third grade with the unpleasant experience but this one event you don't want that this kind of fashion. While use your word, your destiny by like this was one that seemed to catch you off guard but the the panic like symptoms. And fortunately your employer is going to give you the chance to retake and try this again. And, and I met you know, so you have I imagine you could you can write out these, these symptoms. And I think you have the other adaptive response, which is I've been successful this before.",routine,163_106,T,gc,0.0,"Is ek baar, yaad hai, meri aathvi kaksha me ghatna ghat gayi thi lekin aisa ek mauka tha jo aap nahi chahte the ki aapka koi bhi asa fashion dekhe. Iske alawa, jab aap apne dimaag ke shabd istemaal karte the to aapka bhavishya achanak aisa lagta tha jaisa ki aap anjaan the lekin dar bhi ane lage the. Aur khushkismati se aapke employer ko aage jaake aapko yeh mauka dene keliye taiyar ho gaye. Aur mein aapse milke, mujhe pata hai, aap in dikkatvahu lakshano ko likh sakoge. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki aapme dusra jeevanushilan pratikriya hai, iska matlab ki aap pehle bhi isse safal ho chuke ho."
107,"Yeah. I mean, definitely I feel a lot better now because I just know that no matter what happens, I've been here before, and I can get through it as opposed to like that feeling that I'm going to just fail together.",routine,163_107,P,gc,-1.0,"Haan. Main toh sahi mein bahut acha mehsoos kar raha hoon ab kyunki mujhe pata hai ki chahe kuch bhi ho jaaye, main pehle se yahan hoon aur main usse paar kar sakta hoon, maaf kijiye par woh feeling nahi hai ki main bas haar jaungi."

Okay, which is just taking this test taking one item at a time and fighting through some of these physical symptoms you're having, and fighting through the useful thoughts.",symp/reasoning,163_112,T,gc,0.0,"Aur hum iss baat pe dhyaan denge ki aapke paas ye adaptive responses ho aur aap taiyaar ho jaayein. Thik hai. Aur hum sach mein aapke upar positive prabhav dalne ki koshish karenge. Theek hai, jisme aap iss test ko ek ek item ke saath lenge aur kuch sharirik lakshanon se lad kar aage badhenge, aur faydemand vichaar se bhi ladenge."
