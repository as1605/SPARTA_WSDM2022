20,"Sandra, having just explore some of your feelings around the situation you have, I'm going to suggest that you speak to Jeff on an empty chair. This may be a little uncomfortable. But it helped me to facilitate a process where I become an observer, and you'll be in dialoguing with a party that you are actually having to deal with. And I'll be facilitating for you the process and then pointing out some of the things that we could do to change process okay. It's been Jeff and your imagination that the massive Jeff we're here. I'll bring a chair. Okay. Welcome, Jeff. I mean I welcome Jeff. And, and there's Jeff. Imagine his face looks like how you remember him and bring him in and your fantasy. And then when you're ready to just say whatever comes to you at that moment, this moment spontaneous.",symp/reasoning,197_20,T,id,,"सांड्रा, जो तुम्हारे विचारों को अन्वेषण किया है, मैं तुम्हे सुझाव दूँगा कि तुम खाली कुर्सी पर जेफ से बात करो। यह थोड़ा असहज हो सकता है। लेकिन इससे मैंने उस प्रक्रिया को सुगम बनाने में मदद की है जहां मैं एक दर्शक बनता हूँ, और आप उस पक्ष के साथ बातचीत करते हो। और मैं आपके लिए उस प्रक्रिया को सुविधाजनक बनाने में मदद करूंगा और फिर हम उसके बाद कुछ फेलाने वाली बातें दिखाएंगे जो हम कुछ सुधार कर सकते हैं। ठीक है। जेफ और आपके विचारों में जेफ को यहां लाया हुआ है। मैं एक कुर्सी लाता हूँ। ठीक है। जेफ का स्वागत है। और, और हाँ, यहां है जेफ। उसका चेहरा ऐसा दिखता है जैसा तुम उसे याद रखते हो और अपने ख्वाब में उसे तैयार करो। और फिर जब तुम तैयार हो, तो उस लम्हे में जो भी तुम्हार"
21,"Jeff, I feel very frustrated about the situation that you have left me and the children in. I think you understand how hard it is at times and the things that I have to explain to them about about this situation. It bothers me that you don't go out of your way to spend extra time with the children and I really believe that in the future, they, they will come to, to really resent that and, and not look at you as as their father, I, I honestly can't understand why you don't want to spend more time with them. And irrespective of what's happened between between us and and you moving on and, and so forth. I just don't think that that your children and my children should really suffer in that way. we'd like them to have as as normal a life as possible and, and be able to, to be with both of their parents and why you know what is so important rather than them wanting to be with them. It's it's just very hard. ",symp/reasoning,197_21,P,id,,"Jeff, mujhe bahut bechaini hai is situation ke baare mein jismein tumne humare bachon ke saath mujhe chhod diya hai. Main sochti hoon ki tumhe kabhi kabhi kitni mushkil hoti hai aur unhe is situation ke baare mein samjhana padta hai. Mujhe pareshani ho rahi hai ki tum apne bachon ke saath adhik samay nahi bitaate aur main sach mein yakin karti hoon ki aane waale samay mein woh tumhe sachmuch nafrat karenge aur tumhe apne pitaji ke roop mein na dekhenge, main apshabd nahi kar sakti ki tum unse jyada samay kyu nahi bitaana chahte. Aur humare beech jo bhi hua aur tum aage badhne ke baad, mujhe is baat se bohot dukh hota hai. Main sirf yahi nahi sochti hoon ki humare bachon aur tumhare bachon ko is tarah se sehna nahi chahiye. Hum chahte hain ki unhe jaisa normal zindagi ho sake aur dono parents ke saath rehne ki yeh unki haq bhi hai. Isse zyada tum kya chahte ho ki woh unke saath rehna pasand karein. Yeh bohot mushkil hai."
22,"Okay. Okay, so there's a kind of question you understand why this happened, etc. Right? So what next thing we'll do, you'll sit over there, and you will be Jeff and see what Jeff can answer to you as to where he is at. That maybe a little bit difficult But let's do a dialogue as if he were he's not here anyway. ",routine,197_22,T,id,,"Tho theek hai. Theek hai, toh wahaan ek tarah ke sawal hai jisse tumhe samajh mein aayega ki ye kyun hua, aur aise hi sab chalta rahega, right? Ab agli baat jo hum karenge, wahaan tum baithenge, aur tum Jeff banoge aur dekhenge ki Jeff tumhe kya jawaab deta hai ki wo kahaan hai. shayad thoda mushkil hoga, par chalo hum ek baatein karenge jaise ki wo ho hi nahi raha hai."
23,Yeah.,routine,197_23,P,ack,,Haan.
24,"So we'll, we'll be having a dialogue between Jeff, imaginary Jeff, and you in the present here and now. Okay. And what is what is he saying? I know they're the hurts and frustration a but any appreciation that he still cares for these children as a father.",routine,197_24,T,id,,"""So he'll, he'll be having a dialogue between Jeff, imaginary Jeff, and you in the present here and now. Alright. And what is what is he saying? I know they're the hurts and frustration but also any appreciation that he still cares for these children as a father."""
25,"I really don't have any appreciation for that because the reason the reason that you've given that you're busy, like I'm busy in my life and I still give our children priority, they still take precedence in my life. And I just don't think that that, that that's right ",routine,197_25,P,id,,"मुझे कोई प्रशंसा नहीं है। क्योंकि तुम हो व्यस्त हो, जैसे मैं भी अपने जीवन में व्यस्त हूँ लेकिन मैं अपने बच्चों को आगे रखता हूँ। उन्हें मेरे जीवन में प्राथमिकता है। और मुझे यह लगता है कि यह सही नहीं है।"
26,Actually what kind of father you should be for the children?,routine,197_26,T,irq,,Actually tum bachcho ke liye kaisa baap hona chahiye?
27,"You should be proactive in wanting to save them. And I wouldn't mind if you wanted to see them more than then what we have agreed is there are times when when you Want to do something spontaneous and and see then then then feel free to contact us and, and see if it's okay.",routine,197_27,T,id,,"Tumhe chahana chahiye ki tum unhe bachane ke liye proactive ho. Aur main koi farak nahi padta agar tum unhe dekhna chahte ho zyada se zyada woh jo humne tay kiya hai, kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota hai jab tum kuch tattva seva karna chahte ho aur unhe dekhna chahte ho, toh hamein zaroor sampark karein aur dekhein ki kya yeh theek hai."
28,"Sounds like a very good idea. Good offer you Jeff, are you prepared to take that off for the kids sake? Its great go your way what's what's going on here? The contracts happening okay. Seems Parties seem to be agreeing began to agree to something important. That's the children. So children will not suffer, they will actually benefit from that agreement, if you two can really, really come to a mutual agreement to what, how we're going to take care of the children. Because the thing no matter how, in my view, no matter how people live together as a couple separate together, the contract life countries, I'm still my father to my children as a mother as much as we could only get that anger out frustration out, we can come to an agreement as to how we're going to work together and even if you don't, they don't live together. We would live for the with the kids they'd be happy. Does that make sense to you?",routine,197_28,T,id,,"Lagta hai bohot acha idea hai. Acha offer hai Jeff, kya tum tayyar ho usse children ke liye chhodne ke liye? Its great go your way kuch kya chal raha hai yaha par? Contracts ho rahe hain, teek hai. Lagta hai parties ko kuch important par hamesha haal mil chuka hai. Wahi toh children ke liye tum log ek dusre se milkar kuch mutual agreement par pahunchna bohot zaruri hai. Kyunki vaise toh chahay tum dono alag alag duniya mein raho, par bacho ke liye, yeh contract life countries ke liye, main bhi apne baccho ka baap aur tum bhi unki maa hi rahoongi, humein bas apni gusse aur frustration ko bahaar nikal ke, hum ek dusre se kaisa kaam karenge uspe ek agreement par pahunchna hai. Aur agar tum log sath nahi rehte ho, to bhi hum bacho ko khush rakhenge. Kya tumhe samajh aa raha hai?"
29,Yes.  This is in a counseling session. And He hasn't really participated in informing his contract.,routine,197_29,P,id,,Haan. Yeh ek counseling session mein hai. Aur woh apne contract ko batane mein bilkul bhi hissa nahi le rahe hain.
30,"But you hear that this happened for you. And you've done it. So is there something that the now you have that you can begin to negotiate with him, no matter how he is? Because there's now a new realization that the children need that. Father and Mother. How's that for you? ",routine,197_30,T,irq,,"Lekin tumhe suna hai ki tumhare saath yeh hua hai. Aur tumne yeh kiya hai. Toh kya tumhare paas ab koi ayesa hai jisse tum use uske saath baat kar sakte ho, chahe woh kaisa bhi ho? Kyunki ab ek naya gyaan hai ki bachon ko woh zaroorat hai. Baap aur Maa. Tumhare liye kaisa hai?"
31,"Yeah, maybe I just need to let him know that And just extend the invitation of having more time out there. Yeah. Yeah,",routine,197_31,P,id,,"ha, ho sakta hai ki mujhe bas use batana chahta hoon ki aur yahan zyada waqt ke liye moka ho ha,"
32,you're good at that. You're very good. Who's watching you working here? You're very good at creating contracts and very clear about what you want. And it's a question of how you can the two parties can get to that agreement together. What do you think?,routine,197_32,T,irq,,"Tum usme ache ho. Tum bahut ache ho. Kaun aapko yahaan kaam karte huye dekh raha hai? Tum contract banane mein bahut ache ho aur jo chahte ho, use bohot saaf taur par samajhoge. Yeh do taraf ke saath milkar ek agreement par pahunchne ki baat hai. Tum kya sochate ho?"
33,Yeah,inactive,197_33,P,ack,,हां
34,"Great, because that's, this is a rehearsal for what's going to happen.",inactive,197_34,T,ack,,"Bahut achha, kyunki yeh ek abhyaas hai jo hone waala hai."
