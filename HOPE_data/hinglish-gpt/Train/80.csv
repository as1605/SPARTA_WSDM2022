0,"Do you have on your presentation? Do you have so many? Like bullet points you want to cover? Like,",routine,80_0,T,irq,,"Kya tumhare paas presentation hai? Kya tumhare paas bahut zyada hain? Jaise tum chahte ho cover karne ke liye bullet points? Jaise,"
1,"yeah, okay, like an outline sort of thing.",routine,80_1,P,id,,"haan, thik hai, jaise hi ek outline ki tarah ek chiz."
2,Okay. Would it help to time the deep breathing with reviewing each one of those bullet points?,routine,80_2,T,orq,,Thik hai. Kya isse deep breathing ko har ek bulleted point ko samay ke saath dekhne mein madad milegi?
3,We never thought about that.,routine,80_3,P,od,,Hum kbhi uske baare mein nhi socha.
4,"I don't know how many bullet points you'd have in a presentation. Maybe you'd have 10 or 20. Yeah, depending on how long right so maybe you as you start to review a certain bullet point As you're trying to get it into your memory and think about it, you breathe in really deeply. And then as you continue on, you just let out that breath really slowly,",routine,80_4,T,id,,"मुझे नहीं पता कि आप प्रस्तुति में कितने बुलेट पॉइंट्स होंगे। शायद आपके पास 10 या 20 होंगे। हां, यह उसकी लंबाई पर निर्भर करता है, इसलिए जब आप किसी निश्चित बुलेट पॉइंट की समीक्षा शुरू करते हो तो उसे अपनी याददाश्त में रखने की कोशिश करते हैं और सोचते हैं, तो आप गहराई से सांस खींचते हैं। साथ ही, जैसे कि आप आगे बढ़त"
5,"like a rhythm sort of, huh? Yeah. Can you go and do the same thing?",routine,80_5,P,irq,,"Kya tum bhi kuch aisa hi kar sakte ho, jaise ek taal ki tarah? Huh? Haan. Kya tum jaa kar wahi cheez kar sakte ho?"
6," I thought about it that way. I'm just thinking it'd be some way to structure. So you would, you would get in so many breaths,",routine,80_6,T,id,,"Maine is soch liya ki kisi tarah se hum structurized kar sakte hain. Toh tumhe, tumhe us tarah, tum bahut saare saanson mein aa sakte ho."
7,something I wouldn't forget. Yeah.,routine,80_7,P,id,,Kuch toh main bhool nahi sakunga. Haan.
8,"Yeah, something that kind of becomes a habit. Okay. Just make sure you keep your bullet points of length. About a few paragraphs. Yeah. But just just a few seconds each. So you can get a good deep breath and, or you could, you know, if you did have a longer bullet point, you could have obviously, several breaths, but just some rhythm that you could kind of grab on to something concrete. Yeah. Because I know that. In that moment, things are probably like you mentioned zoning out and right It becomes very easy to lose your anchors.",story,80_8,T,id,,"Haan, yeh cheez jo thoda se aadat ban jati hai. Thik hai. Bas dhyan rakho ki tum apni length ke bullet points maintain rakho. Kuchh do-do paragraph ke baare mein. Haan. Lekin har ek bullet point ke liye kuchh seconds hi rakho. Taki tum achhe se saans le sako aur, ya fir, agar teri bullet point thodi lambi hai, toh aap obviously, kai saans le sakte ho, lekin bas koi aisi riyaaz ho jo tum pakad sako kuchh tangible. Haan. Kyunki mujhe pata hai ki. Us pal mein, cheezein shayad tumhara dhyan kahin aur jaa raha hoga aur sahi hai, yeh bahut aasan ho jaata hai ki tum apne anchore kho do."
9,"Yeah, exactly. And just get really foggy, almost dizzy.",symp/reasoning,80_9,P,ack,,"Haan, bilkul. Aur bas bahut dhundhla ho jao, lagbhag chakkar aane lag jao."
10,"Yeah, so if you can remember, you know, for a particular bullet point that you want to take three deep breaths. And that might be something you can really have one too. Yeah. And would we kind of cut through that fogginess something could still do. Okay. When's the next presentation in that class that's coming up?",routine,80_10,T,irq,,"Haan, toh agar tum yaad rakh sakte ho, toh ek khaas bullet point ke liye tum teen gehri saansein le sakte ho. Aur yeh kuch aisa ho sakta hai jo tum ek se thoda bahot kr sakte ho. Haan. Aur jab hum us dangal se nikal paaye toh kuch aisa kar lene ke liye bhi hai. Thik hai. Woh next presentation kaunsi class mein hai jo nikal raha hai?"
11,"The next one, I believe is next Friday.",routine,80_11,P,id,,"अगला एक, मैं मानता हूँ अगला शुक्र"
12,Is that the next presentation you have? Like in all the classes is the one,routine,80_12,T,yq,,Kya woh agla presentation hai jo tumhare paas hai? Jaise har class mein hai woh ek.
13,Yeah. .,inactive,80_13,P,op,,Haan.
14,Okay. And that's next Friday. Mm hmm. Do you know where you are in the order? Like for presenting?,routine,80_14,T,irq,,Okay. Aur woh agle Friday hoga. Mm hmm. Kya tumhe pata hai tum kis kram mein ho? Present karne ke liye?
15,"Um, I think I'm actually third in this one.",routine,80_15,P,id,,"अरे, मैं लगता हूँ इस बार मैं तीसरा ह"
16,not first. And this one's how many minutes,routine,80_16,T,irq,,Kis tarah ka waqt hai ye aur kitne minute
17,I'm like 15 or so.,routine,80_17,P,id,,मैं 15 साल के बराबर ही ह
18,"Okay, it's a little shorter than 20 minutes. So you have about a half hour, maybe a little more, if there's time to switch out of kind of sitting there, right. And potential time where you could be anxious. Yes, but also potential time and you could be reviewing the notes your bullet points and breathing.",story,80_18,T,id,,"Theek hai, yeh 20 minutes se thoda chota hai. Toh tumhe ek aadha ghanta hai, sayad thoda zyada, agar waqt ho toh baithne se alag hone ka. Aur wahan tum chintit ho sakte ho. Haan, lekin saath hi waqt hai tumhare notes chunautiyon aur saans lene ko dohrane ka."
19,Yeah.,inactive,80_19,P,ack,,Haan.
20,"And saying to yourself, that's so like, kind of self talk, that they're not really paying attention to me anyway. Right. Right. Because that might help reduce that. That anxiety. Yeah. What's one thing you could say to yourself when you're up there?",routine,80_20,T,irq,,"Aur apne aap se kehte huye, yeh toh bilkul, apni baat karne ki tarah hai, ki unhe mujhe dhyaan nahi de rahe hai. Sahi. Sahi. Kyunki yeh madad kar sakta hai us ghutan ko kam karne mein. Woh chinta. Haan. Tumhare dimaag mein kya ek cheez hai jo tum khud se keh sakte ho jab tum upar ho?"
21,"I guess I could say that, you know, in general, I do pretty well. You know, one bad grade as in going to war. Make me doesn't mean that I don't deserve to be here.",symp/reasoning,80_21,P,id,-2.0,"I guess main yeh keh skta hoon ki, tu janta hai, overall toh main kaafi ache se kaam krta hoon. Tu janta hai na, ek buri grade toh jaise war jaane se hai. Ye mere liye iska matlab nahi hai ki main yaha hona nahi deserve krta."
22,"Okay, so the sort of self talk up there could be I deserve to be here.",symp/reasoning,80_22,T,cd,,"Achha, toh usi tarah ki apni baat-kamre mein ho sakti hai ki main yahaan rahna hakdar hun."
23,"Maybe I've prepared enough, you know that I know that I've prepared. And I'm a good student. Okay.",routine,80_23,P,cd,,"Shayad maine bohot tayyari kar li hai, tu jaan bhi in baton ko ki maine tayyari ki hai. Aur main ek acha student hu. Theek hai."
24,I've prepared enough. I'm a good student. I deserve to be here.,routine,80_24,T,cd,,Mera kaam tayyar hai. Main ek achha vidyarthi hoon.Mera yahan rehne ka poora adhikar hai.
25,Yeah.,inactive,80_25,P,ack,,Haan.
26,Is that something that would be helpful to write down and have as part of your notes that you can?,routine,80_26,T,irq,,"Kya yeh aapke liye kuchh madadgaar hoga, jo aap likhkar apne notes mein shamil kar sakte hain?"
27,"Yeah, I think it would actually, I can recite that.",routine,80_27,P,op,,"""Haa, mujhe lagta hai ki vo sach mein kar sakta hu, main usse padh sakta hu."""
28,"Yeah, internally as you because it's not long.",routine,80_28,T,id,,"हां, आंतरिक रूप से आप क्योंकि यह लं"
29," I think I could, it will be easy to remember. And I could just like maybe put it down on one of my note cards in front of me or something.",symp/reasoning,80_29,P,cd,,"Main sochta hun ki main kar sakta hun, yaad rakhne mein aasan hoga. Aur shayad main sirf apne ek se kisi note card par likh karke samne rakhsakta hun."
30,And how much do you believe that those statements are true?,routine,80_30,T,orq,,Aur tum kitni maanti ho ki woh statements sach hain?
31,"I think you know, sitting now, sitting here now I believe them in the moment sometimes it's a little hard to believe because I convinced myself otherwise. But I think I actually believe that that that that's true. They deserve to be in the program.",routine,80_31,P,od,,"Mujhe lagta hai ki tum jaante ho, abhi baithe hue, yahan baitha hue main unhe abhi bhi believe karti hu kai baar mujhe thoda mushkil hota hai yeh maan'na kyunki maine khudko kuch aur samjhaya hai. Lekin mujhe lagta hai ki main asal mein woh sach par yakeen rakhti hu. Woh iss program mein hona deserve karte hain."
32,"Okay, so there's those self talk items. You believe them to be true. Yeah, but you recognize in the moment, and I want you to be aware of this. You might not believe them as much, right? But remember that, you know, we worked on them. Right? You came up with them.",routine,80_32,T,id,,"Okay, toh woh khud se baatein hain. Tum unhe sach maante ho. Haan, lekin tum pal mein pehchaan aur main chahta hoon ki tum is baare mein jaan lo. Tum shayad unhe itna maan na paao, sahi? Lekin yaad rakhna, hum un par kaam kiye hain. Theek hai? Tumne hi unhe socha hai."
33,Yeah. ,routine,80_33,P,ack,,Haan.
34,And you believe them now. Right? So try to keep that in your mind as you start to doubt yourself. ,routine,80_34,T,id,,Aur tu ab unhe maante ho. Sahi hai na? Isliye apne mann mein ye baat yaad rakho jab tum apne aap par shak karne shuru karte ho.
35,Yeah. It's easy. I realize it's easy to form these plans. Right.,routine,80_35,P,ack,,Haan. Yeh aasaan hai. Mujhe yeh aasaan lag raha hai ki yeh planning karna aasaan hai. Correct?
36,"Then the chaos of anxiety in the words is harder. So the more tasks you can make concrete, and you can write down and you can rehearse, I think the better off you'll be. Okay. I would like to see you your presentations next Friday. Yeah, I would like to see you right before that. So be about a week. Okay for that. Do you have any questions? These are items you can rehearse still even without the presentation, the self talk and write the breathing, and of course preparing. But you have any questions between now and then you think?",story,80_36,T,id,,"Fir mai chaos se anxiety ke sabd me dikkat hoti hai. Isliye jitne bhi kaam aap concrete bana sakte hai, aur aap usse likh sakte hai, aur rehearsal bhi kar sakte hai, mai lagta hai aapko utna hi aacha milega. Theek hai. Mai aapke presentations ko agle Friday dekhna chahunga. Haan, mai chahta hu ki aap usse pehle right karde. Matlab koi week ke liye. Theek hai uske liye. Kya aapke paas koi sawal hai? Ye cheeze aap presentations ke bina bhi rehearsal kar sakte hai, self talk aur saans lena, aur tayyari karna. Lekin kya aapke paas ab aur agle se poochne ke liye koi sawaal hai?"
37,I don't think so I think it makes sense. Yeah.,inactive,80_37,P,on,,"Mujhe lagta nahi ki yeh sahi hai, mujhe lagta hai yeh sahi hai. Haan."
38,Understand kind of the plan to attack that anxiety symptom,symp/reasoning,80_38,T,id,,Anxiety symptom ko attack karne ka plan ko samajhna padega kind of ke hisab se
39,"And I think you know, what you kind of suggested before, like, maybe practicing my deep breathing. Like maybe now, like when I'm calm and getting into a habit of deep breathing, like, I'm more apt to also remember it, then.",symp/reasoning,80_39,P,id,1.0,"Aur mujhe lagta hai tum jante ho, ki tumne pehle kya sujhaav diya tha, jaise ki, shayad apni gehri saanso ki practice karne ki. Jaise ab, jab main shaant hokar gehri saans lena shuru kar doon, tab main usse yaad rakhne ke liye zyada taiyaar hongi, phir."
40,"Right. So, so good. So you have some kind of behavioral pieces. Focus on studying the breathing. And so cognitive pieces that the self talk we talked about, yeah. That you use when you're seated and use when you're at the podium,",routine,80_40,T,id,,"Haan. Toh, bahut achha. So tumhare paas kuch tarah ke vyavaharik tukde hain. Dhyan ""breathing"" par lagao. Aur soch se sambandhit tukde hain jaise, humne baat ki hai, haan. Jo tum baithkar aur manch par use karte ho."
41,right,inactive,80_41,P,ack,,sahi
42,"And actually presenting. Alright, good. So I'm glad we have a plan going forward. I think that you did a really good job today, helping kind of untangle this and figure out what's going on. And I appreciate that. You were able to really connect with the symptoms and the thoughts and kind of realize how they're related. Yeah. And I feel like this is something that's going to serve you well as you move through this. ",inactive,80_42,T,id,,"Aur dekh rahe hain, accha. Toh main khush hoon ki humare paas aage ka ek plan hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki aapne aaj sach mei bahut accha kaam kiya hai, issme madad karke ke saath yeh alag karne mein aur samajhne mein kya ho raha hai. Aur iss baat ki shukriya ki aap ne asal mein symptoms se jodkar aur soch se jodkar realize kiya ki woh kaise judi huyi hai. Haan. Aur mujhe lagta hai ki yeh woh cheez hai jo aapke liye kaafi faaydemand rahegi jab aap iss par aage badhegi."
43,Thank you.,inactive,80_43,P,gt,,Dhanyavaad.
44,"All right. So I'll see you in, in a week. ",inactive,80_44,T,id,,Theek hai. Toh main tumhe ek haftay main hi milunga.
45,Okay. Thanks.,inactive,80_45,P,gt,,Thik hai. Dhanyavaad
46,"Thanks, Hazel.",inactive,80_46,T,gt,,"Thank you, Hazel."
47,summary,"The therapist is helping the patient with a presentation by using bullet points to cover. The therapist requests the patient to take deep breaths, in some structure while reviewing the bullet points. The patient is trying to avoid zoning out or dizziness. The therapist suggests three deep breaths per bullet point. The patient has a presentation next Friday and they have half an hour before their turn to present. The patient plans to practice breathing during that time, give themselves a self talk that they are a good student and one bad grade doesn't mean they don't deserve to be there. The patient is asked to make a card to recite these. The therapist also acknowledges that these may not be easy in the actual situation and asks the patient to practice this continously since this can be practiced without the presentation. The therapist asks to rehearse and meet them before the presentation, in a week. The therapist asserts to the patient that they are attacking the anxiety symptom. ",,,,,
