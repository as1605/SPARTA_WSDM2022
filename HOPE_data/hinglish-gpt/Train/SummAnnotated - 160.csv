And if you had a car you could like, go see friends more and get out of your lame Old Town and get to go do fun things. ",story,160_18,T,gc,0.0,"Aur ab tak, tum sab tum tanik tanik chilaate rehte ho ki tum bilkul kahin ke beech mein rehte ho. Agar tumhare paas gaadi hoti, toh tum doston ko zyada dekh sakte aur apne boring purane shahar se nikal kar, mazedaar cheezon ko karne ja sakte ho."

And I can't just, like, not go places, but ",symp/reasoning,160_21,P,gc,-2.0,"Aur mujhe samajh aa gaya hai ki main drive karna padta hai kyunki tum sahi ho. Yeh bilkul jaise ki kahin ka bich ka jagah hai. Aur main bas aise hi jagahon pe nahi ja sakta, par.."
22,"so I'm wondering if we can bring it back to some of those things you're talking about to help reduce your anxiety. Maybe that's one idea to help you be able to get in the driver's seat. What do you think? So, essentially, you're practicing getting the driver seat by like doing this treatment and get in the driver's seat of your anxiety, as opposed to being a passenger and you're letting anxiety outside really your life? Because that's what you're doing. What do you think?",symp/reasoning,160_22,T,gc,0.0,"Kya main soch raha hoon hum kuch aise cheezo mein wapas laa sakte hai jo tum baat kar rahe hai, jisse tumhari chinta kam ho. Shayad ye ek idea ho tumhari madat karne ke liye ke tum driver ki seat par baith sako. Tum kya sochte ho? Toh essence mein tum practice kar rahe ho driver ki seat par baith kar, iss treatment ke zariye aur tumhari chinta ko driver ki seat par bithane ki koshish kar rahe ho, bahar jaise ki anndhr chalaak kar tum apni zindagi ko nahi chalne de rahe ho? Kyunki vo hi toh tum kar rahe ho. Tum kya sochte ho?"
23,"There's a lot of puns, Jen.",symp/reasoning,160_23,P,id,-1.0,"Bahut saare puns hai, Jen."
24,"I'm punning ain't I? So, here's an idea. Let's get on board. We start treating this anxiety. We do it really, really good. job at it we work hard. And idea driving might not be quite as scary. And let's face it being anxious driver increases your risk accidents. ",symp/reasoning,160_24,T,gc,0.0,"Are I punning na? Toh, ek idea hai. Chalo join ho jayein. Hum yeh chinta ko deal karna shuru karte hain. Hum bohot acche se karenge. Kaam pe hum bohot mehnat karenge. Aur driving ki baat karte hain, thoda darr toh hoga hi. Aur sach maang lein, chinta se gaadi chalaana accidents ka risk badhaata hai."
25,"Well, that's helpful. Thanks. ",symp/reasoning,160_25,P,gc,0.0,"Acha, ye toh madadgaar hai. Dhanyavaad."
26,"So reducing your anxiety, It's gonna make you a safer driver.",symp/reasoning,160_26,T,gc,0.0,"इसलिए अपनी चिंता को कम करने से, आपको एक सुरक्षित चाल"
27,"Yeah, but all these things you keep telling me that I have to do to be less anxious. They involve like feeling really anxious. ",symp/reasoning,160_27,P,gc,-2.0,"Haan, par saari yeh cheezein jo tum mujhe kehte rehte ho, ki main kam anxious hone ke liye karna padega. Un mein se zyaada anxious feel hona shamil hai."
28,True.,symp/reasoning,160_28,T,gc,0.0,True.
29,there's no way to like can't you're supposed to like just make it go away.

Siiwaay iske, tumhe yeh achhaa karnaa chaaheye ki yeh gayab ho jaaye. Isse aur bura bannaa chaahiye nahii, achhaa bannaa chaahiye."""
30,"So here's what's interesting. You're really good at being really anxious. So you'll be really good at this. And it will go away. I promise you, I totally promise you. ",story,160_30,T,gc,0.0,Toh yaha hai sab kuch jo dilchasp hai. Tum bilkul ye bahut achhe ho tum bohat pareshan hone mein aur iss par tum bahut acche ho. Aur ye chala jaega.

36,"I know. It isn't. It's pretty insane, isn't it? I agree. Well, another option is you could just be anxious the rest of your life. Do they have a bus where you live? ",symp/reasoning,160_36,T,gc,0.0,"Mujhe pata hai. Yeh toh nahi hai. Yeh kaafi paagal hai, hai na? Main sehmat hoon. Chalo, ek aur vikalp hai, tum apni zindagi bhar pareshan reh sakte ho.

I mean, your parents are fairly nice. They probably drive around for the rest of your life, you know, until they pass away or something. In the meantime, what about that?
