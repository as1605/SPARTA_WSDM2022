0,"Alright, so let's see if we could let's rank those two things. Right so one is everyone's judging me how I was and the other is a poor grade. Which one is larger fear for you?",symp/reasoning,76_0,T,irq,,"Okay, dekhte hain hum kya kar sakte hain, hum unconsciously ke peeche aadhi raat jhagda karte hain. So, ek toh yeh hai ki sab mujhe judge kar rahe the ki main tha aur doosra ek ghatiya grade. Tumhare liye kaun sa bada fear hai?"
1,I would say maybe like judging.,symp/reasoning,76_1,P,id,,Main kehta hun shayad jaise hum judge karte hain.
2,"Okay, so the grades a concern.",symp/reasoning,76_2,T,crq,,"Thik haan, te grades chinta di bani han."
3,Yeah but I figured I could do better on the subsequent one but when people are have this opinion of you I feel like that doesn't go away as quickly,symp/reasoning,76_3,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan par mujhe lag raha tha ki agle waale pe main aur achha kar sakta hu lekin jab log aapke baare mein yeh khayal rakhte hai, mujhe aisa lagta hai ki woh jaldi se nahi chala jaata hai."
4,What would it mean? If they they thought you were anxious during that presentation?,symp/reasoning,76_4,T,crq,,Yeh kya matlab hoga? Agar woh samajhta hai ki tum us presentation ke dauraan pareshaan the?
5,I guess I worried that they would think I'm anxious because I don't know what I'm doing or I don't belong there. ,routine,76_5,P,cd,-1.0,Mujhe lagta hai ki main pareshan hoon kyun ki woh sochenge ki main ghabraaya hu kyunki mujhe pata nahi hai main kya kar raha hoon ya phir main wahan se nahi hoon.
6,"So if they notice your anxiety, then they think you don't belong in that level",routine,76_6,T,crq,,"Toh agar unko tumhara chinta dekhe, tab woh samajhte hai ki tum us level ke laayak nahi ho."
7,"Yeah. Like, I don't deserve to be in that program.",routine,76_7,P,cd,,"Yeah. Jaise, mujhe us program mein hona chahiye hi nahi hai."
8,"If they don't recognize those symptoms, they wouldn't think that, do they?",routine,76_8,T,crq,,"Agar unhe wo lakshan pehchan na sake, to wo sochenge nahi, kya?"
9,they might write that maybe they think that's why I'm anxious or that's why I'm not doing well.,routine,76_9,P,cd,-2.0,Uss raaste par wo shayad likh sakte hain ki shayad wo soch rahe hain ki yehi wajah hai ki main chinta mein hoon ya yehi wajah hai ki main achchi tarah se kaam nahi kar rahi hoon.
10,"Well, how do you feel about your abilities and status in the programming room?",routine,76_10,T,orq,,"Kya haal hai, aap apni programming room mein kshamata aur sthiti ke baare mein kaisa mehsoos karte hai?"
11,"I think you know, typically, I'm one of the top students in my program, and I've seen two Get the concepts pretty well. It's just when I have to demonstrate those concepts or demonstrate via, like a presentation or something, that I'm worried that, you know, maybe I'm an imposter or something, but so I start to question myself. But I think in general that, you know, I'm a pretty good student before this. And I'm doing pretty well in the program.",story,76_11,P,od,1.0,"मुझे लगता है तुम जानते हो, आमतौर पर, मैं अपने प्रोग्राम में शीर्ष छात्रों में से एक हूँ, और मैंने दोनों अच्छी तरह से कांसेप्ट ग्रस्प किए हैं। यह सब ठीक है, लेकिन जब मुझे उन कांसेप्ट्स को दिखाना होता है या प्रस्तुति के जरिए दिखाना होता है, तो मुझे चिंता होती है, क्योंकि शायद मैं कोई जालसाजी हूँ या कुछ और। इसलिए मैं खुद पर सवाल उठाने लगती हूँ। पर मुझे लगता है कि सामान्यतः, मै"
12,"So you're a good student, you recognize that you have this one area where you don't feel like you do a great job. That's presentations. In terms of grade, you really only had one bad presentation. But grades aside, you're anxious. And you're worried your classmates are gonna pick up on them.",story,76_12,T,crq,,"""So you are a good student, par tumhe pata hai ki ek area hai jahan par tumhe lagta hai ki tum accha kaam nahi kar paate ho. Voh hai presentations. Grades ki baat karein, tumhaare paas sirf ek bura presentation tha. Par grades aise aside rakh kar, tum pareshan ho. Aur tumhe dar hai ki tumhaare classmates in par nazar rakhenge."""
13,"Yeah, exactly.",inactive,76_13,P,cd,,"Haan, bilkul sahi."
14,Okay. So if they thought you were us were imposter. So if they thought you were imposter to say that that was something they actually believe because of what's been happening. What would that mean? What would it mean to your classmates that you were an imposter?,routine,76_14,T,irq,,Theek hai. Agar voh samjhte thay ki hum aap the aur aap imposter the. Agar voh samjhte thay ki aap imposter the toh iska matlab yeh hota ki voh asal mein yeh baat mantey thay kyunki jo ho raha tha usska. Yeh kya matlab hoga? Aapke classmates ke liye yeh kya matlab hoga ki aap ek imposter thay?
15,I don't know. Maybe I am. Maybe I don't deserve to be there.,routine,76_15,P,id,-2.0,Mujhe nahi pata. Shayad main hoon. Shayad main us jagah ke layak nahi hoon.
16,You don't deserve to be there.,inactive,76_16,T,crq,,Tumhe wahan hone ke layak nahi ho.
17,like maybe I shouldn't be in this program. I think they should just drop out.,routine,76_17,P,cd,,Mujhe lagta hai ki shayad main is program mein hona hi nahi chahiye. Main sochta hu ki ve bas dropout kar dena chahiye.
18,"So if they believe you're an imposter based on these physical symptoms, like anxiety and mood that means to you anyway, that that means you shouldn't be on there.",routine,76_18,T,crq,,"To agar woh tumhe is physical symptoms ke adhaar par naqli samajhte hai, jaise ki chinta aur mood, toh yeh tumhare liye matlab mein hai ki tum wahaan nahi hona chahiye."
19,Yeah.,inactive,76_19,P,op,,Haan.
20,What's it feel like to say that,routine,76_20,T,orq,,"""Ye keh kar kaisa mehsoos hota hai?"""
21,"Depressing I feel like I've worked really hard. You know, to get through atleast halfway through my program. And it really hurts to think that that will be true.",story,76_21,P,od,-1.0,"चिंताजनक मुझे ऐसा लगता है कि मैं बहुत मेहनत की हूं। आप जानते हैं, कम से कम मेरे कार्यक्रम के आधे भाग से गुज़रने के लिए। और मुझे यह सोच"
22,"Just think this whole time you really been given faking Do you really belong there?. So I'd like to move a little bit into evaluating evidence. So in this kind of therapy, we like to look at what, you know, what we're feeling and what we're thinking, and what's we can see what's observable around us. And, you know, that becomes evidence and then we analyze it, evaluate it, okay. You're worried at some level. You're worried that you don't deserve to be where you are right now. Yeah. That you're not good enough. To be a student in this program, yeah, programming. What evidence supports that belief that you're not good enough?",story,76_22,T,id,,"Sirf sochen fir se bhare samay mein aap faike prapt kar rahe hain? Kya aap sach mein wahan par haajaar hain? Toh main thoda sa praman ko moolyaankan karne mein aage badhna chahta hoon. Iss tarah ki chikitsa mein hume dekhna pasand hai ki hum kya mehsoos kar rahe hain aur hum kya soch rahe hain aur humare chaaron taraf hume kya dikhai de raha hai. Aur phir, hum uss praman ko pranalankaar karte hain, moolyaankan karte hain, thik hai? Aap kisi se chinta kar rahe hain. Aap chinta kar rahe hain ki aap iss samay jahaan hain, woh aapke layak nahin hai. Haan. Ki aap achhe nahi hai. Iss program mein ek vidyarthi hone ke layak nahi hai, haan, programming. Kya koi praman iss vishwas ka samarthan karta hai ki aap achhe nahi hai?"
23,"Now that I'm thinking about it here, I mean, there's not a ton to support. But in on that day, I can think of all sorts of, you know, things to tell myself",story,76_23,P,id,-2.0,"Ab soch rahe hoon main yahaan, matlab, koi khaas saath dene waala nahi hai. Lekin us din, main apne aap ko bahut se cheezein batane ke liye soch sakta hoon."
24,what's going on that day.,inactive,76_24,T,irq,,meh chal raha hai uss din.
25,"So maybe like I'm not prepared or because I'm messing up on the presentation that I'm going to get a bad grade and you know, if I can't speak in front of people, how am I going to speak in front of kids as a teacher, you know, one day that it will translate to something else. I can't get past this.",story,76_25,P,id,-1.0,"Toh shayad main taiyar nahi hu ya phir kyunki main presentation mein gadbad kar rahi hu toh mere ko ek bura grade milega aur tum jaante ho, agar main logon ke samne bolne mein safal nahi hui toh main ek teacher ke roop mein bachon ke samne bolungi kaise, tumhe pata hai na, ek din ye kuch aur badal jayega. Main isse paar nahi kar sakti."
26,"So even if you survived the program, somehow you might be bad at your job",routine,76_26,T,crq,,"Toh agar tum program se bach gaye ho, toh kuch na kuch tum apne kaam me bhi bura ho sakte ho"
27,yeah,inactive,76_27,P,op,,haan
28,any other evidence that points toward you being imposter?,symp/reasoning,76_28,T,irq,,kya koi aur saboot hai jo aapko imposter hone ki taraf ishara karta hai?
29,Besides My bad grade? Not a whole lot.,symp/reasoning,76_29,P,id,1.0,Mera grades kharab hone ke alaawa kuch khas nahi hai.
30,Right. So to be safe to say that a lot of that thought of I'm not good enough is kind of based on your feelings of anxiety.,symp/reasoning,76_30,T,cr,,"Sahi. To yeh kahna surakshit hai ki us zyada soch ka, jisme main khud ko kaafi takatwar nahi samajhta, kayi aham bhavnaon par aadharit hota hai jaise chinta ka mehsoos hona."
31,Yeah. Which are really intense like panic almost in the moment.,symp/reasoning,76_31,P,op,,Yeah. Jo sach me bahut tez hai jaise ki ek dam panic ki tarah.
32,Yeah so in a way you're believing With the anxiety will lead you to believe.,symp/reasoning,76_32,T,cr,,Haan toh kuch hadh tak tum yeh soch rahe ho ki chinta tumhe believe karne pe le aayegi.
33,"Yeah, definitely. ",inactive,76_33,P,op,,"Haan, zaroor."
34,"But in the bright light of scrutiny, there are a lot of facts to support the worst case, which is you don't deserve it. How about evidence that refutes that you're not good enough?",routine,76_34,T,id,,"Lekin dadkano ki roshni mein jab tikdasti ke jhaalak dikhayi diya, to bhi kai saare tathya hain, jo sabse bure haalaat ko samarthan dete hain, jisme hai ki tum is layak nahi ho. Kya tumhare khilaaf saboot hai ki tum paryapt nahi ho?"
35,"I would say that, you know, I was accepted into the program. Like there's kind of like, a pretty rigorous sort of testing and stuff, which I passed, to get interviews and such to get into the program. So I did that. Like I said, I'm a pretty good student, all considering, you know, before this kind of flick was happening.",story,76_35,P,id,1.0,"I would say that, you know, I was accepted into the program. Jaise ki waha ek pretty rigorous sort ke testing thi, jise maine clear kiya, toh mujhe interviews aur aise sab karne ko mila to get into the program. Isliye maine uska kar liya. Jaise ki maine kaha, main ek kaafi acha student hoon, considering all things, you know, before this kind of flick was happening."
36,"Okay, so you've got through a rigorous process to become a student You're doing well. You mentioned before, just the one bad grade right? Okay, so if you have friends in this program, right, if one of them came to you with this, this balance of, you know, one bad grade and some anxiety, yeah, versus passing, you know, rigorous standards and doing well, otherwise, what advice would you give them?",routine,76_36,T,id,,"Theek hai, toh tumne bohot mehnat karke student ban ne ke liye process cross kar liya hai. Tum acche se kar rahe ho. Tumne pehle bola tha na, sirf ek buri grade hai? Theek hai, agar tumhare is program mein dost hai, toh agar kisi ne tumse ye baat ki, ki ek buri grade hai aur thoda sa tension hai, haan, compared toh pass ho jana aur acchi tarah se kar lena, toh tum unko kya advice doge?"
37,"I mean, now that you're kind of like talking about it, like, you know, this or that sort of thing. It makes sense. I would probably say that, well, you seem to be doing pretty well so far. You know, that anyone evaluating would look at all of the cumulative how you're doing your performance, rather than that one grade",story,76_37,P,id,1.0,"Mein matabik ab jab ki tum uski baare mein kuch baat kar rahe ho, like, tumhare vichar hai ke, yeh ya woh tarah ka kuch. Yeh to samajh mein aata hai. Mera khayal hai, ki tum bohut ache se kar rahe ho abhi tak. Tumhare performance ko evaluate karne waale log, ek grade ke jagah, tumhare saare cumulative factors par nazar daalenge."
38,would you feel comfortable giving advice to yourself?,routine,76_38,T,orq,,क्या तुम्हें अपने आप को सलाह देने में
39,"I think I tried to sometimes, but my anxiety symptoms kind of like really, like you were saying, your anxiety tells you sort of I think I can think that but I think my anxiety symptoms are such in the moment that it's really hard. You know, and I'm replaying what happened before in my head anticipation predicting will happen again.",story,76_39,P,od,,"मैं सोचती हूँ कि मैं कभी-कभी कोशिश करती हूँ, लेकिन मेरे चिंता के लक्षण बहुत ही जटिल हो जाते हैं, जैसे आपने कहा था, आपकी चिंता कहती है कि मुझे वह करना चाहिए लेकिन मेरे चिंता के लक्षण उस समय इतने महत्त्वपूर्ण होते हैं कि यह बहुत ही मुश्किल हो जाता है। आप जानते हैं, और मैं अपने सिर म"
40,"So, so let's look at the the thought and the feeling. If you had to rate the percent that you believed this thought, this belief that you are not good enough to be in the program, like right now right now, yeah, but here with me. How much of your mind believes that that's true?",story,76_40,T,orq,,"So, so let's think about the feeling and the thought. If you had to give a percentage of how much you believe this thought, this belief that you are not good enough to be in the program, right now right now, yeah, but here with me, what would it be? How much of your mind believes that to be true?"
41,"I would say like, you know, a two or three like not very, I don't believe it very much right now because You know, I'm not presenting and it's just you and I not like a group full of people. So that pressure is not there here.",story,76_41,P,od,1.0,"मैं कहना चाहूँगा की, जैसे ही जानो, एक या दो आदमियों की तरह, बहुत नहीं, मैं उस पर काफी विश्वास नहीं रखता हूँ क्योंकि आप जानते हैं, मैं प्रदर्शन नहीं कर रहा हूं और सिर्फ आप और मैं हूँ, कोई समूह भरा हुआ लोग नहीं।"
42,So right now you're really not buying the idea that you're not good enough.,routine,76_42,T,crq,,"Abhi abhi tu sach mein yeh soch raha hai ki tu kafi accha nahi hai, toh mat kharido yeh vichaar."
43,"Yeah, that is correct ",inactive,76_43,P,op,,"Haan, vo sahi hai."
44,"So now let's move to let's say right in the near the end of presentation when that anxiety is there, and the classmates that could be looking at you, it could be negatively evaluating you because you're worried about how much do you believe that thought then?",routine,76_44,T,irq,,"अब हम लेट्स उस स्थान की ओर बढ़ जाएं जहां प्रस्तुति के आखिर में वह उत्तेजना होती है, और आपके सहपाठियों में जो आपको देख रहे हैं, वे आपका नकारात्मक मूल्यांकन कर सकते हैं क्योंकि आप उस विचार पर कितना विश्वास करते हैं?"
45,"I don't feel really confident. In that moment. It feels very real. Like, like any moment, they're gonna kick me out. Like, I'm just not doing well. I'm stuffing.",routine,76_45,P,id,,"Main pe bilkul bharosa nahi hai. Us waqt. Yeh bahut sach lagta hai. Jaise, jaise kuch hi derr mein, woh mujhe bahar nikal denge. Jaise, main bas accha nahi kar raha hun. Main chup kar diya hun."
46,"Yeah. really intense. So would you think that you were a more accurate evaluator of what's true or not. Now, or when you're in that state of anxiety,",routine,76_46,T,irq,,"Haan. bahut intense hai. Toh kya tumhe lagta hai ki tum ek zyada sahi moolyaankan karne waale ho ya nahi. Ab, ya jab tum us sthiti mein ho jo chinta ke hai."
47,"definitely now that anxiety that, you know, heart rate and sweating is not there.",routine,76_47,P,id,,"Hamesha toh pata chal gaya hai ki anxiety hai ki, pata hai na, heart rate aur sweating nahi hai."
48,"So this evaluation, the percent that you believe that true, this evaluation is more accurate?",routine,76_48,T,irq,,"Iska evaluation mein, tumhari believe percentage joh hai, kya yeh evaluation zyada sahi hai?"
49,"Yes, I think so.",routine,76_49,P,op,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai."
50,"And how much time in any given day would you spend kind of in a mood right now, or you can evaluate accurately?",routine,76_50,T,irq,,"और कितना समय किसी भी दिए गए दिन में आप अपने मूड में गुजारेंगे, या आप सही तरीके से मूल्यांकन कर सकते हो?"
51,"I would say, you know, when I'm not at risk of presenting, like, I feel like I spend the majority of my time, like, it's not something I worry about all the time, just leading up to and then mostly that day,",routine,76_51,P,id,,"Main keh na chahunga, tu janta hai, jab main kharaab nahi hua mein lamba samay bhi kar sakta hun, jaise main subah or adhikatar din mein, ye baat mujhe pareshaan nahi karti, bas pahle se tyari karte hue aur uss din jyaada dhyaan rakhta hun."
52,"okay. So the, so you're able to evaluate the way you are now, the vast majority of the time, right? There's a limited amount of time when you're not when there's A lot of motions going through, right? And at those times, you're maybe a little less reliable,",symp/reasoning,76_52,T,crq,,"Tikke. Toh, tui abhie jaisen khudko assess kar pa raha hai, vaisei bohot zyada samay mein, thik hai na? Vahin pe kuch samay ki seema hoti hai jab tui nahi kar sakta jab kafi saarey kaam ho rhien hote hain, sahi hai ki na? Aur unhi samayon mein, tui thoda kam reliable ho jaata hai."
53,right. Like my judgment is clouded.,symp/reasoning,76_53,P,op,,Sahi. Meri judgement ghum ho gayi hai.
54,"However, in that moment you still, those thoughts are strong, right? ",routine,76_54,T,yq,,"Kintu, uss waqt bhi tum, woh vichaar majboot hai na?"
55,"Yes, very troubling. ",routine,76_55,P,op,,"Haan, bahut pareshaan kar dene wa"
56,"Even though it's a small percentage, it's intense. And you kind of carry that around a little bit.",routine,76_56,T,crq,,"Chhote se percentage mein bhi, intensity hai. Aur use thoda sa saath lekar ghoomte ho."
57,Yeah. Exactly.,inactive,76_57,P,op,,Haan. Bilkul.
58,So I can see why this is frustrating for you.,inactive,76_58,T,id,,So main samajh sakta hoon ki aapke liye yeh khizaan karne wala hai.
59,summary,"The patient has a larger fear over everyone judging them. The patient believes other classmates recognise their symptoms of anxiety and may feel the patient does not deserve the program. The patient has had only one bad presentation in terms of grades. But on the day of presentation they think of reasons to mess up and are scared how they are going to speak in front of kids as a teacher in the future. The patient agrees a lot of their anxiety comes from their thought and not evidence. The patient agrees if they were to advice someone else in similar situation, they would assure the other person doing well and only the cumulative grades will be considered. The patient has an anxiety in anticipation that something will happen. The patient agrees their evaluation is clear at other days when they don't have presentation, however they point out that the emotions are intense during the presentation and their judgement is clouded.
