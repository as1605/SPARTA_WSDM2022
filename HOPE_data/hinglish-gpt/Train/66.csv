0,"Hi, Hazel Hey doing today.",inactive,66_0,T,gt,,"Namaste, Hazel Kaisi haal hai aaj?"
1,Okay.,inactive,66_1,P,gt,,Theek hai
2,Okay. Yeah. I know when we met last time for your intake. You were concerned about some presentations that you had to give at school. Yeah. And you want to talk about that today?,symp/reasoning,66_2,T,id,,Haan. Jee. Mujhe yaad hai jab hamaare paas aapki intake ka lekhapat Kiya tha. Aapko apne school mein jo Presentations dena tha uske baare mein pareshan tha kya? Aur aaj usi baare mein baat karni hai?
3,"Yes. So, in school. I am in school for teaching. And we have to give presentations a lot as you can imagine, on different things and So it's something that's recurring. And what happened was, I gave a really bad one one time. My way of presentation. Yeah, I wasn't feeling very well. And I gave, I think I was just really tired from studying all night and I gave a really bad presentation. And then like now ever since, like when I've tried to give subsequent presentations, I'm just so nervous, and I'm up there like sweating and like starting to forget what I'm gonna say. And I'm just like, a fear of, of getting up there and having to get a presentation because I feel like I'm gonna bomb it.",story,66_3,P,id,-2.0,"Haan Ji. Is school mein. Teaching ke liye main school mein hoon. Aur hamara bahut saare presentations dena padta hai jaise aap soch sakte hai, alag alag cheezon ke liye. Aur ye saare regularly hote hai. Toh hua ye ki, ek baar maine bahut hi bura presentation diya. Meri presentation ki tarah. Haan main bahut thak gayi thi, sab raat padhne ke baad. Main ek bahut hi bura presentation diya. Fir after that, jab bhi maine presentations dene ki koshish ki, mujhe poora nervous ho jaata hai. Main upar jaati hoon aur bohot paseena aata hai, aur main bhulne lagi hoon kya bolne wala tha. Aur main bas itna ke tarah, fear ho jaata hai, upar jaakar kuch present karne se phele, kyunki lagta hai ke main fir bhi fail kar dungi."
4,"Alright, so was there a time for like, recently when you had to give presentations?",symp/reasoning,66_4,T,irq,,"Theek hai, toh kyaa aapne kuchkhaas waqt pe recently haazir ho ke presentations dete hue dekha hai?"
5,"Yeah, I mean, like, before and earlier in my life, I'm towards the end of my degree. So you know, throughout program I have.",routine,66_5,P,id,,"Haan, mein keh raha hoon, waise, pahle aur meri zindagi ke pehle, mein meri degree ke aakhir tak jaa raha hoon. Isliye tu jaanta hai, is program ke dauraan mein ne."
6,How would you consider those?,routine,66_6,T,irq,,Kya aap wo dhyaan mein rakhte ho?
7,"pretty well, I mean, I consider myself a pretty good student. So normally I do pretty well, it seemed to, you know, come out of nowhere.",routine,66_7,P,id,1.0,"Mujhe khud achha student samajhne ke liye theek hoon. Jisse ki aam tor par mai bhut achhi tarah se kam kar leti hoon, woh out of nowhere se aa raha tha."
8,"So this presentation you gave with that received a poor score, maybe it was just an isolated incident.",routine,66_8,T,crq,,"Aise to yeh presentation jo tumne diya Jo ki kam score mila, shayad yeh ek akeli ghatna thi."
9,"Yeah, like I was saying I wasn't feeling very well.",routine,66_9,P,cd,-1.0,"Haan, jaise main bola tha ki mujhe bahut tez thaar-thaar nahi laga raha tha."
10,"But that experience has still led to a lot of things anxiety with subsequent presentations,",routine,66_10,T,yq,,Par uska anubhav phir bhi bahut se chijon ke sath tanav jese rup me bahut kuch lekar ane ke karan bahut kuch ho gaya hai jab subsequent presentations ke bare me socha jata hai.
11,"oh, yeah. Like, I'm worried about my grades suffering as a result. And you know how long well I'm going to do.",routine,66_11,P,op,-1.0,"Oh, yeah. Ji, main apne grades par pareshan hoon ki wo is ka nuksaan ho sakta hai. Aur tu jaanta hai ki main kitni der tak is mein safal rahunga."
12,"All right. So, would it be okay if we kind of step through the whole process of giving a presentation",routine,66_12,T,yq,,"Theek hai. Chalo, kya hame aise hi presentation dene ke process ko step by step dhang se kar sakte hai?"
13,Sure. All right.,routine,66_13,P,op,,Haan Ji. Theek hai.
14,"Just before I start with that, is this something that leads to anxiety? Like right now or other times are really just in that moment when you're presenting?",routine,66_14,T,irq,,"Kuch hi pehle main iske saath shuru karne ja raha tha, kya ye koi baat hai jise haal mein awaazish uthani padti hai? Jaise hi abhi ya phir kabhi kabhi jab aap darshan dene jaate hai?"
15,"Mostly. It's most intense in that moment. And like maybe like leading up to it, like in preparation that I know that this is going to happen. Like, I always know when I'm going to present like, it'll be like the teacher will say, Oh, well, you know, your this Thursday, someone else's next Thursday. So the closer it gets to that event, the more anxious I am, like in anticipation.",story,66_15,P,id,-2.0,"Mainly. Yeh uss moment mein sabse zaadatar jazbaat hotay hain. Jaise ki uss event ki tayari mein, jaise ki mein jaanta hoon ki yeh hoga, jaise ki mein present karne waala hoon, jaise ki teacher kehde, Aaiye, yeh Thursday hai, aur doosra Thursday koi aur hai. Isliye uss event se pehle jaane se usse aur jyaada udaasi hoti hai jutne ke liye."
16,"Okay, so you start feeling anxiety. A few days before presentation?",routine,66_16,T,crq,,"Thik hai, tu darr shuru kar diye hai. Presentation ke kuchh din pehle?"
17,"Yeah, I would say a few days mostly. ",routine,66_17,P,cd,,"Haan, Maine kaha hoga kuch din majboori mein."
18,When does it start to get really distressing for you?,routine,66_18,T,irq,,Kab se tumhein sach mein pareshan hone laga?
19,"like two days before or one day before that? I'm like, Oh, my gosh, like, Am I ready? Like what if I mess up? You know what if Get a bad grade all these like what ifs.",routine,66_19,P,id,-2.0,"Do do din phele ya ek din phele? Main ander hi soch raha hu, 'Kripiya, main tayar ho gaya? Agar main pareshaan kar baithu aur agar ek bura numbar aa jaye, saare ye sab 'What-ifs' kaise?"
20,"Okay, so would you be okay if we step into this process and kind of break down the steps of the presentation? Alright, so let's so what's one of the classes you're taking now?",routine,66_20,T,irq,,"Theek hai, to kya tum ho jaaoge theek agar hum is process mein daakhil ho ke presentation ke steps ko todkar analyze karen? Theek hai, to phir hum kya pehle vishay jo tum abhi seekh rahein ho dekhte hai?"
21,"early childhood,",routine,66_21,P,id,,Bal vikas ki pehli u
22,"So let's say you have a presentation in that class a few days from now. I just have just a normal presentation. Yeah. All right. So, Let's now move to two days out, where you would start to feel a little anxiety about it. Yeah. What's going through your mind at that two day out point?",story,66_22,T,irq,,"So, ji ab aapke paas vo class mein ek presentation ka mauka aane waala hai - Wahin bahut kuchh kehna hai_ thode bade sa presentation hai - Han Haan Ji. Accha theek hai. Ab do din baad teh hum start karte hain us presentation ke baare mein feel hona - Jee Cheez kya chal rahi hai tumhara dimaag mein do din baad?"
23,"Um, I would say like, Am I prepared enough? Like, did I do enough?",routine,66_23,P,id,,"Maine kaha ki, Kya main taiyyar enough ho gaya hun? Main kafi kiya hai?"
24,"All right. So your thought is, did I do enough preparation?",routine,66_24,T,yq,,"Sahi hai, to tumhara sochna hai ki maine kaafi taiyaari ki hai kya?"
25,"Yeah. Which leads to maybe I did is what I'm really thinking like, I'm not prepared enough as I should be.",routine,66_25,P,op,-2.0,"Achha. Jisse ye lag raha ki mujhe soch raha hun, jaise ki main jitne taiyaar nahi hun jaise ki main hona chahiye."
26,"So that's that's the thought you're having 40 hours before the presentation. I'm not prepared enough. And kind of thinking about that thought. And what happens afterward? Do you have a reaction like any type of emotional, affective, affective reaction to that?",story,66_26,T,irq,,"Aise hi waisa hi soch rahi ho 40 ghanton pehle presentation ke pehle. Main taiyyar nahi hoon. Aur us soch ko lekar soch rahi hoon. Aur baad mein kya hota hai? Kya tumhe kisi bhi tarah ki emotional, affective reaction hai uske liye?"
27,"So at that point, I'm usually like, more like anxious, maybe like irritable a little bit. Mostly.",symp/reasoning,66_27,P,id,-2.0,"So tab us waqt, main waise hi ho jaata hu, jyaada tar tanaav wali, thodi si ghabraahat bhi ho jaati hai. Aksar hi."
28,And that goes substantially unchanged that feeling for how long?,symp/reasoning,66_28,T,irq,,Aur woh logon ki feelings ko kitne samay tak aise he bana hua hai?
29,"I'm like The day before it like kind of gets more intense when I'm like nitpicking like, well, I forgot this or I didn't forget this and, you know, remembering what happened last time when I didn't do so well and worrying about my grade, like more thoughts pop in my head of things that I forgot or what if sort of things.",story,66_29,P,id,,"Main jaisa din pehle uske jaisa ek nigraan ho jaata hai jab main jaisa nitpicking jaisa, haan main bhool hi gaya ki nahi bhool hi gaya aur jaanti hoon ki last time kya hua jab main accha naheen kiya toh aur mera grade par chinta hota hai ki main kya kya bhool hi gaya ya kya agar soorten ho jaata hai."
30,"Right, so the same type of thought just more intense, more intense and the feeling is also more intense.",routine,66_30,T,crq,,"Theek hai, isi tarah ke soch bohut jyada intense ho jati hai, aur feeling bhi bohut jyada intense ho jati hai."
31,Yes.,routine,66_31,P,cd,,Haan.
32,summary,"The patient is in school for teaching and they have to give presentations on different things. Once they gave a really bad presentation and ever since they have been nervous for subsequent presentations thinking they are going to bomb it. The patient has given presentations comfortably earlier in life and this is just an isolated incident as confirmed by the therapist. They fear if their grades are going to suffer. The patient says it is most intense in the moment that leads up to presentation, in anticipation. The patient starts to feel anxious a few days before and the most distressing moment is two or one day before. The patient feels their fear just before the days leading up to the presentation day, say 40 hours before is if they had prepared enough or they forgot something. Then they feel a little bit anxious and irritable. Towards the end, they nitpick, worry about grade and ask what if sort of things. ",,,,,
