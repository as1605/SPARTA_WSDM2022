1,"Okay, how are you? ",inactive,17_1,P,gt,,"ठीक है, तुम कैसे हो"
2,I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.,inactive,17_2,T,gt,,Main theek kar raha hoon. Poochne ke liye dhanyawaad.
3,"Yes, um, I would like to be able to kind of I've been feeling a little depressed and I would really like to be able to reduce those depressed you know, the depression.",symp/reasoning,17_3,P,gc,,"""Haan, umm, mujhe aisa karna hai ki main thoda sa low feel kar raha hoon aur main sach much yeh chahunga ki woh, tumhe pata hain, yeh depression ko kam kar sakoon."""
4,"So reduce feelings of depression. Yes, that'd be a cool okay. Yes. So Sounds like a good goal. So what objectives what tasks Do you think that you could do? That would help you to feel less depressed?",routine,17_4,T,irq,,"क्या उदासी के भावों को कम करना है। हां, यह ठीक होगा। हाँ। अच्छा लक्ष्य लगता है। तो आपको कौनसे उद्देश्यों व कार्यों की आवश्यकता है जो आपको कम उदासी महसूस करने में मदद करेंगे?"
5,"I guess maybe some sort of physical activity, maybe like walking. I like to be outside. So maybe walking could be one. Okay.",routine,17_5,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta hai shayad koi sharirik gatividhi, jaise chalna ho sakta hai. Mujhe bahar rehna pasand hai. To shayad chalna ek option ho sakta hai. Thik hai."
6,Have you had a plan before we have walked regularly?,routine,17_6,T,irq,,आपके पास कोई योजना थी हम नियमित रूप से चलते हुए से
7,"You know, I used to. I did. And it was, it was, it was a it would give me some relief, because I was I was able to clear my mind whenever I was walking. And so I Yes, yes, I've had success with walking before.",routine,17_7,P,id,,"Tu janta hai na, main pehle karta tha. Main kartaa tha aur ye, ye, ye mujhe kuch aaram deta tha, kyunki main apne dimag ko saaf kar pata tha jab bhi main chal raha hota tha. Aur isliye maine, haan, haan, maine pehle chalne se success paayi hai."
8,So Walking has worked before.,symp/reasoning,17_8,T,yq,,तो चालना पहले काम कर गया ह
9,Yes.,inactive,17_9,P,ack,,"Haan, bil"
10,And you notice that you're walking less since you've had a first impression. I,routine,17_10,T,crq,,Aur tere notice hain ki tu wehle hua hota hai kyunki tere paas pehli mulakaat ki yaad hoti hai.
11,"really haven't been doing too much of anything I've just been kind of at home doing homework, stressing out over doing getting homework done. Because I'm, you know, back in school, and it's been so stressful and overwhelming. You know, like I said, it's just kind of gotten me in this little funk, this depressed mood. So",story,17_11,P,cd,,"Actually mujhe abhi kuch zyada hi kaam nahi ho raha. Main sirf ghar pe homework kar raha hoon, homework karne se pareshaan hoon. Kyunki main, aap jaante hain, wapas school mein hoon, aur yeh bahut stressful aur overwhelm ho gaya hai. Jaise maine kaha, yeh mujhe ek chota sa depression ka maahaul de diya hai."
12,"since you're on the topic of homework, which is something you think you can do there, you mentioned that it's stressful and overwhelming. And that sounds like the type of feelings that are related to depression sometimes. Mm hmm. Do you find that kind of being stressed about homework is?",routine,17_12,T,orq,,"Kyunki tum homework ke topic pe ho, jo ek cheez hai jise tum vahaan kar sakte ho, tumne kaha ki wo stressful aur overwhelming hai. Aur wo feelings depression se related hote hain kabhi kabhi. Mm hmm. Kya tumko lagta hai ke homework se stressed hona aisa hi hai?"
13,"Yeah, because you know, is there's so much work to be done and sometimes a good you know, several assignments. Do And at the same time, and I find myself rushing to get assignments and and, you know, it can just be a little daunting. It's just overwhelming sometimes. So yeah. And I don't know, maybe if I spaced that out and, you know, took, you know, did some time management or something like that I don't know, to kind of help me",inactive,17_13,P,od,,"Haan, kyunki pata hai na, itna kaam hai jisko karna hai aur kabhi kabhi ek acha, kaafi assignments hoti hai. Lekin saath hi saath, main khud ko bhaagte hue paati hoon assignments pura karne ke liye aur, pata hai na, thoda daunting ho jaata hai. Kabhi kabhi toh overwhelming ho jaata hai. Toh haan. Aur pata nahi, shayad agar main assignments ko space out karti aur, pata hai na, thoda time management karti ya kuch aisa, mujhe help ho sakti hai."
14,feel like maybe you're starting the homework late compared to when it's due.,symp/reasoning,17_14,T,orq,,Lagta hai shayad tum homework ke liye der se shuru kar rahe ho jabki vo jama hone ki taareekh ke mukaable mein hai.
15,"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,17_15,P,od,,"Haan, haan."
16,That's the feeling maybe of overwhelmed.,inactive,17_16,T,orq,,Wohi eh hai shayad ke of overwhelmed.
17,"Yes, I would say that.",inactive,17_17,P,od,,"Haan, main yehi kahunge."
18,"So, yeah, you're right. It sounds like this is just an organizational thing, right. So if you if you can space it out where you kind of start your homework earlier, and do it in small bits, okay. Instead of me waiting more or less the last minute, right. That would reduce the mean likely, I would think reduce some of the stressed feelings of being overwhelmed.",routine,17_18,T,ci,,"Haan, haan, tum sahi bol rahe ho. Yeh lagta hai ki yeh sirf ek sangathanik baat hai, toh sahi. Toh agar tum chaaho, toh tum apna homework pehle se shuru karke, aur use chote chote hisso mein kar sakte ho, thik hai. Mere baad mein intezaar karne ki jagah, haan. Yeh kam kar sakta hai, dekhta hoon, stress ki feelings ko kam karne mein."
19,I'm sure it would you sure would.,inactive,17_19,P,ack,,मैं विश्वास करता हूँ कि आपको यकीन ह
20,"So one, make that your sec objective then so you have the walking, okay. And then you'll have trying to space out the homework. ",routine,17_20,T,ci,,"Toh ek, usse apna doosra uddeshya bana lo, taki tum chalna sikh jao, thik hai. Aur phir tum apne homework ko space out karne ki koshish karenge."
21,"Okay, that sounds doable",inactive,17_21,P,ack,,"Thik hai, yeh ho sakta hai."
22,sound good. All right.,inactive,17_22,T,ack,,Aacha lag raha hai. Thik hai.
23,Yes.,inactive,17_23,P,ack,,Haan.
24,What other objectives might work?,routine,17_24,T,orq,,Aur kya aur kis kaam ke liye maanle jane sakte hain?
25,Let's see.,inactive,17_25,P,od,,Chalo dekhein.
26,that worked in the past for you.,inactive,17_26,T,irq,,Woh aapke liye pehle achcha kaam kar gaya tha.
27,"You know, it was something that I enjoyed doing. And right now I feel like I'm not doing any of the things that I've enjoyed doing because I've been so busy doing work doing homework, so I think that would probably help.",routine,17_27,P,id,,"Tum jaante ho, yeh kuch aisa tha jise main karne se anand le raha tha. Aur ab mujhe lagta hai main woh sab nahi kar raha jo maine anand se kiya hai kyuki main kaam aur ghar ka kaam karte karte itna vyast ho gaya hoon, isliye mujhe lagta hai yeh mujhe madad kar sakta hai."
28,So it's a good break from thinking about stressing about this you put it to homework,routine,17_28,T,yq,,So yeh ek accha break hai jo iss baat pe stress karne se aap homework par daal dete ho.
29,Yes.,inactive,17_29,P,ack,,Haan.
30,It has kind of come in the singing parts fun for it sounds like but also there's a social component seems like,routine,17_30,T,irq,,"यह गाने के हिस्सों में ढेर सारा मज़ा है। थोड़ा सा लगता है कि वह खेलता है, लेकिन साथ ही कुछ सामाजिक अंग भी है।"
31,"Yes, it is. It is. Enjoy access to enjoy singing, and, you know, I enjoy the people that I was saying with and we will go and hang out together, go to different, you know, like jazz clubs or events, you know, different bands that were playing it you know, it'll just be nice. It's fun. I love music. So I love listening to it and I love you know, singing. So making music. So that was great. I think that would be a good goal.",routine,17_31,P,id,,"Yes, yeh enjoy karne waala hai. Ye hai. Enjoy karna ka mauka hai gaana ka, aur, pata hai, mere saath wale logon ko mai pasand karta hoon aur hum saath jaayenge aur time spend karenge saath mai, alag alag, jaise ke jazz clubs ya events mai, alag alag bands hai jo bajate hain, toh pata hai, woh bahut accha hoga. Mazaa aayega. Mujhe music pasand hai. Toh mai usko sunna pasand karta hoon aur mujhe pata hai, gaana pasand karta hoon. Toh music bananeka. Toh woh accha tha. Mai sochta hoon ke woh ek accha aim hoga."
32,You seem to kind of light up a little when you talk about singing.,routine,17_32,T,orq,,Tu ekdum se thoda joshila lag rahi hai jab tu singing ke baare mein baat karti hai.
33,"Yes, it's I I just love it. I enjoy doing it. And I just haven't had a chance to deal with lightning.",routine,17_33,P,od,,"Haan, yeh mein hi hoon. Mujhe woh sirf bohot pasand hai. Main usse karte rehna pasand karta hoon. Aur main ab tak bijli se deal karne ka mauka nahi mila hai."
34,so far. This is justmaking the time.,routine,17_34,T,gc,,so far. Ye sirf waqt banane ka hai.
35,"Yes, yeah. Yes.",inactive,17_35,P,gc,,"Haan, haan. Haan."
36,"Good. All right. So we'll make that the third objective. So we have walking and kind of organizing your homework differently. And then singing and that, that socializing, it's the companies that, that singing that's great. So three objectives is good. I try to get to four. If you have one. Is there a fourth objective that you can think of something else that you've associated with not feeling depressed when",symp/reasoning,17_36,T,orq,,"Theek hai. Thik hai. Toh hum usko teesra target banayenge. Isliye hum aapko thoda sa training aur apne homework ka alag tarike se vyaavastha karne ko bolte hain. Aur phir gana aur woh, woh socializing, yeh jo gaana hai na, woh bahut badhiya hai. Toh teen targets achhe hain. Main chahta hoon ki chaar karein. Agar aapke paas koi hai. Kya aap soch sakte hain ki koi chauthe target kaun sa hai jo aapne dil se jodke nahi khush mehsoos karne se sambandhit hai?"
37,"I used to absolutely love going to the beach and visiting with my aunt. And so that's two things. The beach. I love the beach because it's soothing. It's company. And I, my, she's just such an awesome person and she's always pouring into me and I just love spending time with her. So she lives down to pitch.",story,17_37,P,od,,"Mai toh bilkul beach jaane aur meri aunt se milne se pyaar karta tha. Waise dusri baat. Beach. Mujhe beach pasand hai kyuki woh dhoondhta hai. Woh saathi hai. Aur main, meri, woh toh bas itni amazing vyakti hai aur woh humesha mera support karte rehti hai aur main unke saath waqt bitane se bahut pyaar karta hoon. Toh woh pitch ke paas rehti hai."
38,"Yes, she does. Okay, so this seems like a good, good objective to Yes. So you're suggesting maybe visiting her more often?",routine,17_38,T,irq,,"Haan, woh karti hai. Thik hai, toh yeh ek achha lakshya lagta hai. Toh kya ab tum use zyada hamesha milne ke liye suggest kar rahe ho?"
39,"Yes. Again, just at home doing homework, and I haven't gone to visit her in a while. And the thing is, she only lives like an hour away. So it's not a it's not right. No, it's not. So that's like a, you know, a trip I couldn't do on a Saturday. Take a break and go down there and spend some time with that will be I think that will be helpful.",routine,17_39,P,id,,"Haan ji. Firse, ghar pe hi homework kar raha tha aur maine ek baar bhi usko milne nahi gaya. Aur baat yeh hai ki woh sirf ek ghante door rehti hai. Toh yeh thik nahi hai. Nahi hai. Toh aisa toh nahi hai. Is liye ek chutti leke waha jaana impossible hai. Thoda break leke jaana hoga aur waha jaake uske saath samay bitaana mujhe helpful lagega."
40,"So again, kind of kind of getting away from the school stressors. Just take taking a break from it for a day. Yes. And then also spend time with somebody that you enjoy spending time with. Good. Good. All right. So I want to go through each one of these. And just make sure that we're kind of meeting all the criteria for an objective, which I think we can do, but these are all specific, which is good. Do you feel these are all achievable? These are things you can do. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Well, someone that knew done in the past, right, ",routine,17_40,T,gc,,"Toh phir se, thoda school stressors se dur ho rahe hai. Sirf ek din ke liye break le lo. Haan. Aur uske sath waqt bitao jisse aapka waqt achha guzarta hai. Accha. Accha. Chalo, mei har ek chiz ko dekhunga. Aur dekho sabhi criteria objective ke liye pura ho rahe hai, jise mei kar sakta hun, magar yeh sab specificity hai, jisse achha hai. Kya aapko lagta hai ki yeh sab achievable hai? Yeh cheezein hai jo aap kar sakte ho. Mei aisa hi laga. Haan. Koi bhi cheez jo tumne pehle ki hai, hai na?"
41,right.,inactive,17_41,P,gc,,Theek hai.
42,"So now we have the specific and the achievable. I don't want to get too personal and more tricky, which is making it measurable. I like to do here. I don't want to be overly prescriptive in terms of objectives. I want you to decide. But I want to see We can quantify, in some manner, how often you'll be able to do these different things or how, you know, quite like a homer but to think about the spacing would be the quantity but, but first with the walking. So in a given week, say what's realistic for you in terms of getting out and walking? How many times?",routine,17_42,T,irq,,"Abhi hamare paas kuchh vishisht aur laabhya hai. Mujhe bahut vyaktigat aur jyada mushkil se bachna hai, jo yesko matra tairakshy bana deta hai. Main yahan karna pasand karta hoon. Main laambavti ke leads ke samuchchayi me adhik upadeshti nahin chahta. Main yah aap par chor na chaahta hoon. Lekin main dekhna chahta hoon ki ham kisee matra me, kitnee baar in alag-alag chijon ko kar paaoge ya, tum jaanata hai, thook ke raabitha bana sakate ho. Isaliye ek diya mujhe tha ki atesteeksr mai tum kya kar pao aur na chalane par bhabishy me thoda bhi ynna kadam pad sakate ho? Kitnee baar?"

So, the homework is a little trickier, right? This is about spacing it out. Okay? So the homework assignments, they're stressing you out. How much time did they take? Last few few questions. How much time do they take to complete? Generally? Like an hour? So",story,17_58,T,irq,,"6:30 ek tarah se achha hai, woh ek achha samay hai. Haan. 630 achha hai.

Haan. Toh woh tumhaari backup ho sakti hai. Haan, yeh sahi hai. Haan. Kyunki tumhe uske baad bhi aur chhe din hain poore karwane ke liye. Theek hai. Isiliye, woh sab seem realistic aur achievable."
95,It does.,inactive,17_95,P,ack,,Yeh karta hai.
96,Every so many Fridays.,inactive,17_96,T,crq,,Har kuch pe kuch Fridays ke beech.
97,every friday,inactive,17_97,P,cd,,Her friday ko
98,"So, so this is this isn't every Friday commitment. Right, this thing?",routine,17_98,T,irq,,"Toh, toh yeh yeh hai yeh nahi har Friday ki commitment. Sahi hai, yeh cheez?"
99,Yeah. But one Friday is generally it's maybe,routine,17_99,P,id,,"Haan. Lekin, usually ek Friday ussey ""maybe"" ho jaata hai."
100,"about two hours, two hours. So two hours every Friday. There's something really enjoyed though. So and it sounds like you look forward to it. Yeah. So Friday, two hours, I guess. Yes. afternoon or evening. Evening. Okay.",story,17_100,T,ci,,"Teen teen ghante, teen teen ghante. Toh har Friday teen teen ghante. Kuch toh bohut maza aata hai. Aur lagta hai ki tum iska besbri se intezaar karte ho. Haan. Toh Friday, teen teen ghante, main samajhti hoon. Haan. Dophar ya sham mein. Sham. Theek hai."
101,"Yeah, I mean, if I if it was something that came up that I really had to get done is not like I can't not go. So it won't be managed, right?",inactive,17_101,P,ack,,"Haan, main toh matlab, agar woh kuch aisa hua jisse mujhe karne ki zaroorat hai toh yeh bilkul nahi hai ki main na jao. Isliye woh handle ho jaega, na?"
102,"Yeah. Good. Okay. So that was the last objective this is. This is I guess about a whole day commitment, right? Because you go to the beach, it's an hour drive, so you probably wouldn't want to go down for just a few hours. More like the whole day, would they?",symp/reasoning,17_102,T,orq,,"Haan. Accha hai. Thik hai. To yeh tha aakhri lakshya yeh hai. Yeh mere hisaab se poora din ka waada hai, na? Kyunki beach par jaane ke liye, ek ghante ki sawaari hai, toh aap shayad bas kuchh ghanta ke liye nahi jaana chahenge. Jyada tar poora din hi jaayenge, kya?"
103,"That would be more like a Saturday. But of course, it wouldn't be every Saturday.",story,17_103,P,od,,"Vah Saturday jaise hi hoga. Par haan, har Saturday toh nahi hoga."
104,"So how many times and say a month, like once? Once a month? Okay. So you go down on Saturday morning and come back?",story,17_104,T,irq,,"तो कितनी बार और कहो महीने में, जैसे एक बार? महीने में एक बार? ठीक है। तो आप शनिवार की सुबह नीचे जाते हो और वापस आते हो?"
105,Yes.,inactive,17_105,P,id,,Haan.
106,"That's something to look forward to. Yes. Is that something that would be okay, in terms of like, because on Friday night, potentially, you'd be out. Right and then Saturday.",routine,17_106,T,orq,,"Ye toh ek umeed karne layak baat hai. Haan. Kya ye theek hoga, aapki nazariye se dekha jaye toh, kyunki Jumma raat ko aap bahar honge. Sahi hai phir Saturday ko."
107,"Yeah, if I, if all those Saturdays that I know that I'm going I could not be out too late on that.",routine,17_107,P,od,,"Haan, agar main, agar sab woh Shanivaar jinhe main jaanti hoon main gayab na rehta, zyada der tak."
108,"Okay, that's a good idea. So you kind of make sure you restrict how long you stay out? Yes. When you know that Saturday is coming",routine,17_108,T,irq,,"Theek hai, yeh ek achha idea hai. Toh tum thoda sa dhyan rakho ki tum kitna lambe samay tak bahar rehte ho? Haan. Jab tumhe pata hai ki Saturday aa raha hai."
109,"or not go at all, that's fine. Either way,",routine,17_109,P,id,,"Agar aap na jao, to bhi theek hai. Kuch bhi ho jaaye."
110,"just take a break that time. Yes. Restore. All right. So that's four separate objectives. And what I want to do since I've kind of made a lot of specific notations here, I want to take a moment just take a break, and print this up for you. Okay, we'll work on the rest of your goals next time but I want you to have this so you can get started on it right away. So before I print these up as a changes you want to make",story,17_110,T,ci,,"Bas thoda sa break le lo tab. Haan. Restore karo. Thik hai. Toh yeh chaar alag alag goals hain. Aur main yeh karna chahta hoon ki maine yahaan kaafi specific notes banaye hain, toh main ek pal ruk ke ise print karwa doon tumhare liye. Theek hai, agle baar hum tumhare baaki ke goals par kaam karenge lekin main chahta hoon ki tum haath mein lelo aur turant is par kaam shuru kar do. Toh jab tak main inhe print karwata hoon, tum koi bhi changes kar sakte ho."
111,"um, I would like to try that",inactive,17_111,P,ack,,"um, mai usko try karna chahta hu"
112,"And if it doesn't work, can we tweak? Oh yeah, we can always make changes. Maybe certain things will work really well. It Certain things, we'll have to take off the list altogether, maybe substitute something else. Yeah, we can, we can make edits to it the whole time you're here. Okay, we can just make a document that changes as as needed. But if you think it's a good starting place, I'll go and print this up as it is, and give you a copy and we can resume with today's session. And then next time I see in a week, or call the rest of the treatment plan. Beside the plan, yes. Thanks, Allison. ",routine,17_112,T,irq,,"Aur agar yeh kaam na kare toh hum ise tweak kar sakte hain na? Oh yeah, hum hamesha badlav kar sakte hain. Shayad kuch cheezein bahut acche kaam karein. Lekin kuch cheezein hum ekdum hata denge, shayad kuch aur cheezon se badal denge. Yeah, hum is par poora samay edits kar sakte hain jab tak aap yahan hain. Theek hai, hum ek document bana sakte hain jisse zarurat padne par badalte reh sakte hain. Lekin agar aapko lagta hai yeh ek accha shuruat ka sthan hai, mai ise print karke aapko de doonga aur aaj ke session ke saath resume kar sakte hain. Fir agle hafte, jab mai aapko dekhun ya treatment plan ki baaki strategies discuss karen, hum sath mein plan ko badalte hain. Plan ke alawa, haan. Shukriya, Allison."
113,Thank you.,inactive,17_113,P,gt,,Dhanyavaad.
114,summary,"The patient has felt a little depressed and wish to reduce those feelings. The patient has been stressing out doing homework and walking has helped them before to give some relief. The therapist clarifies organizing homework differently in small bits will help instead of last minute. The patient enjoys singing as it is a social activity. The patient also loves going to the beach and visiting their aunt. The therapist works out a plan with the patient. The plan is to walk every wednesday at 6:30 for the amount of time they are comfortable with. The patient would take three hours at max to complete their homework. The plan discussed is to do homework on wednesday right after the walk, then on Thursday and Sunday. The patient agrees all those feel realistic and achievable. The patient also adds a two hour plan on Friday evenings which is not every Friday. The therapist finally adds the whole day commitment to drive down to aunt's place once a month on any saturday. The therapist documents this plan and would review in the next session in a week.",,,,,
