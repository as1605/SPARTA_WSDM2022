31,"I'm selfish. You bought them selfish, okay? Yeah. Initially Yeah, that was that was it is right. That was selfish when you actually thought selfish, guilty, guilty and sad angry, angry, very angry that he made me feel about what I was doing that way I'm going forward he said that and then once he said that,you know he put that thought in my head and it made me angry.",story,192_31,P,op,-3.0,"Ham selfish hoon.

What did you do after you get angry?,story,192_32,T,gc,0.0,"Okay, jab wo tumse naraz hokar kehta tha ki tum khudgarz ho aur tumhe substrate mehsoos hua toh tumne khudko bhi selfish samjha aur phir gusse mein aagaye. Gussa hone ke baad tumne kya kiya?"

How do you think you could change from the smacking him to having a more calm and positive response?",story,192_38,T,gc,0.0,"Toh jab woh in sabko hone par gussa hota hai, tab tumse kuch cheezon ke liye naraz ho jata hai. Tum kya sochte ho, kya tum usko thappad maarna se shant rakhne ka ya firkhushnuma jawab dene ka ek tarika dhundh sakte ho?"
39,"I think if I was able to get the same thing,",story,192_39,P,od,-3.0,"Mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe wahi cheez mil jaati, agar main use haasil kar sakta."
40,how do you think you might be able to do that?,routine,192_40,T,orq,0.0,Tumko lagta hai ki tum woh kaise kar sakte ho?
41,Umm,routine,192_41,P,od,0.0,Arre ya

You start to feel selfish.",routine,192_42,T,gc,0.0,"Dekho, iss tarah hum CBT ke saath karenge ki hum tumhare vichaar badal denge. Toh jab voh tumse naraz hota hai aur tumhe swarthi kehta hai. Tum swarthi mehsoos hone lagte ho."
43,Yeah,routine,192_43,P,ack,0.0,Haan
44,So how could you not feel selfish? Even if you changed your thought?,routine,192_44,T,irq,0.0,To ye kaise ho sakta hai ki tum khudgarz na feel karo? Agar tum apne vichar badal diye to bhi?
45,"Yeah, I mean if I never even thought that I was selfish then I would have been angry.",routine,192_45,P,id,0.0,"Haan, I know if maine kabhi socha hi nahi hota ki main khudgarz hoon, toh main gussa ho jaata."
46,So do you think you're selfish?,symp/reasoning,192_46,T,orq,0.0,Kya tumhe lagta hai ki tum atyant swarthi ho?
47,Maybe the time I did die and I felt like awful but now like he says the wording for money but we're really not one might want to pay our bills or I want to do things i mean he's just kind of like a cheap person. We have plenty of money to we're not hurting at all and I do not feel confidence I don't think it was selfish to make myself feel prettier you know? But I think people do have their selfish tendencies.,symp/reasoning,192_47,P,od,-3.0,"Shayad woh waqt jab main mar gayi aur main bahut bura mehsoos kar rahi thi, lekin ab jaise usne paise ke liye shabdon ka istemaal kiya, lekin hum sach mein ek insaan ko apne bilkl bhugtan karne ki zaroorat nahi hai ya phir main un cheezon ko karna chahati hoon, yani, woh bas ek sastaa aadmi hain. Humaare paas bohat paisa hai aur hum kisi tarah se bhi dukh nahi mehsus kar rahay hain aur main khud ko khubsurat mehsoos karne ke liye khud ko khudgarz nahi maanti, aap samajhtay hain? Lekin main sochti hoon logon ke andar khudgarzi ki tendency hoti hai."
48,So I'm hearing you say is you don't think you're selfish at all.,routine,192_48,T,crq,0.0,To sun rahe ho ki tumhara matlab hai ki tumhe lagta nahi hai ki tum bilkul bhi swarthi ho.
49,"Oh, I mean, I'm Selfish actuation you don't know if you're being selfish? I really, I really don't know if I had gone and bought a whole new wardrobe with it, but man, I just did my hair. And he had pizza real estate agent. They had sold a big house that week, so we had enough money for me to afford it. Okay,",symp/reasoning,192_49,P,cd,-3.0,"Arrey yaar, I'm just being Selfish, how do you even tell if you're being selfish? Honestly, I'm not sure if I should have splurged on a whole new wardrobe, but bro, I just got my hair done. And that dude was a pizza real estate agent. He had sold a bada sa ghar that week, so I had enough paisa to buy it. Fine, chill."
50,"so instead of thinking I'm selfish, what could you actually think?",routine,192_50,T,irq,0.0,"Toh mere selfish hona ke bajay, tum kya soch sakte ho?"
51,I deserve this and then how me sometimes,routine,192_51,P,id,-3.0,Mujhe iska hak hai aur phir bhi kabhi kabhi mujhe
52,I deserve this?,inactive,192_52,T,crq,0.0,Kya mujhe ye layak hai?
53,Yeah.,inactive,192_53,P,cd,0.0,Haan.
54,"I mean, who doesn't deserve something every now and then. Right? ",inactive,192_54,T,gc,0.0,"Mera matlab hai, kaun nahi karta kuch na kuch toh kabhi kabhi. Sahi hai na?"
55,Yeah.,inactive,192_55,P,ack,0.0,Haan.
56,"Okay, so if you were thinking I deserved that. That was your thought when he was getting angry. He thought no, I'm sorry. This How do you think that would actually Make you feel what kind of emotion would you feel at that point? I drives you so confident?",routine,192_56,T,ap,0.0,"Theek hai, toh agar tum soch rahe the ki mujhe woh haq hai. Woh tumhara khayal tha jab woh gussa ho raha tha. Usne socha, nahi, maafi chaha tha. Yehi toh hai ki mujhe kaise lagne lagega? Kis tarah ka emotion tumhe us waqt mehsoos hoga? Kya yeh tumhe itna yakeeni bana dega?"
57,"Yeah, confident in my decision. I would still feel real sad that paint off But I don't think it would be to the level that it was thought was selfish.",routine,192_57,P,od,-3.0,"Haan, maine apni faisla par barosa hai. Main abhi bhi sach sach dukhi feel karungi ki paint off hua hai lekin mujhe lagta nahi hai ki woh woh level hoga jaise ki khayal kiya gaya tha ki yeh swarthi tha."
58,"So if you felt competent about your decision, because you actually changed your thought, do you think that would in turn change your behavior instead of you actually get an angry you would think there's no need for this?",routine,192_58,T,orq,0.0,"Toh agar aap apne decision ke baare mein confident mahsoos kar rahe the, kyunki aapne apne khayal ko badal diya tha, toh kya aap samajhte hai ke isse aapki harkatein badal jaayengi aur gussa nikaalne ke bajaay aapke mann mein yeh khayal aayega ke iski koi zaroorat nahi hai?"
59,"Yeah, I think it would help me realize that that's his issue and not mine",routine,192_59,P,gc,-3.0,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki yeh mera issue nahi, balki uska issue hai aur mujhe yeh samajhne mein madad karega"
60,Right. So how do you think you'd actually behave them?,routine,192_60,T,irq,0.0,Theek hai. Toh tum kya sochte ho ki tum unhe asal mein kaise karoge?
61,"walk off, okay or he will  be able to  This is kind of what I'm wanting to get to, as well be able to suppress it and No, man He didn't deserve for me to hit him. He didn't. He said something that upset me, but no one deserves that.",routine,192_61,P,id,-3.0,"Chal, theke chal, teek hai ya usse ho sakta hai ki main is taq pahuncho. Main ye chahta hoon ki main usse dabba kar sakoon aur nahi, yaar usse mujhse maar khaane ka koi haq nahi tha. Woh kuch aisa keh gaya jo mujhe naraz kar diya, lekin kisi ko aisa haq nahi hai."
62,"Right. So maybe I'm so thinking also that you're selfish when he's getting my back. Could you do you think maybe you could say to yourself instead of me, he just doesn't understand and maybe I need to tell him that I do deserve this. And explain it to him that this makes me feel good about myself. ",routine,192_62,T,gc,0.0,Thik hai. So maybe mai bhi soch rahi hu ki tum khudgarz ho jab wo mere saath hai. Kya tum mere jagah khud hi soch sakte ho ki wo samajh nahi raha hai aur mujhe hi pelega? Aur usse batla do ki mujhe yeh deserve karti hu aur yeh mujhe khud pe garv dilata hai.
63,"Yeah, yeah, I could try that. ",routine,192_63,P,cr,0.0,"Haan, haan, main woh try kar sakta hun."
64,"Because, you know, you know, you're not selfish. It's just something that makes you feel good. ",routine,192_64,T,gc,0.0,"Kyunki, tu jaanta hai, tu jaanta hai, tu khudgarz nahi hai. Yeh ek aisi baat hai jo tera accha feel karati hai."
65,"And I think also, he understood why I did it. Because I mean, he knows that I have some subconscious issues, but I don't think he realizes how bad it was or why I got my hair cut encasing it as she said the most girly things you never asked me feel better about myself, you know, not be as well. Okay. Which goes back to this precedent. So Right. Okay.",symp/reasoning,192_65,P,gc,-3.0,"Aur mujhe lagta hai ki, usse samajh aa gaya ki maine yeh kyun kiya. Kyunki main to yeh chahti thi ki woh samjhe ki mere andar kuchh anek ehesaas hain, par maine nahi socha ki woh kitna bura tha aur kyun mere baal kaat diye uske roop mein aur woh kahein see girlish cheezon ko bol kar main khud ko sudhar saku, aap ko pata hai, aisa nahi ho sakta. Theek hai. Yeh precedent par laut aati hai. Very Good. Theek hai."
