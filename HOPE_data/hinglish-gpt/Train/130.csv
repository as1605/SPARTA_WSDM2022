0,"So let's talk about this. So those type of thoughts, like I can't make a mistake or something like that. We call this automatic thoughts. And we'll have plenty of time talk about the different structures in CBT. I do want to explain it to you but over the course of several sessions, let's just take pieces of it for now. Okay. So far we believe is that your beliefs combined with a situation and create these thoughts. So you have this belief, so you're laying in bed for work, and you have this belief that you're maybe not competent. And then the situation that combines with that is, it's time to go to work. So the stress of No, it being time to actually get up and get ready to work. And then you have an automatic thought in that moment. Can right now it's one tied to dread and fear. Let's try to identify an exact one for this example. So let's use that scenario. You believe that you might not be confident you're laying in bed, and the alarm clock goes off. So you're kind of pressured to make a decision about do I get ready for work or not? What's the thought right then?",routine,130_0,T,id,,"Chalo baat karte hain iske baare mein. Aise hi vichar jisme main koi galati nahi kar sakta ya kuch esa hai. Hum ise 'automatic thoughts' kehte hain. Aur hum CBT mein alag-alag sanrachnayon ke baare mein baat karenge. Main aapko iske baare mein samjhane ki koshish karoonga lekin muqammal sessionon mein, abhi sirf thode hisso ko pakad ke dekhte hain. Theek hai. Abhi tak to humein yahi lagta hai ki aapke vishvas, ek paristhiti ke saath jud kar ye vichar bana lete hain. To aapke pas yeh vishvas hai ki aap shayad kabil nahi hai aur fir wah paristhiti jo uske saath judi hui hai ye hai ki kaam ke liye taiyaar ho. Isse aas paas ka daab stress hota hai, aur waqt aa raha hai ki kaam shuru hone ke liye taiyar ho jao. Aur us samay aapke dimag mein automatic thought aata hai. Ho sakta hai abhi yeh insaaniyat se dapakta hua ho aur dar ke saath jura ho. Ek vaarishthya dena ki koshish karte hain is udaharan ke liye. To chalo hum us halaat ka istemal karte hain. Aapka vishvas hai ki aap shayad atmanirbhar nahi hain, aap khwaab mein pade hain aur alarm baj raha hai. To aapke upar dabav hai ki kaam ke liye taiyaar ho jao ya nahi? To tabhi aapke vichar kya hai?"
1,"if I go to work I'm going to make a mistake,",symp/reasoning,130_1,P,id,-2.0,"Agar main kaam par jaaungi to main galti kar dungi,"
2,"So if I go, I'm going to make a mistake. And then we talked about your reactions being late. Worry, anxiety. So what we'd like to do when we identify on that felt like that is what's called self talk. And it first this may seem a little odd, right? So you have this thought that comes through it can be an image to the thought image. But it's cognitive in nature. And I can't make a mistake, like, I'm going to make a mistake. I'm going to make a mistake. That's your thought. And the self talk. This is like a rehearsed statement that you literally say to yourself, which again, I get to that seems so odd The first time I do it. So really, you're talking to yourself But over time, we believe if you can keep applying the self talk strategy that you will eventually change the outcome, the reaction and change the underlying belief. Okay? It first though it's going to seem quite foreign to you. Tell me how you how you're processing this now. ",routine,130_2,T,id,,"Toh agar main jaaonga na, toh main zaroor galti kar dunga. Aur fir humne teri late reaction ke baare mein baat ki. Chinta, chinta. Is liye hum chahte hain ki jab hum use pehchaane, toh yeh woh hai jo self talk kehte hain. Aur yeh sabse pehle thoda ajeeb lag sakta hai, sahi hai? Toh iss mein ek khayaal aata hai ki yeh khayal hota hai. Lekin yeh cognitive hai. Aur meri kismet mein koi galti nahi hai, main galti kar dunga. Main galti kar dunga. Yeh tera khayaal hai. Aur yeh self talk. Yeh toh hai jaise rehearsed statement jo tum khud se bolte ho, jo mujhe firse itna ajeeb lagta hai. Lekin waqt ke saath, hum believe karte hain ki agar tum self talk ki strategy lagatar apply kar sakte ho, toh tumhari outcome, reaction aur belief dono mein badlav aayega. Theek hai? Lekin pehle toh yeh sabse ajeeb lagne wala hai tumhe. Batao, ab tum isey kaise process kar rahe ho."
3,"So I mean, what am I supposed to say to myself?",routine,130_3,P,crq,,"Toh main kya bolun, khud se khud ko kya kehna chahiye?"
4,"It's a good question. We'll work on that. And that's what we can do now. Let's take a look at some self talk. So some adaptive responses so they can build. So I'm going to make a mistake. That's the automatic thought that's directly leading. Seems to be to feeling supported dread, and physically not getting work on time. Has there ever been times when you've had that thought? And you went to work on time still? ",routine,130_4,T,id,,"Yaar achha sawaal hai. Hum us par kaam karenge. Aur ab hum jo kar sakte hain, woh dekhte hain. Chalo khud se baat karte hain. Kuch aadarsh pratikriya hai jisse ve unhe banaya ja sakta hai. Toh main ek galti karunga. Woh swaayamvargi vichaar hai jo seedhe se mujhe dharan kar raha hai. Lagta hai ghabrayiye samarthit vichar, aur waqt par kaam na karne ka sharirik demotivation hai. Kya kabhi aapne waise samay mein woh vichaar rakha hai? Aur phir bhi waqt par kaam kiya?"
5,Yeah.,inactive,130_5,P,op,,Haan.
6,What was different about those times?,routine,130_6,T,irq,,Unho gaya ki uss samay mein kya alag tha?
7,"I guess I told myself, I have to get to work on time because if I don't, it's going to be even worse. If I make a mistake, and I'm late that it just, you know, it compounds and I guess I would tell myself, it's gonna be okay. You just have to get through this day. ",symp/reasoning,130_7,P,id,-2.0,"Mujhe lagta hai ki maine apne aap se kaha, mujhe samay par kaam par pahuchna hoga kyunki agar main nahi pahuncha toh ye aur bhi bura hoga. Agar mujhse koi galati ho gayi aur main der se pahucha toh, pata hai, woh badh jaati hai aur mujhe apne aap se kaha hoga, sab thik ho jayega. Tum bas iss din se guzar jao."
8,"Alright, so when you do that, in essence, you are applying self talk. Okay. All right. So that's, that's really the same thing except you probably didn't have a label for it. And when you apply that it seems to work. So the message you're kind of sending yourself now you're telling yourself is I'm going to make a mistake still. But if I'm late for work, I'll be worse. So there's a little bit of positive and negative in here. Right self talk doesn't have to be all positive self talk needs to be, I think when anything realistic and sometimes realistic includes a little negativity. I'd rather focus on the more positive elements as we build this as possible though, so that's pretty good self talk you have now let's work on refining it a little bit to maximize its benefit.",routine,130_8,T,id,,"Theek hai, to jab aap woh karte hain, mool bhavna mein, aap apne aap ko samajhate hain. Theek hai. Chalo. To wohi cheez hai, bas ho sakta hai ki aapke paas iske liye ek label na ho. Aur jab aap yeh lagate hain to kaam karta hai. To ab aap khud ko bhej rahe hain yeh message hai ki main abhi bhi galti karunga. Lekin agar main kaam ke liye late ho gaya to vyakit hoga. To yahaan thoda sa positive aur negative dono hain. Khud se baat karne mein sirf positive nahi hona chahiye, khud se baat to hai, mujhe lagta hai ki kuch realistic hone chahiye aur kabhi kabhi thoda sa negativity bhi realistic hoti hai. Main is par zyada negative nahi hona pasand karunga jab jab hum yeh banate hain ki yeh asmbhav lagta hai, to yeh kaafi acchi khud se baat hai, ab chalo is par kaam karte hain ki isko aur refine karke iski faayde ko adhik se adhik banaya jaa sake."
