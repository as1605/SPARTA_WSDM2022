2,I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.,inactive,54_2,T,gt,,Main theek kar raha hoon. Shukriya puch ne ke liye.
3,What's been going on this last week?,symp/reasoning,54_3,T,irq,,"""Is hafte kya kuch chal raha hai?"""
4,"Um,",inactive,54_4,P,gc,,"Kya hai,"
5,"I've just been feeling like kind of in a rut. I mean, I've been looking for a job and hadn't really gotten anywhere and then the",symp/reasoning,54_5,P,id,,"मुझे अभी-अभी एक दरार महसूस हो रही है। मैं मतलब, मैं नौकरी की तलाश में था और वास्तव में कहीं भी नहीं पहुंच पाया था और फिर"
6,I had a drink the other night. And I just felt like,story,54_6,P,id,,Mujhe kal raat peene ka mann kar raha tha. Aur mai bas waise hi mehsoos kar rahi thi.
7,"that like me not having a job and going out and having that drink. Like I just, it wasn't deserved, and I just felt like such a loser because I should have that was the time that I should have been at work. If I had a job and instead I was at the bar drinking. So I had one drink, and then Ellen two Do another because then I just felt worse. And I figured I had one. So come on.",story,54_7,P,id,,"voh ki mere paas koi naukri nahi hai aur mai bahar jaake us ek drink ko pi raha hun. Jaise hi mai ne us drink ko piya, mujhe ehsaas hua ki uske laayak nahi tha aur mujhe khudko bahut haari hui mehsoos hua kyonki mujhe us samay kaam pe hona chahiye tha. Agar mere paas ek naukri hoti to main bar mein drink nahi kar raha hota. To maine ek drink liya, fir Ellen ne do aur le liya kyunki fir mai aur bhi bura mehsoos ho gaya. Aur mujhe laga ki ek se zyada mujhe nahi lena chahiye. To chalo."
8,So how much should you drink in total?,symp/reasoning,54_8,T,irq,,Toh tumhe kitna pi lena chahiye poora mai?
9,I think I lost track after four or five.,symp/reasoning,54_9,P,id,,Mujhe lagta hai ki main char ya paanch ke baad track kho diya.
10,But How long had it been since you had a drink? before that?,symp/reasoning,54_10,T,irq,,Par tumhe kitna samay ho gaya tha jab tumne sharab pee thi? Usse pehle kya tha?
11,"I did really well. I it was, I think like three weeks,",symp/reasoning,54_11,P,id,,"Maine sachhi me bohot acha kiya. Muje uska lagta hai, mujhe tino hafte lage."
12,three weeks or so. She did really well. And then you had you had one drink. And that just made you feel like you weren't successful.,symp/reasoning,54_12,T,gc,,kuchh teeno hafte nahi milenge. Usne sach mein accha kiya. Aur phir tumne ek drink liya. Aur voh bas tumhe yeh ehsaas dilaya ki tum safal nahi the.
13,I felt like a loser,routine,54_13,P,gc,,Mujhe ek haarne waala lag raha tha
14,felt like a loser.,routine,54_14,P,gc,,Mujhe loser ki tarah mehsus hua.
15,And you feel that kind of led to drinking some more. So you had a rough time with things?,routine,54_15,T,yq,,Aur tuh lagta hai ki yeh wajah se aur pee raha tha. Toh tuhe problems the na?
16,"Yeah, yeah.",routine,54_16,P,ack,,"हाँ, हाँ।"
17,what now,inactive,54_17,T,irq,,Ab kya?
18,"I mean, now I just kind of I don't I'm afraid to go back like I'm afraid to go out with, like some friends. They invite me out to dinner. But I know there's alcohol. And",story,54_18,P,id,,"Mera matlab hai, ab main bas, mujhe dar hai ki main wapas na jaun, jaise hi mujhe dar hai bahar jane se, meri kuch doston ke saath. Vo mujhe dinner ke liye bulaate hain. Lekin mujhe pata hai ki vahan sharaab hogi. Aur..."
19,is that where you were when that first strike? was out with friends?,routine,54_19,T,yq,,kya wahi thi jahaan jab woh pehla strike hua tha? dost ke saath bahar the?
20,Yeah.,inactive,54_20,P,ack,,Haan.
21,So there's a few things going on.,routine,54_21,T,gc,,Toh kuch cheezein ho rahi hain.
22,"We've talked in the past, right about separating the behavior from the person. Right? So, behavior is what we do, not who we are. You remember those discussions? And correct me if I'm wrong with sounds like I'm using different words than you use. But it sounds like when you had that first drink, you're kind of ashamed that you had a drink and you had it during the time when you would have been working.",story,54_22,T,yq,,"Hamne pichhle mein baat ki thi, sahi toh behavior aur vyakti ko alag karne ke baare mein. Sahi hai na? Toh, behavior hi hai jo hum karte hain, hum jo hain nahi. Kya tum yaad karte ho woh charche? Aur mujhe sahi kar do agar galat hoon, jaise ki mujhe lagta hai ki main alag shabdon ka istemaal kar raha hoon jo tum istemaal karte ho. Lekin mujhe aisa lagta hai ki jab tumne pehla glass pee, toh tumne us par sharam ki hai aur tumne use woh samay par piya jab tum kaam kar rahe hote."
23,"Yeah, that's pretty accurate.",inactive,54_23,P,ack,,"Haan, woh kaafi sahi hai."
24,"That's pretty accurate. All right. So taking yourself kind of back to that moment. All right, we we had that first. That first drink like you finished that first drank",story,54_24,T,gc,,"Yeh bahut sahi hai. Theek hai. To apne aap ko us lamhe tak leke jaao. Theek hai, humne us pehle tasbeer ka sharaab pee liya."
25,What was your What was your thought at that at that moment?,routine,54_25,T,irq,,Tumhara tumhara at that time tere vichar kya hua tha?
26,"Just like shameful. Like I did really, really well. And then here I was. I just finished a drink and I knew I wanted another one. ",story,54_26,P,id,,Bilkul ki tarah. Main ne sach mein bahut accha kiya. Aur phir yahan main tha. Main ne ek drink khatam ki aur mujhe pata tha ki mujhe ek aur chahiye hai.
27,"Okay, so shameful is kind of like the feeling. But the thought is I did really, really well. Right? ",symp/reasoning,54_27,T,crq,,"Theek hai, yeh to bilkul besharmi ki tarah hota hai. Lekin soch hai ki maine sach mein, sach mein achha kiya hai. Haan?"
28,"So that's what your thinking was. I did really, really well.",routine,54_28,T,irq,,"To aapka wahi socha voh tha. Main ne sach mein, bohot acche se kiya tha."
29,"And what? was that the end of the thought, or was that was there more before you had that next trick?",routine,54_29,T,irq,,"Aur kya? Kya yeh soch ka ant tha, ya phir uske pehle kuch aur tha jab tumne woh agla jadoo kiya?"
30,I guess just I was doing well. And then I had a drink and I just felt like an awful person. So I figured what was the hurt Having more,symp/reasoning,54_30,P,cd,,"Mujhe lagta hai main ache se kar raha tha. Fir maine ek drink li aur mujhe aisa laga ki main ek bura insaan hoon. To maine socha ki kya fark padta hai, aur leli aur thoda zada dukh hua."
31,"sort of sequence would have been you had to drink. You felt shameful. At the same time you're thinking that you were doing really well. And then just really, as you said before, you just felt like a loser. And then you decided, might as well just have the second drink. So another thought might be that, like, I might just have a second drink.",story,54_31,T,yq,,Noun asi tarah apko pee laina chahiye tha ki apko piyasa mehsus hua. Apko lajja bhi hui. Aiysi hi waqt meh ap samajh rahe the ki ap bahut acha kar rahe the. Phir hamesha ki tarah ap ghatia mehesus krna shuru kr dety the. Phir uske bad ap ne phaisla kia ki jo hae asaan kr doosra bhi pee lyn. To koi doosri khayal hae ki mein bhi bas doosra peg pi lon.
32,"Yeah, ",inactive,54_32,P,ack,,"Haan,"
33,"yeah. So you can see others some thoughts and some feelings at work. right as you finish that first drink was a fairly quick, but those thoughts feelings fairly. occur fairly quickly after the drink.",story,54_33,T,crq,,"yeah. Toh aap dekho others kuch thoughts aur kuch feelings at work. Right jab aap us first drink ko khatam karte ho, woh kaafi tezi se, but woh thoughts aur feelings kaafi tezi se hoti hai. Yeh thoughts aur feelings tezi se woh drink ke baad hoti hai."
34,"Yeah, absolutely. As I was finishing and then finished,",routine,54_34,P,ack,,"Haan, bilkul. Jaise hi main khatam kar raha tha aur phir khatam hua."
35,"so right away, you regret it and that regret As you thought about it,",routine,54_35,T,crq,,"To jaldi hi, tum usse afsos karte ho aur wo afsos tumhare dimaag mein baith jaata hai jab tum uske baare mein sochte ho."
36,"don't might as well just just continue drinking now, because you kind of blew it.",routine,54_36,T,cd,,"अब ड्रिंकिंग जारी रखने की कोई जरूरत नहीं है, क्योंकि आप थोड़ा सा गलती कर"
37,"I already messed up, I might as well keep going. ",routine,54_37,P,od,,"मैं पहले ही ग़लत काम कर चुका हूँ, तो अब और जारी र"
38,Okay.,inactive,54_38,T,ack,,Thikay
39,"And that's a common cycle to fall into. And you had three weeks, we hadn't had a drink prior to that. So let's, let's look at this. Let's try to separate the behavior from the self a little bit. If you had if you had a friend who was in the same predicament, right, you had a history of using alcohol and then at three weeks, without any alcohol use, and then their behavior was to have a drink. What would you think of them?",story,54_39,T,orq,,"Aur vo ek aam pravaah hai jisme giraavat aana aasan hai. Aur tumhaare paas teen hafto tak koi peene ki aadat nahi thi. To chalo, isko dekhte hai. Chalo, apne vyavhaar ko aatma se thoda alag karne ki koshish karein. Agar tumhaare ek dost ki bhi yahi haalat hoti, jiske pehle se sharab ka istemaal tha aur phir teen hafton tak usne koi sharab nahi pi, lekin phir bhi uska vyavhaar sharab peene jaisa ho. Tum unke baare mein kya sochoge?"
40,I think that they had a rough day or something was to happen where,story,54_40,P,od,,Muze main lagta hai ki unke pas ek difficult din tha ya kuch hone wala tha jaha pe.
41,"I mean, it's just wondering,",routine,54_41,P,od,,"Mera matlab ye hai, bas soch raha tha."
42,"I had a rough day one drink, and what would you think of their behavior? How would you categorize that behavior?",routine,54_42,T,irq,,"Mere paas ek kharab din tha, ek drink ki, aur aap unke vyavhaar ke baare mein kya sochenge? Aap uss vyavhaar ko kis tatv par adhikarit karenge?"
43,That's just they made a mistake.,routine,54_43,P,id,,Vohi bas uktha ke kuṇṭa ke huṃ kuṇṭa k
44,"So not ideal,",routine,54_44,T,crq,,"Toh kuch nahi ideal hai,"
45,"depending on their point of view, maybe a little irresponsible.",routine,54_45,T,crq,,"Unke nazariye ke anusaar, shayad thoda anaitik hona."
46,"Yeah, I think irresponsible,",routine,54_46,P,cd,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki ye bahaal behuda hai."
47,"irresponsible, but you wouldn't necessarily characterize them as a bad person. ",routine,54_47,T,yq,,"Irresponsible, lekin aap unhe ek bure insaan ke taur par nahi shreni-baddh karenge."
48,No.,inactive,54_48,P,on,,Nahi.
49,But their behavior was a bit of responsible.,routine,54_49,T,yq,,Lekin unka vyavahar thoda responsibly tha.
50,Yeah.,inactive,54_50,P,on,,Yeah. Yeah.
51,"You know, in terms of like the recovery plan, which would be to not drink.",routine,54_51,T,irq,,"Tu jaante hai, recovery plan ki baat kare to, jisme sharaab na piya jaaye."
52,"But when you apply that same example examination to your own situation, how do you characterize yourself after you had that first drink?",routine,54_52,T,irq,,"Par jab aap apne situation mein wohi udaahran par apply karte hain, toh pehle sharab pee kar aap khud ko kaise describe karte hain?"
53,It was my mistake it was in it. It makes me a worse person for doing it.,routine,54_53,P,id,,"यह मेरी गलती थी, इसमें मुझे सुधारने की आवश्यकता है। ऐसा करके मैं बुरे इंसान का दिखता"
54,"So you see how you're you're being a little bit quite a bit rougher on yourself. Like your your evaluation of yourself is, is fairly harsh. You mentioned loser earlier and ashamed.",routine,54_54,T,gc,,"Toh tum dekho na ki tum apne aap par thoda bohot zyada sakht ho jaa raha hai. Jaise tum apne aap ko judge kar rahe ho, woh bohot zyada kathor hai. Tumne pahle haarne wale aur sharminda hone ki baat ki."
55,Whereas you wouldn't necessarily evaluate someone else that way. ,routine,54_55,T,irq,,"Hinglish:
Lekin agar tum aise tarike se kisi aur ko nahi tay karte ho."
56,How would you evaluate your behavior? How would you How would you judge your behavior taking that first drink?,symp/reasoning,54_56,T,irq,,Tum apne vyavahar ka mulyankan kaise karoge? Pehle sip se apna vyavahar judge karne me tum kaise honge?
57,"shameful. I mean, irresponsible, which is bad overall.",symp/reasoning,54_57,P,id,,"Sharam ki baat hai. Main toh laparwahi ka matlab jaanta hoon, jo ki saarvajanik taur par bura hai."
58,"So, so bad, irresponsible, shameful.",inactive,54_58,T,crq,,"Achha, bahut hi bura hai, bekar, anaitik, lajja janak."
59,"Is there a way to separate that behavior in terms of in terms of your thinking, the way you evaluate it from yourself, like are you into behavior?",symp/reasoning,54_59,T,irq,,"Kya koi tarika hai jisse aap us vyavahar ko alag kar sake, jisme aap apne vichar aur tark ki drishti se use apne aap se alag kar sake, jaise ki aap us vyavahar mein vyast hain?"
60,together a meshed or can you be separated?,symp/reasoning,54_60,T,irq,,क्या तुम साथ में एक साज में भी जुड़ सकते हो
61,"I think we could be separated But it, it feels like we're like I am that behavior",symp/reasoning,54_61,P,id,,Mujhe lagta hai ki hum alag ho sakte hain Par yeh aisa lagta hai ki hum aise hain jaise main wohi vyavahar kar rahi hoon
62,in that moment. It's very congruent for you.,routine,54_62,T,gc,,Uss pal main. It's very हमदर्द for you.
63,"Yes, ",routine,54_63,P,ack,,"Haa,"
64,"the shame matches the behavior to behavior matches shame. Like it's there one at that moment. Mm hmm. But really, logically, rationally, you're you, Ryan, your identity and values and your behavior, something you do.",story,54_64,T,gc,,"Sharam, shame to behavior matches it. Jaise ki woh ek pal ki hai. Mm hmm. Lekin sahi, tarkik taur pe, aap ho, Ryan, aapki pehchaan aur aapki aadarsh aur aapka vyavahar, kuchh jo aap karte hain."
65,"But in the moment, it's hard for you to see that.",routine,54_65,T,gc,,परन्तु अभी की पल आपको इसे देखना मुश्किल होता है। But abhi ki pal aap
66,Mm hmm. Looking back on it now is are you able to see the distinction between what people do and what they are?,routine,54_66,T,irq,,"Haan, ab jab mein usse yaad karta hoon, kya aap fark dekh paate hain logon ke kaam aur woh kya hain?"
67,"Yeah I mean, just because you have one drink doesn't make you a horrible person and",routine,54_67,P,id,,"Haa bhai bas yaar, ek drink toh maari hai tu ne, toh humesha se hi bura insaan nahi ban jaata."
68,"no, certainly not. And you were, you were clean for three weeks, and you had one drink. So really, your behavior was a slip.",symp/reasoning,54_68,T,gc,,"Nahi, bilkul nahi. Aur tum, tum teen hafte se saaf the, aur tumne ek drink ki. Toh haqeeqat mein, tumhara vyavahar ek mistake thi."
69,"Right It was and irresponsible in relationship to your goals, I suppose. But still a slip. And you could have stopped. But that shame got ahold of you. Right. I thought, well, now I've done it. I blew it. Yeah. So with that mentality, you kind of set yourself up for drinking more. So, I think this is important because we've seen this cycle like where you have weeks of sobriety, and then we'll drink a bit and then have weeks as writing. And I'm wondering if part of the difficulty you're facing is you're not coping with the slips as just slips",story,54_69,T,gc,,"Right ya to kadapiyo bekaar tha, mai mana karta hu. Par ek baar ki galti hai. Aur tum rok sakte the. Par tumhe haya sharm nahi aayi. Right. Maine socha, ab aag lag gayi. Mai haar gaya. Haan. To us mentality ko yaad karke, tune apne aap ko aur bhi zyada peena ke liye taiyar kar rakha hai. Isi liye, mai sochta hu ki yeh zaruri hai kyunki humne yeh cycle dekhi hai jisme tum hafton tak alkohol peena chhodte ho, fir thoda sa peete ho aur fir likhte ho. Aur mai yeh soch raha hu ki tumse mushkil ho rahi hai kyunki tum slips ko sirf slips ki tarah nahi samajh rahe ho."
70,okay.,routine,54_70,P,ack,,thik hai.
71,You're allowing them to be gateways into a lot more drinking than the slip. Does that make sense? That That's pretty accurate.,routine,54_71,T,id,,तुम उन्हें बहुत अधिक पीना का द्वार बनने देने की अनुमति दे रहे हो। क्या यह समझमें आता है? वह बहुत सही है।
72,"And you see how the shameful feelings kind of just interfere with the behavior that you really want that's really consistent with their goals, which would be to not continue drinking. ",routine,54_72,T,gc,,"Tum dekhte ho na ki jaisa sharmana bhawukh hone ke karan, tumhe sahi karwahi karna bhatak jaati hai, wahi tumhe apne lakshya ke saath sahi tarike se rahne se rokta hai, jo ki piyakar na badhne ka hota hai."
73,Mm hmm.,routine,54_73,P,cd,,"""Hmm, haan."""
74,"Another piece of this too is the association associating with friends who drink, you're putting yourself in a treacherous situation. Again, that's a behavior.",routine,54_74,T,gc,,"Is situation mein dosto ke sath piye jaane wale ka rishta bhi ek bada tukda hai, jisse aap khud ko khatarnak halat mein daal rahe ho. Fir se kehte hain, yeh ek karna hai."
75,Right? That doesn't make you one way or the other. It's a behavior. How would you judge that behavior going out with friends?,symp/reasoning,54_75,T,irq,,Sahi na? Woh tere ko ek taraf ya doosri taraf karne se bana diya nahin hain. Yeh ek vyavahaar hai. Kaise tere us vyavahaar ko judge karega jab friends ke saath bahar jaa raha hoga?
76,"I don't know. I mean, difficult because I like being around those people. But I guess it would be it's risky.",symp/reasoning,54_76,P,on,,"Mujhe nahi pata hai. Main toh kehta hoon, thoda mushkil hai kyunki mujhe woh logon ke saath rehna pasand hai. Lekin main samajhta hoon ki yeh khatarnaak hai."
77,"risky, okay. It's a risky behavior. And what does it make you Who are you? Because you do that behavior. Like how do you feel about yourself? When you take that risky, behavior, ",routine,54_77,T,irq,,"Risky, theek hai. Yeh ek risky behaviour hai. Aur isse tum kya ban jate ho? Tum kaun ho? Kyunki tum yeh behaviour karte ho. Jaise ki tum khud ke baare mein kaise mehsoos karte ho? Jab tum woh risky behaviour karte ho."
78,"guilty, ",symp/reasoning,54_78,P,id,,"thappar,"
79,okay,inactive,54_79,T,ack,,thik hai
80,"So you have guilt when you go out with your friends. And then you have shame if you drink. And both, in this case, both emotions that kind of point you in the direction of more drinking. So part of this behavioral strategy here is to avoid the circumstances like to recognize that's a risky behavior, which you have. And the other part would be to deal more effectively if you do slip away, right. Does that does that separation of what we do and who we are? makes sense to rationally?",story,54_80,T,irq,,"So, jab tum apne doston ke saath bahar jaate ho, tumhe guilt hoti hai. Aur phir jab tum peete ho, tab tumhe shame hoti hai. Aur dono hi emotions, iss case mein, tumhe aur zyada peene ki taraf point karte hai. Is behavorial strategy ka ek hissa yeh hai ki aise situations se bachne ki koshish karenge, jaise ki risky behavior ko pehchaan na. Aur dusra hissa hai ki agar tum uss rishte se door nikal jaaye, toh uss situation se thik tarah se deal karenge. Kya yeh alag alag hai ki hum kya karte hai aur hum kaun hai? Kya yeh hamein sense mein aata hai rationally?"
81,kind of,routine,54_81,P,id,,थोड़ा स
82,"feels a little unnatural, though.",routine,54_82,T,yq,,"Thoda ajib lag raha hai, par suvyavashtha ke hisab se thik nahi"
83,Yeah.,inactive,54_83,P,ack,,Haan.
84,Yeah.,inactive,54_84,P,ack,,Haan.
85,"So maybe, as you're confronting",story,54_85,T,gc,,"To shayad, jaise tum samna kar rahe ho"
86,"similar situations in the course of the next week, You could be aware of behaviors that might put you at risk, and try to try to separate your identity from that behavior. So, so just judge the behavior. Okay. Right. And don't don't pass any judgment on yourself.",story,54_86,T,gc,,"Aane wale saptah ke course mei aapko ek jaisi sthitiyaan ho sakti hain, aap khud ko khatre mein daalne waale kuch vyavhaaron se jaan sakte hain, aur apni pehchaan ko us vyavhaar se alag karne ki koshish kar sakte hain. Isliye, bas vyavhaar par judge kijiyega. Thik hai. Aur apne aap par koi bhi judgement na lagaiye."
87,So that makes sense.,inactive,54_87,T,crq,,इसलिए ठीक है।
88,Kind of Yeah.,inactive,54_88,P,ack,,Kuch Yeah.
89,It might help you to.,inactive,54_89,T,od,,Yeh tumhari madad kar sakti hai.
90,"Since it's a little tough to because right now, the feeling and the judgment, retro twined. Right. It might help to write down when these things happen, and kind of write down like, like one row for this is how I judge this behavior. But I'm thinking about doing and this is how I judge myself. So if you see a lot of self judgment, that might be a clue that you're falling into a cycle a little bit,",story,54_90,T,od,,"Abhi thoda muskil hai kyunki iss waqt, feeling aur judgment ek saath aur jud gaya hai. Theek hai. Yeh madad kar sakta hai ki jab yeh cheezein ghatna shuru ho toh, unka likhna shuru kar do, aur thoda se ek row mein bhi likh do ki main iss rawayat ko kaise judge karta hu. Lekin main soch raha hu ki yeh karke dekhu ki main yeh kar raha hu aur main khud ko kaise judge kar raha hu. Agar tumhe apne aap ko bahut judge karte hue dekho, toh yeh samajhne mein ki tum ek cycle mein gir rahe ho, ek suraag ho sakta hai."
91,Okay,inactive,54_91,P,ack,,Thik hai
92,where you're making decisions based on that emotion instead of a rational judgment and behavior.,story,54_92,T,od,,"Jab aap uss emotion par nirdhaarit faislo ka adhaar karke, uske sthan par viveki nirnay aur vyavahar par dhyaan nahi de rahe hai."
93,"Okay, ",inactive,54_93,P,ack,,ठीक
94,that helped a little bit.,inactive,54_94,T,yq,,Wo thodasa madad ki.
95,"Yeah, I think that would probably be beneficial.",inactive,54_95,P,ack,,"Haan, maine socha ki yeh prbaabbaly faydemand hoga."
96,So that'll be our plan going forward. ,inactive,54_96,T,gc,,To tab hamara aage ka yojna hoga.
97,"Until next week is note document your judgment about your behavior, any judgment you may have about yourself. Right, and there's some insight that can be gained there. Right.

Thik hai. Dono ko alag karne ki koshish karte hue, woh evidence istemaal karne ki koshish karo jab tak koi nirnay lene se pahle jo tumhari chabi hai, usme risky jagah par na pahuch jaaye."
98,Okay.,inactive,54_98,P,ack,,Thik hai.
99,Sound like plan?,inactive,54_99,T,yq,,Kya plan lag raha hai?
100,"Yeah, I think I can try that.",inactive,54_100,P,ack,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai main woh koshish kar sakta hun."
101,"Okay, good. I'll see you next week. And we'll see how you did with those goals.",inactive,54_101,T,gt,,"Acha, achha. Main phir milunga tumse agle hafte. Aur dekhnge ki tumne un lakshyon se kya kiya hai."
102,Okay,inactive,54_102,P,gt,,Okay ठी
103,summary,"The patient feels they have been in a rut last week. They haven't gotten a job and have felt like a loser for drinking once. But the patient seems to drink more once they start since they feel like a loser. The patient is scared to go out with friends since there is alcohol. They recall a discussion with therapist saying they feel ashamed when they have the first drink. The patient feels really well but feels awful instantly after the first drink then they continue drinking as such. The patient identifies if someone else drinks after a rough day, they are a little irresponsible but not a bad person. However the patient call themselves bad, irresponsible and shameful for the same. The therapist clarifies to the patient that linking slips to shame makes the patient drink more. They act as gateways. The patient feels guilt when meeting friends and see it as risky. The therapist clarifies part of behavioral strategy is to avoid the circumstances like to recognize that's a risky behavior. The patient is asked to separate what we do and who we are. The patient is asked to write these things down this week and make decisions based on rational judgement and behavior instead of emotion. The therapist will meet the patient next week. ",,,,,
