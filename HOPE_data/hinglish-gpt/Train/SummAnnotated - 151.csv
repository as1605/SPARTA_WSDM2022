Um, so she has been nagging me for like weeks to come in and talk to you. So I figured I would just kind of come in just so she would stop bugging me about it.",story,151_3,P,id,0,"Translation:
Um, toh meri girlfriend ne aapki ad paper mein dekhi thi. Aur usne dekha ki aap kuch cheezon par kaam karte hain, jisme se ek hai smoking cessation aurisse meri girlfriend ko aaphi ki smoking se problem hai. Um, toh woh mujhe hafte bhar se nudge kar rahi hai ki main aapke paas aaun aur aapse baat karun. Toh maine socha ki main bas aapke paas aa jaun taki woh mujhe uske baare mein pareshan na karen."
4,So you came into therapy today? Because your girlfriend pressured you?,story,151_4,T,crq,0,Toh kya tum aaj therapy mein aaye? Kya tumhare girlfriend ne tum par pressure dala tha?
5,"Yeah, I mean, it's just it's easier for me like if I come in here and talk to you like That's it. I can spend like 45 minutes with you compared to ours or her nagging me through the week so",story,151_5,P,cd,0,"Haan, matlab, mujhe yeh aasan hai ki agar mein yahan aa kar tumse baat karun toh bas yehi hota hai. Main tumhare saath 45 minute bita sakti hu, jabki humare ya uski tarah mere saath hafte bhar ki taang aane se bach jati hai."

8,"and what she would like you to do, and this is her goal, not yours would be to stop smoking. Yeah. Tell me what your goal is?",symp/reasoning,151_8,T,gc,0,"Aur woh chahegi ki tum kya karoge, aur yeh uska maksad hai, tumhara nahi hoga smoking chodna. Haan. Mujhe batao tumhara maksad kya hai?"
9,"I don't really have one. Like, I don't think smoking is that bad. Well, I mean, smoking can be bad, but like it doesn't it's never bothered me like I I don't know. It's like, I really don't have any goals to come in besides just having herself on you may.",symp/reasoning,151_9,P,id,-1,"Mujhe actually koi hum nahi hai. Jaise, mujhe lagta nahi ki smoking itni buri hai. Haan, main manta hu, smoking kharab ho sakti hai, par mere liye kabhi koi problem nahi bani hai. Pata nahi, aisa lagta hai, mujhe actually kuch bhi goal hum nahi hai, sirf tumare saath rehne ka maza le rahi hu."
10,So do you have a goal of quitting smoking?,symp/reasoning,151_10,T,yq,0,"Hindi translation

क्या आपका धूम्रपान छोड़ने का एक लक"
11,"No, not at all. Now there's I don't know. There's like so many good things about smoking. I get one what really got me into it was I smoke a lot at work because it gives me like one on one time with the boss. So like the fact that I can get that time with my boss is make worth it. ",symp/reasoning,151_11,P,on,-1,"Nahi, bilkul nahi. Ab mereko pata nahi hai. Waise toh smoking ke bare mein bahut acchi baatein hai. Mujhe jo sach hai usmein interest le aaya woh hai woh me office mein bahut smoking karta hu, kyunki boss ke saath mujhe ek ek ho kar wakt milta hai. Toh meri ability fact itni hai ke mein woh boss ke saath woh time pas kar sakta hu jo mereko laayak hai."
12,Can you tell us some of the not so good things about smoking?,symp/reasoning,151_12,T,irq,0,क्या आप हमें सिगरेट पीने के बारे में कुछ अच्छे नहीं बातें बता
13,"Um, I it's just a, it's how I meet people. So like, if I like, I'll have cigarettes on me, but like, I don't have a lighter and that kind of like keeps me from finishing off the pack. Because I can finish off a pack a day. But if I don't have a lighter than, like, I carry the cigarettes around with me. And then if I see other people are smoking, I can go and ask for a lighter and that's always kind of went away and to get to these groups and I've just met so many different people from from smoking like",symp/reasoning,151_13,P,id,-1,"Arre bhai, yeh to bas aise hi hai, yeh mere liye logon se milne ka tarika hai. Toh aise, agar mujhe pasand aa gaya, toh mere paas cigarettes hai, par lighter nahi hai aur phir pack khatam karne se rokta hai. Kyunki main din mein akele ek pack finish kar sakti hoon. Par agar mujhe lighter na mile toh, main cigarettes saath mein lekar ghoomti hoon. Aur agar main dekhu ki koi aur bhi cigarette pee raha hai, toh main jake unse lighter maang sakti hoon aur usse kitna accha tarika hai logon se milne ka, isiliye maine bhi aur bhi logon se ristedaar banaya hai smoking se."
14,"So smoking, the way you're presenting it, there's been a positive thing in your life ?",symp/reasoning,151_14,T,yq,0,"To yeh smoking, jaise tum ise lekar prastut kar rahe ho, kya ye tumhara jeevan mein ek sakaratmak baat hai?"
15,"Yeah, I mean, like I only do it socially. So that's Yeah.",symp/reasoning,151_15,P,op,0,"Haan, main, like main bas socially karta hoon. To woh haan hai."
16,Are there any negative aspects to smoking?,symp/reasoning,151_16,T,irq,0,Kya smoking karne mein koi negative prabhav hote hain?
17,"I mean, yeah, I mean, everyone, everyone knows smoking is unhealthy. But like I don't, I don't smoke a lot. Like I only only smoke from time to time and it's mostly just on the weekends. So it's like, I don't know, occasionally I go by smoker for the weekends, I might have like a cough. Maybe I get like a heavy cough on Mondays Tuesdays, part of me is gone by Wednesday. So it's not really that big of a deal.",symp/reasoning,151_17,P,id,-1,"I mean, haan, I mean, sabko pata hai ki smoking sehat ke liye hanikark hai. Par mere case mein, I don't, main zyada smoke nahi karta. Bas kabhi kabhi smoke karta hoon aur woh bhi mostly weekends mein hi. Toh jaise, main jaanta nahi, kabhi kabhi mere weekends ke smoker hone ki bajah se mujhe cough ho jaata hai. Shayad main Monday or Tuesday ko heavy cough hota hai, magar Wednesday tak woh chala jaata hai. Toh it's not really a big deal."
18,So you don't seem like you're too worried about the negative aspects ?,symp/reasoning,151_18,T,irq,0,Toh kya tumhe lagta nahi hai ki tum negative pahluo se bahut pareshaan ho?
19,"Now. I mean, like the obviously is unhealthy. But like one of the things I'm trying to do in my life now is get out there and meet new people and like the benefit of being able to do that smoking is better than like giving it up for health reasons. I think.",symp/reasoning,151_19,P,id,0,"Ab. Main hai, jaise ki clearly aapki sehat ke liye harmful hai. Lekin mere zindagi mein ek baat karne ki koshish kar raha hu ki naye logon se milu aur iske faayde ki baat agar smoking karne se ho toh health reasons ke liye chhod dena se behtar hai. Mujhe lagta hai."
20,"So I wanna ask you a question. I want you to give a response between one and 10 as is called scaling And it's to do with the importance of stopping smoking. So one would be, it's not important to, and 10 would be, it's extremely important to you, where do you think you'd put that number? ",symp/reasoning,151_20,T,gc,0,"Mai tumse ek sawaal poochna chahta hu. Mujhe tumse ek jawaab chahiye ek se das tak jo scaling kehte hain aur yeh cigarette chhodne ka mahatva ke saath juda hai. Ek se das mein ek tumhare liye bohot zaroori nahi hoga aur dus do se, lekin das agar tumhare liye bohot hi important hoga, toh tum kya number daaloge?"
21,"I don't know. Maybe like, like a two. like it'd be cool to get rid of the cough on Mondays but that getting rid of that is not worth everything else I get from smoking.",symp/reasoning,151_21,P,id,-3,"Mujhe nahi pata. Shayad kuch aisa, do lagta hai. It'd be cool hai cough ko Mondays se dur kar dena, par wo dur kar dena sab cheezon ki kurbani nahi hai jo mujhe smoking se milta hai."
22,So not particularly important?,symp/reasoning,151_22,T,crq,0,Kya koi khaas maayne rakhta hai?
23,Yeah,symp/reasoning,151_23,P,cd,0,haan
24,"Now, let me ask you the same question except instead of importance, how confident are you about confidence? How confident are you that you could quit smoking on a scale of one sound one being not confident all and 10 being extremely confident.",story,151_24,T,gc,0,"Ab aapko ek aur sawal puchhu, par is baar ahmiyat ki jagah, apni khudki pratibha ke bare me puchhta hoon. Apni aashwasan par kitna bharosa hai? Smoking chodne ke liye aapko kitni pratibha hai ek se dus tak? Ek se dus ke beech ka darja muhavara hai, ek se bilkul bhi aashwas ke beech."
25,"I could say probably like an eight or nine like I could I could give it up actually I gave it up recently like for like a month and I didn't even crave it but eventually like just seeing all my friends got smoking like I missed that. So I just started off again, but I don't know if I like if I really wanted to give it up. Forget I'm sure I could",story,151_25,P,id,-3,"Khair, main toh keh sakta hoon ki mujhe lagbhag aath ya nau lag sakte hain, main de sakta hoon yeh ke mai abhi haal hi mein chhod diya par ek mahine tak mujhe koi aakarshan hi nahi hua. Par dheere dheere apne dost sab dekhkar smoking kiya karne lagta hoon, aur mujhe woh cheez yaad aa gayi. Toh main phir se shuru kar diya. Lekin mujhe yeh nahi pata ki kahin zor zabardasti se kar raha hoga main. Bhul jao yaar, main sure hoon ki main kar loonga."
26,"So stopping smoking is not important to you, but you're fairly confident you could if you decided to quit. So, based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesn't seem like you're interested in stopping smoking, what would be a goal? How could we spend this time so that it would be productive?",symp/reasoning,151_26,T,gc,0,"So chhodna cigrette ka tumhare liye avashyak nahi hai, lekin tum kaafi vishwaas se bhara ho ki tum chhod sakte ho agar tum chaahe toh. Toh, uske hisaab se jahaan tak tum ho, tumhe cigrette chhodne mein koi ruchi nahi hai lagta, toh ek lakshya kya ho sakta hai? Hum is samay ko kaise bita sakte hai taki yeh upyogi ho?"
27,"I don't know. Like, I guess it would It would help to be able to, like explain to my girlfriend that like the stuff that I get from smoking and like you You seem you kind of seem like you get it so like, I don't know, maybe figure out ways to like explain to her the things that I get from smoking to like, I don't know just kind of help her like realize why I do it other than just to kill myself.",symp/reasoning,151_27,P,id,-3,"Mujhe kya pata hai. Jaise, mere khayal se yeh meri girlfriend ko samajhne mein madad karega ke meri cigarette peene se mujhe kya milta hai aur tum toh aise lagte ho ke tum samajh rahe ho, isliye shayad usko samjhane ke tarike dhundein ki mujhe cigarette peene se kya fayde hote hai, bas khud ko maarna ke alawa."
28,So to help her to understand why smoking works for you.,symp/reasoning,151_28,T,crq,0,"To usko samajhne me madad karne ke liye, smokeling ki wajah kya hai."
29,Yeah.,symp/reasoning,151_29,P,cd,-,Haan.
30,"That's that's one goal than any other goals you could think of I mean, you came in, in part because you're well, that seemed to appear like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured you. ",story,151_30,T,crq,0,"Haan, ye ek goal hai jo dusre kisi goal se bhi zyaada important hai. Mera matlab ye hai ki tum andar aaye, kisi had tak isliye bhi kyunki tum well ho, aur ye mujhe dikh raha tha ki tum poori tarah se apni girlfriend ki pressure mein andar aaye ho."
31,Yeah.,story,151_31,P,cd,0,Haan.
32,So any other relational goals you might want to work on there?,story,151_32,T,irq,0,Kya tumko wahin par aur koi rishtedaari se judi goal ki zarurat ho sakti hai jispar tum kaam karna chahte ho?
33,"Well, no, we haven't really been like we've been fighting a lot because of the smoking. So I think like, maybe figuring out ways like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fights in a way like I don't ascribe that but like having fights that are productive like that just don't always end like with us just like going our separate ways or like one of us leaving the house but like, I guess being able to like wrap up a fight so it doesn't last for like days.",story,151_33,P,id,-1,"Arey, nahi, hum kab se itni zyada ladte aa rhe hai, kyuki smoking ke karne ki wajah se. Toh mujhe lgta hai ki, shayad humko kuch tareeke dhundhne chaiye, jisse hum apas mein behtar se communicate kar sake ya fir hum ek dusre se acchi tarah lade, lekin fir bhi hum door toh nahi ho jate ya ghar chod kar chale jate hai, balki aise lade jo productive ho, jisse hum dono ke beech mein kuch sudhar ho. Aur mujhe toh yeh bhi dhang se nahi lagta ki bas ladaai khatam kar dete hai aur fir hum alag alag ho jate hai, balki ek tarikese comprise karke ladaai ko khatam kar diya jaye jisse wo dino tak na chale."
34,So productive communication and productive arguments,story,151_34,T,crq,0,इतना productive communication और productive arguments बहुत उपयोगी
35,"right yeah, yeah. ",story,151_35,P,cd,0,"Theek hai, haan."
36,So so one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend.,story,151_36,T,orq,0,"So ek
 goal toh ye ho ki aap apni girl friend ko smoking ke benefits acche se illustrate kar paye  | 
सो इतना एक गोल होगा कि आप अपनी गर्लफ्रेंड क"
37,Right,story,151_37,P,od,0,Thik hai
38,She understands how important it is to you,,151_38,T,crq,0,Vo samajhti hain keh aapke liye yeh kitna ahem hai.
39,Yeah.,,151_39,P,cd,0,Haan.
40,"Because it does seem like it's really important to you. But another would be to work on your relation, your relational style, so that you, you can end argument and feel like you're not at a stalemate?",story,151_40,T,crq,0,"Kyonki tumhare liye sachmuch mahatvapurna lag raha hai. Par dusra yeh hai ki tum apni rishte ki taraf kaam karo, apne rishton ke tareeke par kaam karo, taki tum jhagda khatm kar sako aur aisa na lage ki tum phans gaye ho?"
41,"right Yeah, yeah, I think that'd be cool. ",story,151_41,P,cd,1,"Haan, haan, mujhe lagta hai vo achha hoga."
42,"All right. Well, you want to make those two goals. We work one so we can spend this time going up too fast. ",story,151_42,T,gc,0,"Acha. Thik hai, tu chahta hai ki dono nirnay le. Hum ek nirnay lete hai taaki hum yeh waqt jaldi se kharch na kare."
43,"Yeah, I can do it that it's kind of like killing two birds with one stone.",story,151_43,P,gc,0,"Haan, main kar sakta hu jisse ye ek tarah se do kaam ek saath ho jaye."
44,"Does that make sense to me. Well, that's what we'll do. So what I'd like to do, I'll see you again and about a week. ",routine,151_44,T,gc,0,"Kya mujhe samajh aata hai? Toh wohi hum karenge. Toh jo main karna chahta hu, hum phir milte hai ek hafta ke baad."
45,"Right, right. ",routine,151_45,P,gc,0,"Theek hai, theek hai."
46,So if you could reflect on some of these changes you think you can make with this relationship where you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator. Because a lot of this revolves around communication.,story,151_46,T,gc,0,Toh agar aap kuch iss badloav par chintan kar sakte ho jisme aap iss rishte mein ek zarooriyaat se acche communicater ban sakte ho. Kyuki bahut saari cheesein iss bat par nirbhar karti hain ki aap kaise communicate karte ho.
47,yeah,story,151_47,P,gc,0,haan
48,"communicating the advantages of smoking, but also communicating in the arguing, so that you have productive end to these arguments, right. So it's really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result. ",symp/reasoning,151_48,T,gc,0,"स्मोकिंग के लाभों को संवादपूर्वक प्रवर्तित करना, लेकिन साथ ही झगड़ा में संवाद भी करके आप इन विवादों का निर्माणशील अंत तक पहुंचे, सही है। इसलिए यह वास्तव में विवादों"
49,"Yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool. We can do that. ",symp/reasoning,151_49,P,gc,1,"Haan. Haan, woh khub hoga. Hum woh kar sakte hain."
50,"Okay. So if you could work on kind of thinking that through, and then next time we meet, we'll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes in that relationship to to meet those goals. ",story,151_50,T,gc,0,"Thik ha. Toh agar tum use soch ke kaam kar sako, aur phir agle baar hum mile toh hum us rishte mein ke alag-alag aim ke baare mein baat karenge aur shayad usme kuch chote-chote badlav karne ke tarike sochen."
51,Right. All right. Sounds good.,story,151_51,P,gc,0,Theek hai. Sab theek. Shuni bhari lagyo.
52,All right. Thanks for coming in Kylie.,inactive,151_52,T,gc,0,Thik hai. Kylie aane ke liye thank you.
