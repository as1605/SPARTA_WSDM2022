0,"So Sam is healthy other than some seasonal allergies and everything else Okay, then.",routine,83_0,T,irq,,"Toh Sam thik thak hai except kuch khasi-jukam ki samsya aur baaki sab Theek hai, phir bhi."
1,"Actually, not quite. I don't know what's been happening but between last school year and this year, all of a sudden I'm getting these phone calls from his teacher saying that he's not paying attention in class. They think he has ADHD all of a sudden. I mean, I don't know where this is coming from. But this is not the same kid I had a year ago.",symp/reasoning,83_1,P,id,-2.0,"देखिए, इस बारे में थोड़ा-थोड़ा। पिछले स्कूल साल और इस साल के बीच कुछ हो गया है पता नहीं, लेकिन आचानक मुझे उसके शिक्षक से फोन आ रहे हैं कि वह कक्षा में ध्यान नहीं देता है। उनको ऐसा लगता है कि वह अचानक से ADHD है। मतलब, मुझे तो यह स्पष्ट नहीं है कि यह कहाँ से आ रहा है। पर यह वही बच्चा नहीं है जो मैंने एक साल पहले"
2,"Okay, so sounds like there's a little bit more going on that and some more worries that you wanted to talk about. So perhaps it makes sense that, that we take a few minutes and then I chat with you, and then I'll spend a few minutes with Sam. Sure. It'll be great. Okay, Sam, do you want to go in, hang out in the waiting room for bed and I'll come find you in a few minutes. Go ahead, honey. So tell me about Sam and the issues that he's having in school.",routine,83_2,T,irq,,"Okay, toh lagta hai ki isme kuch zyada hi baatein ho rahi hain aur kuch aur chintaayen hain jinke baare mein aap baat karna chaahte hain. Toh shayad thoda sa theek ho ki hum kuch minute baat karein aur phir main aapke saath baat karun aur fir main kuch minute Sam ke saath guzaarun. Theek hai. Sam, tum bed ke liye intezaar mein aaram karne jao, main tumhe kuch minute mein dhoondhungi. Jaa, baccha. Toh batao mujhe Sam aur uske school mein kya issues hain."
3,"Well, he's like a totally different kid and not in a good way. All of a sudden, this year, I've been getting calls three, four times a week from his teacher, the principal. They're saying things like he's acting out in class. He's having little kind of angry spurts. All of a sudden, he's not doing his homework, which is completely new to me. His grades are slipping. I mean, he used to be like, 70s 80s 90s kids. Now he's getting 60s. So this feels like",symp/reasoning,83_3,P,id,,"Uffo, voh ek poori family Indian masala hai jo bilkul alag bachcha hai, lekin bilkul sahi tarike se nahi. Achanak, iss saal se hafte mein teen-chaar baar mere teacher aur principal se phone aa rahe hain. Unkehte hain voh class mein aaram se nahi baith sakta. Voh thoda gussa bhi karta hai. Aur abhi se, voh apna homework nahi kar raha hai, aur yeh bilkul naya cheez hai mere liye. Uske grades bhi girne lage hain. Pehle voh 70s, 80s, 90s ke bacche the. Ab voh 60s le raha hai. Ab toh lagta hai ki sab kuch kahe na toh?"
4,"a real diversion from last year real change from last year. Oh, totally like night and day. Okay, so it sounds like there's been some problems at home. So I'm going to ask you some screening questions that I asked all the parents, some of them might fit for you. And some of them may not probably take about five minutes, and we'll just go through them together. Sure, let's do it. So why don't we start with how you're doing?",routine,83_4,T,irq,,"Ek sachha bhedhak pichle saal se asli parivartan hogaya hai. Oh, bilkul raat aur din ki tarah. Theek hai, aisa lagta hai ki ghar mein kuch problem hui hain. Toh main aap se kuch screening sawaal poochungi jo main sabhi maatapitro se poochti hoon, kuch unse aapke liye fit honge aur kuch nahi honge shayad. Aur yeh poora aapke saath paanch minute lagega, hum saath mein unse jayenge. Zaroor, chalo karte hain. Toh kyun na hum shuru karein ki aap kaise feel kar rahe hain?"
5,"Um, honestly, I'm getting by. I mean, I think you know, Darrell and I got divorced last year. He's somewhere out in BC God only knows where.",symp/reasoning,83_5,P,id,-1.0,"Hm, sach mein, main chal rahi hoon. Matlab, mera khayal hai, tum jaante ho, Darrell aur main pichle saal divorce ho gaye. Woh kahin BC mein honge, khuda hi jaane kahan."
6,"So is he seeing Sam at all, or?",routine,83_6,T,yq,,"Kya woh Sam ko dekh raha hai, ya phir?"
7,"I think they Skype maybe once every couple months, but he's really not been in contact. And he's not been sending the money that he promised he would. So we're not thrilled with him right now.",symp/reasoning,83_7,P,id,,"मुझे लगता है कि वहें हो सकता है कि हर जोड़े महीने में एक बार Skype करते हैं, पर वह अभी तक संपर्क में नहीं है। उसने वादा किया था कि वह पैसे भेजेगा, पर आपूर्तिकर्ताओं के साथ हम वह प"
8,So has that meant that finances have been tight or?,symp/reasoning,83_8,T,irq,,To kya ye matlab hai ki finances tight ho gaye hai ya?
9,"Yeah, I mean, I was kind of counting on the child support to come in. You know, things are tight with three people household and then For almost since long, Darren's been gone. My mother has also moved in with me. She, you know, as you get older, she's starting to get a little bit more dementia. Some people just stick their parents in a home but I was the good daughter and I decided to take her into mind.",symp/reasoning,83_9,P,id,-1.0,"Haan, main toh, mai khel rahi thi ki bachhe ka sahyog aayega. Pata hai, teen logon ke parivaar mein phansi huwi hai aur phir, lambi samay se Darren chale gaye hain. Meri maa bhi mere saath shift ho gayi hai. Woh, tum jaante ho, jaise jaise umar badhti hai, usko thodi si dimentia hone lagi hai. Kuch log bas apne maa-baap ko ghar pe chord dete hain par main toh achi beti hu aur maine socha use apne saath rakh lu."
10,"So lots of changes, lots of things going on. Yeah. And how do you feel like you're managing with all that?",routine,83_10,T,orq,,"Toh bohot saare badlav ho rahe hai, bohot saari cheeze ho rahi hai. Haan. Aur tujhe kaisa lag raha hai, ki tu sabke saath achhe se chala raha hai?"
11,"I mean, some days are obviously better or worse than others it's been a lot of changes like you said, I mean, I'm not getting enough sleep I'm things are tight financially.",routine,83_11,P,od,-1.0,"Matlab, kuch din toh obvious tarah se behtar ya bura hote hai, jaise tumne kaha ki bahut saari changes ho gayi hai, matlab, mujhe achhe se neend nahi aa rahi hai, mere paise bhi tight ho gaye hai."
12,"Emotionally, how have you been doing them and managing things are ",routine,83_12,T,irq,,Aap emotionally kaise kar rahe hain aur cheezein sambhal rahe hain?
13,"you know sometimes very stressful, like if my mother has an episode or when I get called from school, but like, I don't think I'm really like depressed or anything, it just it's kind of day to day thing.",routine,83_13,P,id,,"Tu jaanta hai kabhi kabhi bahut stressful hota hai, jaise agar meri maa ke saath kuchh ho jaye ya jab mujhe school se phone aaye, par main nahi lagta hoon ki main sach mein depressed hoon ya kuchh bhi, bas yeh ek din-ba-din ki chij hai."
14,"So there are ever any times that you're not managing well, like you're not good at able to get out of bed or do the things that you need to do in a day.",routine,83_14,T,irq,,"Toh kya kabhi kabhi aisa hota hai ki tum apna kaam nahi sambhal paate ho, jaise tum bed se uthne mein ya roz kaam karne mein achhe nahi ho."
15,"There's a couple mornings that I sleep in, but it's really like I still kind of get by I get everything done I need to like, I know it's kind of a tough time right now but I don't feel like it's gonna be hopeless forever. Hopefully.",routine,83_15,P,id,-1.0,"Mujhe kuch subah utne ki aadat hai par mujhe aisa lagta hai jaise ki thoda sa kaam kam kar sakta hoon, main jo bhi zaroorat hai wo puri kar leta hoon, main jaanta hoon ki abhi mushkil waqt hai par mujhe lagta hai ki yeh haal hi nahi rahega. Umeed hai."
16,"So some struggles but yeah, okay. Do you ever cope with using drugs or alcohol?",routine,83_16,T,yq,,"Some jhanjhat toh hain lekin haan, theek hai. Kya aap kabhi sharab ya madak padarth ka istemaal karke cope karte hain?"
17,"No, I mean my mother used to drink but I tried to be really aware of not using that as a crutch.",routine,83_17,P,on,,"Nahi, mera matlab hai ki meri maa peete thi par mai bahut dhyan rakhne ki koshish karta tha ki mai use ek sahaara ke roop mein istemaal na karu."
18,So then no drinking at all at home?,routine,83_18,T,crq,,To waise kya ghar pe bilkul bhi sharab nahi leni hai?
19,no drinking and I definitely don't want drugs in the house for the kids. So none of either.,routine,83_19,P,cd,,Ghar mein koi pee nahi aur main bilkul baccho ke liye dawaiyaan nahi chahta. Toh koi bhi nahi.
20,What about making sure that Sam and your little one have what they need in terms of winter coats or food or or those sorts of things?,routine,83_20,T,irq,,"What if we take care to ensure that both Sam and your little one have everything they require, such as winter coats, food, and similar essentials?"
21,"I I'm doing the best I can you know, like, we haven't gotten a chance to get winter coat shopping yet. His from last year still kind of it It's not great but it's solution for now.",routine,83_21,P,id,-1.0,"Main agar tujhe pata hai, main apni taraf se sabse achha kar raha hoon, jaise, hum abhi tak winter coat shopping ke liye mouka nahi paaye hain. Uska coat pichle saal ka hi hai aur thoda kharaab hai, par abhi ke liye yeh samasya ka hal hai."
22,So he's wearing his coat from last year. Yeah. Do you have a sense about is that hard because of finances are there other reasons,routine,83_22,T,crq,,Toh woh apne last saal ka coat pehen rakha hai. Haan. Kya tumhe andaza hai ki kya ye mushkil hai kyun ki paise ki vajah se ya koi aur vajah hai?
23,"mostly finances but I mean kind of time too like to get everybody out the door to go grocery shopping or go clothes shopping. It's a big ordeal. Right? I mean, I know. We didn't pick up everything he wanted her back to school this year either. It would be easier to add a few extra dollars in a few extra hours.",routine,83_23,P,cd,,"Jyadatar paisa lekin mamla sameaye ke tarah hai, bazar jaane ya kapde kharidne ke liye sabko bahar nikalna padta hai. Ye bahut bada kaam hai na? Mujhe pata hai. Is saal humne use jo chahiye tha wo nahi liya tha school ke liye laane ke liye. Kuch extra paise aur kuch extra samay daalne se achha hota."
24,Right. So Sam's not always having the things that he needs right now then.,routine,83_24,T,crq,,Theek hai. Sam kabhi kabhi uske paas vo cheezein nahi hoti jo usko abhi chahiye hai.
25,I guess not exactly. No.,routine,83_25,P,on,,Mera guess thoda exact nahi hua. Nahi.
26,Yeah. And what about you know food or you deserve food in the fridge? Are you able to put food on the course,routine,83_26,T,irq,,"Haa. Aur tere bare mein baat karte hai, kya tu fridge mein khana khaane layak hai? Kya tu course par khana daal sakta hai?"
27,"I mean, we have the bulk foods were membership. So when we do get out I let Sam pick out things he likes to make, you know, macaroni stuff for sandwiches, cereals. That way, you know sometimes he makes himself breakfast in the morn. before school or dinners,",routine,83_27,P,id,,"Mai toh matlab karti hoon, humare pass bulk foods ke membership hai. Isliye jab hum bahar jaate hai, mai Sam ko chune dene deti hoon un cheezo mein jo use pasand hai, pata hai, sandwiches aur cornflakes banane ke liye. Aise hi, kabhi kabhi wo apne liye nashta banata hai subah school se pehle ya khana."
28,And what kinds of things does Sam have for dinner?,routine,83_28,T,irq,,Aur Sam ke dinner mein kya kya cheezein hoti hai?
29,"Like I said, like he'll do macaroni. You know, sometimes it's not great, but I'll do like the fruit or, you know, sometimes some snack food, sometimes more comprehensive meals, I guess.",routine,83_29,P,id,,"Jaise maine kaha tha, vaise hi wo macaroni karega. Tumhe pata hai, kabhi kabhi yeh accha nahi hota, par main phal ya koi nashta le lungi, ya fir kabhi kabhi puri khaana bhi."
30,I was what would you say he does? Is he cooking? Or are you cooking or both?,routine,83_30,T,irq,,"Mai to fir bhi puchh rahi thi ki woh kya karta hai, kya woh pak raha hai? Ya phir tu pak rahi hai ya dono saath me?"
31,"I guess kind of a mix of both. To be honest, like,",routine,83_31,P,id,,"I guess dono mein se thoda-sa mixture hai. Sacchai to bataun to, jaise ki,"
32,"So with all the stress in the house, has there been any times that people have kind of gotten really upset with Sam or yelled at them or said mean or hurtful things to him?",routine,83_32,T,irq,,"इस तरह जब घर में सब तनाव होता है, क्या कभी किसी ने सैम पर खूब गुस्से किया या उनके साथ गैर-असुविधाजनक बातें कही या नुकसान पहुंचाई?"
33,"Not really. I mean,",routine,83_33,P,id,,"Bilkul nahi. Matlab ki,"
34,And what about how his discipline handled in your house? Has anybody ever spanked or hit or physically hurt Sam in any way?,symp/reasoning,83_34,T,yq,,Aur kya aapke ghar mein uske anushasan ko kaise vyavahar kiya gaya? Kya kabhi kisi ne Sam ko maara ya chot pahunchai ya sharirik roop se nuksaan pahunchaya hai?
35,"No, never. I mean, I used to give him timeouts when he was younger, but",symp/reasoning,83_35,P,on,,"Nahi, kabhi nahi. Main matalab, jab vah chhota tha tab main use timeout deti thi, lekin"
36,"What about sexual abuse? Has anyone touched Sam in a sexual way or an inappropriate way? Excuse me? Yeah, that's a hard question to hear for lots of people. But I asked everybody that question,",routine,83_36,T,irq,,"Sexual abuse ke baare mein kya? Kya koi ne Sam ko sexual tarike se ya anaryapt tarike se chhua hai? Maafi chahiye? Haan, yeh ek mushkil sawaal hai bahut saare logon ke liye sun-ne ke liye. Lekin maine har kisi se yeh sawaal pucha hai."
37,"so no, no, never. I I would never let that happen to my child. Okay.",routine,83_37,P,id,,"Nahi, nahi, kabhi nahi. Mai kabhi apne bachche ke saath aisa hone nahi dunga. Thik hai."
38,"So, so he's been safe from sexual abuse or from sexual appropriate touch. Okay. So how do you think Sam's doing in his close family relationships do you think Sam's feeling loved And supported.",routine,83_38,T,orq,,"Toh, toh wo sexual abuse ya sexual sahi sparsh se safe hai. Thik hai. To aapko lagta hai ki Sam apne pare parivar ke rishton mein kaise kar raha hai? Kya aapko lagta hai ki Sam ko pyaar aur sahyog ka ehsaas hai?"
39,"I mean, I know I guess I haven't really been around for him as much as I'd like to be obviously, I do the best to let them know we know how much I care for him. Sometimes we have a little bit more money, I can get him something nice that he wants. You know, I've heard him kind of, he's kind of a thought that Oh, you love the baby more than you love me. But that's that's obviously not true. I love both my kids.",routine,83_39,P,od,-1.0,"I mean, main jaanta hoon main sochta hoon ki mainne uske liye kaafi kam samay diya hai jaisa ki mujhe pasand hai, main unhe bataane ki poori koshish karta hoon ki hum jaante hain ki main kitna unse pyaar karta hoon. Kabhi kabhi jab hum thoda sa zyada paise paa sakte hain, main use kuch acha lekar deta hoon jo woh chahta hai. Tum jaante ho, maine suna hai ki woh sochta hai ki oh, tum baby se zyada mujhe pyaar karte ho. Lekin woh to bilkul nahi hai. Main dono apne bacchon se pyaar karta hoon."
40,So what do you think he would say if he was here? And I asked him if he felt loved.,routine,83_40,T,orq,,Toh tujhe kya lagta hai wo agar yahan hota toh kya bolta? Aur maine usey pucha ki kya usko pyaar mila?
41,I'd hope he'd say yes.,routine,83_41,P,od,,Mujhe umeed hai wo haan bol de.
42,There's some doubt?,routine,83_42,T,crq,,Kya kuchh shakahari hai?
43," I mean, like I said, like I'm",routine,83_43,P,cd,,"Mera matlab hai, jaise maine kaha, jaise main hoon."
44,You mentioned that there was some some some difficulties with your mom.,routine,83_44,T,crq,,Tumne kaha ki tumhari maa ke saath kuch thodi thodi pareshaniyan thi.
45,"Well, she's lived with us for the past year or so. She was diagnosed with dementia so she has days where she remembers Everything and days where she started to slip more and more. And she just she's very judgmental very opinionated. She has the way she likes things. And",story,83_45,P,cd,-3.0,"Toh, wo ek saal se aapke saath rahi hai. Usse dementia ka pata chala tha, isliye uske din hote hain jab wo sab kuch yaad rakhti hai aur din hote hain jab wo dheere dheere kam yaad rakhti hai. Aur wo bahut judgemental hai, apne opinion ko lekar. Uske paas apne tarike hain. Aur..."
46,has there been any time that your mom has become physically aggressive in the home?,routine,83_46,T,irq,,Kya kabhi aapke ghar mein aapki maa ne sharirik roop se hamla kiya hai?
47,"No, never.",routine,83_47,P,on,,"Nahi, kabhi nahi."
48,And what about her relationship with you? How is she managing or how are you managing together with her in the home?,routine,83_48,T,irq,,Aur uski aapke saath rishta kaise hai? Kya woh ghar mein aapke saath kaise nibha rahi hai ya aap unke saath sath sath ghar mein kaise nibha rahe hain?
49,"Some days are definitely better than others. She like, I guess you could say I kind of tried to check her behavior when she was getting a little bit",routine,83_49,P,id,,"Kuch din toh zaroor acche hote hain par kuch aur din bohot bure. Woh toh mujhe pasand hai, main samajhti hun ki mujhe uski harkaton par rokna tha jab woh zyada toucha ho rahi thi."
50,And Has it ever come to physical blows between the two of you?,routine,83_50,T,yq,,Aur kya kabhi aapke beech toh haathapaayi hui hai?
51,"No, no just arguments here and there.",routine,83_51,P,on,,"Nahi, nahi sirf yahan yahan arguments hain."
52,And when you mean arguments how intense are those arguments getting?,routine,83_52,T,irq,,"Aur jab aap arguments keh rahe hai, toh wo arguments kitne intense ho rahe hai?"
53,"Like we raise our voices I mean, it's I'm doing the best I can here",routine,83_53,P,id,-3.0,"Jaise hum apni awazien uthate hain, matlab main, main yahan se apne aap ko bakshaishi kar raha hoon."
54,Is it ever it's never come to physical blows?,routine,83_54,T,yq,,क्या कभी कभी शारीरिक झड़प तक कभी नहीं
55,"No, never. I'd have to take some other action if that happened.",routine,83_55,P,on,,"Na, kabhi nahi. Agar aisa hua toh mujhe kuch aur karna padega."
56,"And that, that that intensity, is that kind of like arguing or is it like yelling, screaming and door slamming or people throwing objects?",routine,83_56,T,irq,,"Aur yeh, woh intensity, woh intensity wahi darje ki hai, kya woh ladai jhagda ki tarah hai ya fir chillaane, cheekte aur darwaze khatkhatay ya log cheezein phenk rahe hain?"
57,"I guess you could say we've gotten pretty loud. I mean, she'll go and kind of slam things in her room. You know, I'm, I obviously I wouldn't ever let her hurt the kids.",symp/reasoning,83_57,P,id,-3.0,"Mujhe lagta hai hum bahot zor macha dete hain. Main maaan loon, wo apne kamre mein cheezein phadphadakkar rakh deti hai. Pata hai, main obviously kabhi bhi usse bachein ko nuksaan nahi hone deti."
58,And where are Sam and the baby when these things are happening?,routine,83_58,T,irq,,Aur Sam aur bachcha kahan hai jab yeh cheezein ho rahi hai?
59,"Sam will usually go and hide in this room, maybe turn this music up. You know, Lee's sometimes napping in the crib in the playpen, I guess to be totally honest, I do lose my patience and scream more than I'd like to but",symp/reasoning,83_59,P,id,,"सैम बाबा तो यहां लुक डालेंगे, इस रूम में, शायद ये म्यूजिक बढ़ा दे। तुम तो जानते हो, ली बाबा कभी-कभी क्रिब में सो जाते हैं और जंगली पुश्तिकरण में खेलते हैं। मुझे सच कहने के लिए बताना चाहिए कि मेरी"
60,"so it sounds like there's kind of a lot of tension and, and, and arguing in that relationship. How often would you say that that's happening that it comes to that kind of arguing and yelling place?",routine,83_60,T,irq,,Toh yeh lagta hai ki uss rishte mein tension aur jhagda bahut zyada hota hai. Kitna often hua karta hai ki aisa jhagda aur chillaane ki situation mein pahunch jaata hai?
61,I guess like a few times a week.,routine,83_61,P,id,,मुझे लगता है कि हफ्ते में अधिकांश
62,Can one sort of last question what has anyone in your family been in prison or in jail?,routine,83_62,T,yq,,Kya kisi ek tarah ki aakhri sawaal hai jisme kisi ko ek baar bhi jail mein ya jail mein rahna pada ho?
63,"No, never. ",routine,83_63,P,on,,"No, kabhi nahi."
64,"Okay. So thank you very much for sharing all of that. I'm just going to recap. Sounds like there's been a lot of stressors and lots of change over the last year. Yeah. Sam status moved away, which is kind of created some changes in finances, which have led to, maybe not always having the food or the clothing that you've needed or that Sam has needed. You've got, your mom has moved in, and there's some stress and tension and arguing that's happening in that. And you've also told me that maybe all of these stressors and stuff have contributed to Sam not feeling as loved or as cared for. On the other hand, it sounds like you're managing emotionally and that you're not using any drugs or alcohol. You have told me that there are no concerns regarding physical, emotional or sexual abuse. For Sam and his life, and that nobody in your family more in Sam's life has gone to prison. So I think you're right there is likely a connection between kind of what's happening for Sam in school and the difficulties that he's starting to have with all of these stresses and changes at home. So I'm going to book a follow up appointment for you and Sam to come in. And at that time, we'll talk about some of the ways in which I might be able to help or develop a plan together.",story,83_64,T,cd,,"Theek hai. Toh bahut dhanyavaad ki aapne itne saare baaton ko share kiya. Main sirf ek baar phir se recap karungi. Lagta hai ki pichle saal mein bahut saare stressors aur bahut saari parivartan hui hain. Haan. Sam ke status ne dur chale gaye, jo ki aapke finances mein kuch changes laaye hain, jiske karan, shayad aapko ya Sam ko khaane peene ya kapde ki zaroorat poori nahi ho paayi. Aapke mom ne ghar mein shift kar liya hai, aur wahan kuch stress aur tanav aur jhagde hote hain. Aur aapne mujhe bataya hai ki in saari baaton ne shayad Sam ko aapse pyaar aur parwah ka ehsaas nahi hone diya hai. Dusri taraf, lagta hai ki aap apne emotions ko handle kar rahe hain, aur koi nasha ya sharab nahi le rahe hain. Aapne mujhe bataya hai ki Sam ke zindagi mein koi bhi physical, emotional ya sexual abuse ki chinta nahi hai, aur aapke parivaar mein, ya Sam ke zindagi mein koi bhi jail gaya hai. Toh main sochti hoon ki aap sahi hain, ki shayad Sam ke school mein jo kuchh ho raha hai, usme ghar mein hone wale samasya aur parivartan ka koi na koi taalmel ho sakta hai. Toh main aapke aur Sam ke liye ek follow up appointment book karungi. Aur uss samay, hum yeh discuss karenge ki main aapki madad kaise kar sakti hoon, ya ham saath mein ek plan develop kar sakte hain."
65,Sounds Sounds good. Thank you. Okay.,inactive,83_65,P,gt,,Sounds achcha hai. Dhanyavaad. Okay.
66,All right. So make sure you make an appointment on your way out to come back in as soon as you can. Okay.,inactive,83_66,T,id,,Theek toh. Apna dhyaan rakhiye ki aap apni chutiye par wapas aakar jaldi se wapas aayein. Theek hai?
67,And you said you wanted to see Sam for a bit as well.,inactive,83_67,P,id,,Aur tune kaha tha ki tu thoda sa Samse milna chahta tha.
68,"Yeah. You gotta see Sam right now. And then when when I'm done, just make sure on the way that you talk to reception about making another appointment. Okay. All right. Exactly. Last All right. Okay. Thanks. ",routine,83_68,T,gt,,"Haan. Tumhe abhi hi Sam ko dekhna hoga. Phir jab mein xongaya, bas uss dauran ye dhyan rakho ki aap reception se baat karo aur dobara ek appointment banane ke liye. Thik hain. Theek hain. Sahi. Aakhiri Theek hain. Thik hain. Shukriya."
