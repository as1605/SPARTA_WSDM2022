Bas main vahan nahi pohoch paa raha hoon aur main iska pata nahi. Itna frustrate ho jaana bhi bahut alag baat hai. Ye to bilkul bakwaas hai."
6,frustated Trying to lose the weight. Now you'd said before that you had a specific number of pounds of specific amount of weight to lose. You still have that in mind?,symp/reasoning,107_6,T,yq,,"Kaafi Pareshan huaa hai, Wazn kam karne ke liye try kar rahe hain. Tumne pehle hi kaha tha ki tumhe koi specific wazan kam karne ka vishwaas hai. Ab bhi tumhe ye yaad hai?"

So I can do 20 that would be great.",symp/reasoning,107_7,P,op,2.0,"Mujhe 20 pound chahiye. I mean, main zyada chahta hu, par maine pehle bhi Zyada karne ki koshish kari hai par kuch Dino se zyada nahi kar pa raha hu, to kuch bhi kar sakta hu, to 20 pound toh acha hoga."
8,"Right, and you tried before? And what do you think got in the way?",routine,107_8,T,irq,,"Sahi hai, aur tumne pehle koshish ki thi? Aur tumhe lagta hai ki kya roka hua?"
9,I don't know. I guess it wasn't convenient. You know.,routine,107_9,P,id,-2.0,Main nahi jaanti. Mujhe lag raha tha yeh aasan nahi hai. Tu jaanta hai.
10,Yeah.,routine,107_10,T,ack,,Han bilk
11,"Just like something always gets in the way, you know, and then I lose focus. I'm not very good at staying focused on stuff like that.",routine,107_11,P,id,-1.0,Jaise ki kabhi-kabhi kuch bhi raasta banana padta hai aur phir main concentrate nahi ho pata. Mujhe concentrate rakhne mein kamzor hoon waise cheezon par.
12,Loss of focus. So you start trying to lose the weight and your focus gets disrupted.,routine,107_12,T,cd,,Khoyi hui dhyan. Islie aap motape ko kam karne ki koshish karne lagte hain aur apka dhyan ulat jata hai.
13,"And I forget and then I make you know, spaghetti casserole for six people and then I eat a lot of it and that's carbs and cheese and fat and then I, you know, will eat with my kids don't eat and then it's just like I forget that I'm supposed to be making healthy choices.",story,107_13,P,id,-1.0,"Phir main bhool jaata hoon aur phir tumhein yaad dilaata hoon ki shatapei kazaerol chhah logon ke liye aur phir main zyaada khaata hoon usmein taake aur paneer aur charbi hai aur phir main, jaanti ho, apne bachchon ke saath khaata hoon jo khaate nahi aur phir itna yaad bhi nahi rahata ki main swaasthvik vichaar uthaane ka sochna chaahta hoon."
14,"Alright, so you know, how to lose weight. And you know, you can lose weight. But your focus is a little off when you're trying and that's causing the problem. Could we break that goal of losing 20 pounds down into smaller units? Like say, five pounds",routine,107_14,T,id,,"Theek hai, tu jaanta hai, khaase vajan kam karna. Aur jaanti hai, tu apna vajan kam kar sakta hai. Lekin jab tu concentrate karne ki koshish karta hai tab teri nishaani thodi door hoti hai jiski vajah se problem ho rahi hai. Kyun na 20 pound kam karni ki yeh goal chhote se chhote hisso mein bantenge. Jaise 5 pound?"
15,Do you think?,routine,107_15,P,crq,,Kya tum sochte ho?
16,It's just something you can do.,routine,107_16,T,cd,,Ye karna sirf ek cheez hai jo aap kar sakte ho.
17,I am so busy,routine,107_17,P,id,,Main itna busy hun.
18,for once a week.,routine,107_18,T,id,,Ek hafte mein ek baar.
19,I probably do once a week,routine,107_19,P,id,,Mujhe hafte mein ek baar karna wahin hai.
20,"You mentioned the loss of focus is one problem. How about motivation, you feel motivated to move through all those steps like five pounds and five pounds and so on.",symp/reasoning,107_20,T,id,,"Aapne manna hai ki dhyanghaat ek samasya hai. Motivation ki baat karein, aapko saarein saadhanon ke saath badhte jaa rahe teen chaar paunon aur teen chaar paunon waali dharaa mein tarakki karneka avsar hai, kya aapko motivation mil rhi hai?"
21,"Right now, yes. I think I would need something to keep me going. You know, week to week,",symp/reasoning,107_21,P,id,,"Aabhi Haan, Mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe kuchh cheez chahiye jo mujhe chalne mein madad kare, jaise week to week."
22,a little bit of that something extra to help you stay motivated.,routine,107_22,T,cd,,"Thoda sa waisa kuchh aur, jisse aapko motivate rakhne mein madad mile."
23,"Yeah. Like, when your kid does \their homework early, you can give them a special treat for dessert like that helps, you know, keep it going.",story,107_23,P,id,2.0,"Hai. Jaise ki jab aapke bacche ka kaam pehle hi kar liya ho toh aap unhe mil sakte hain ek special treat ke dessert ki tarah hum yeh help kar sakte hain, jaanti ho na ki iss se woh dhyan rakhega."
24,"Okay. So some sort of activity or item that you enjoy, that you could reserve for when you reach that goal of say that the first five pounds",story,107_24,T,id,,"Theek hai. To koi aisa kaaryawahi ya cheez jo aapko pasand aaye, jise aap woh pehli paanch paunds pahunchnay ka yeh zimmedari laga lein."
25,"I would love I mean, I've just been so embarrassed, you know,",routine,107_25,P,id,-1.0,"Main bohut hi sharminda hoon, aap samajh rahe honge. Mujhe thoda love karna chahiye tha na."
26,All right. Do you have the activity or item in mind? We could put in place as something you could reward yourself with?,routine,107_26,T,irq,,Sahi hai. Tumhe us kaam ya item ke baare mein yaad hai? Hum ek cheez bana sakte hai jise tum khud ko badhai dene ke liye use kar sakte ho?
27,Like after the first five pounds?,routine,107_27,P,crq,,Kya pehle paanch pound ke baad?
28,"Well, there's a few ways we could do it. We could do that. So you reach five pounds. And then you can give yourself that reward work could be for something you do every day. If that day you're successful in eating the way you want, he would you think would motivate you more?",routine,107_28,T,cd,,"Well, hum kuch aise bhi kar sakte hain. Hum woh kar sakte hain. Toh aap ko paanch kilo tak pahunch jaana hoga. Fir aap ko apni reward mil jaayegi jo aap roz ki koshish ke liye hai. Agar uss din aap ne achi tarah se khana khaya hai toh jo shabd aap ko sabse jyada motivate karega woh kya hoga?"
29,Maybe something every day.,routine,107_29,P,id,,Shayad kuch na kuch har roz.
30,"Yes, you know, each and every day as you're trying to lose weight. You're aware. When that day comes to close if you had a successful night, they were a less than successful day, right? If you have a successful day, then you could engage in an activity or receiving items that we work out in advance that, you know, would motivate you.Right? ",story,107_30,T,id,,"Haan, tu jaantaa hai, har aur har ek din jaise tu wazan kam karne ki koshish kar raha hai. Tu samajhataa hai. Jab us din ka aakhir huaa to agar tu ne ek saphal raat ki thi, to kamyaab nahi thaa, hai na? Agar tu ne ek kamayaabaa din guzaar diyaa to fir tu dance ya kisi anyay activity kar sakta hai jo humne pehle hi decide kar li thi, tu jaantaa hai ki wo hame motivate kar sakti hai. Haan?"
31,"And that could be, you know, maybe watching like a favorite TV show. Okay, you know, because I don't watch TV at night, because I'm so busy cleaning up and everything. Maybe I could just take some time for myself, because I did something good. You know, I just watch a TV show.",story,107_31,P,id,2.0,"Aur voh ho sakta hai, jaanaab, jaise ki apni pasandeeda TV show dekhna. Thik hai, yaad rahe ke main raat mein TV nahi dekhta hoon kyunki main itni busy hoon saaf-suthri karne mein aur sab kuchh. Ho sakta hai main bas khud ke liye thoda waqt nikaal sakoon, kyunki ek achcha kaam kiya hai. Yaad rakhna, main bas ek TV show dekhunga."
32,"So let's let's do that. On a day, you know, towards the evening. When you know, you have had a successful day and by what time would you know, in the evening?",routine,107_32,T,irq,,"So chalo usko kar lete hain. Ek din mein, you know, sham ke time. Jab aapko pata ho ki aapne ek successful din guzara hai aur kehte-kehte kab tak, sham ho jayegi?"
33,"Probably as I'm preparing dinner, if I prepare food dinner, or if I prepare fun food for my kids, but I don't eat it like chicken nuggets and french fries and stuff.",routine,107_33,P,id,,"Shayad jaise mein khana tyaar kar raha hoon, agar mein khana tyaar kar raha hoon ya agar mein apne bachhon ke liye mazaak ki tarah khana tyaar kar raha hoon, lekin mein usko nahi khata jaise chicken nuggets aur french fries aur us tarah ki cheezein."
34,"Let's say some Okay, say so by 7pm at that point in terms of the day being successful or less than successful, you know, okay, right at 7pm, you're aware. And at that point, if you have met your call, then you have a you have a TV show that you maybe it's recorded on a TV or something you would watch, okay? And if you were not as successful you would write. So I'd be like something to keep you motivated about the day because you really want to watch that show. Right? A lot of fun. Do you think that structure, that kind of behavioral strategy would give you enough motivation to have successful days so it's process?",routine,107_34,T,id,,"Chalo kahi to bol dijiye - bas 7 baje, us point par din successful hona ya less hoga tab jaise aur tumhe pata hoga. Agar aapne apna target poora kiya ho, toh uske baad tum koi TV show dekh sakte ho, jisme maybe aapne wo pehle record kar li hogi ya kuchh bhi. Agar successful nahi hua toh likhna padhega. To main sochna chahti thi, ki agar aisaa structure ya behavioral strategy daale toh kya wo tumhe din successful banane ke liye enough motivation provide karega? So is it a process?"
35,"I don't know honestly, but it would probably be the way right now",routine,107_35,P,id,-2.0,"Mujhe honestly nahin pata, lekin ab waqt par sahi tarike se hi ho ga shayad."
36,"And this is something you could also track. Right? You could write down days that are successful days or lessons less than successful. And we could look at if there's any patterns, maybe weekends are harder, because they're easier or something where we can identify days that have maybe more triggers or we're less motivated.",routine,107_36,T,id,,"Aur yeh kuchh aisa hai jo aap track kar sakte ho na? Aap successful din ya fir kam successful sikhne wale lessons ko likh sakte ho. Aur hum dekh sakte hain ki koi pattern hai, shayad weekend mushkil ho ya fir kch aisa jahan hum dekh sakte hain ki konsi din hain jinme jyada triggers ya fir hum motivate nahi hain."
37,"Yeah, I didn't think about that. Because right every day would be different.",routine,107_37,P,id,,"Achha, mujhe uske baare mein nahi socha tha. Kyonki sahi hai ki har din alag hoga."
38,"Okay, there's the potential for every day to be different with what you're exposed to, and what temptations in terms of different foods, what your schedules like maybe for busier things easier. So we can We can look at those different patterns. And we can add levels to this plan. Okay, but for now we'll go with the TV show that you'll watch sometime after seven, seven, you evaluate how you did, sometime after that. watch the show, okay? That's like a plan. ",routine,107_38,T,id,,"Theek hai, har din aapko alag kuch expose hone ke potential hai, aur different khana ki temptations, aur aapka schedule jaise busier woh sab inspect kar sakte hain. Hum iss plan ko levels add kar sakte hain, lekin abhi hum tv show ki plan par over karege, jisko aap 7 ke baad dekho, aur evaluate karege kaise aapne fare kiya, uske baad show dekho, tha plan jaisa."
39,"So that's leading up to the five pounds. Right? Right. Okay,",routine,107_39,P,crq,,Le jaa raha hai saath five pounds. Sahi hai? Right. Theek hai.
40,"day by day, okay, this and five pound increments, okay, four times to get to your goal. 20 pounds. Okay. Sounds good. So far. So, we'll give that a shot. And we'll take a look at the pattern that emerges, support everything. I say, write everything down. Okay, probably at around seven is a good time. When you know kind of day ahead, write down kind of what happened that day and whether you've had success or not. And bring that in. I'll see you again week. So give us I'll give you seven, seven days to work with. Okay? And we'll look at that log of events. And we'll reevaluate each week.",story,107_40,T,cd,,"Din din, theek hai, yeh aur paanch pound ki baakiya, theek hai, chaar baar tak apni manzil tak pahunchne ke liye. 20 pound. Theek hai. Acha laga. Abhi tak. Theek hai, hum yeh koshish karenge. Aur hum dekhte hain ki usme kya pattern banata hai, sab kuch support karke. Main keh raha hoon, sab kuch likho. Theek hai, thoda sa saat ke baje ho sakta hai acha time. Jab aap jaan len din ke baad ki baaten, likh de usme kya success mil raha hai ya nahin. Aur usko le aao. Main phir chaar hafton mein aapko dekhunga. Theek hai, hum aapko saat din denge koshish karne ke liye. Theek hai? Aur hum usme events ki yeh log dekhenge. Aur har hafte wapas dun aazmaenge."
