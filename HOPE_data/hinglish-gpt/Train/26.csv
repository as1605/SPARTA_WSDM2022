And so I want to talk with you about that and just talk with you about kind of treatment and how things are going to go.

Toh yeh ek cheez hai jis ke baare mein main aapse baat karna chahta hoon, mujhe pata hai ki aapne kuchh dinon mein kuchh moolyon ka aakalan kiya hai. Isliye main aapse iske baare mein baat karna chahta hoon aur aap se ilaj aur chizen kis tarah se hongi uske baare mein baat karna chahta hoon. Aur isse lagta hai ki jo aapne aakalan prakriya mein kaha tha, uske aadhar par aapko khaane ka vyadhi hai, jise bulimia nervosa kehte hain, aur main yeh bhi nahi jaanta ki kya aapne kabhi iske baare mein suna hai."

4,"So what I want to do is kind of describe that for you a little bit. So what you talked about was that there are periods of time when you have when you have eating episodes where you eat, like kind of a large amount of food that you feel like that you've lost control and you feel, you know, like overly full me vomit and the This happens fairly regularly. And there are times to when you, you know, you're maybe really overly concerned about your shape or your weight. And that feel familiar to you. Yeah. So and then it sounds like that's been going on for quite some time, at least, you know, two, three, sometimes even upwards of five times a week.",story,26_4,T,irq,,"Toh main jo karna chahta hoon voh thoda sa tumhe batana hai. Toh jo tumne baat ki thi voh yeh hai ki kabhi kabhi aapke paas aise samay hote hain jab aap kuch khaane ki episodes hote hain jahan aap khaana khate hain, aise thodi si zyaada matra mein, aur aapko lagta hai ki aapne control kho diya hai aur aap apni khaali bhi lagti hain, aur yeh kaafi niyamit roop se hota hai. Aur kabhi kabhi aapko apni shakal ya apne wajan se bohot zyaada pooch-ta-cheet hoti hai. Aur yeh tumhe jaan pata hai. Haan. Aur phir lagta hai ki yeh kaafi lambe samay se ho raha hai, kam se kam do-tin, kabhi-kabhi tees-saal se bhi zyaada baar ek hafte mein."
5,"I, I'd say, Yeah. All right.",inactive,26_5,P,id,,"Mai, mai bolu to, Haan. Theek hai."
6,"So just want to let you know to about, about that, that it's not unusual. For a person like in college like yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder like this. In fact, we see upwards of 5% of women and call on college campuses who struggle with that and even more upwards of 20%, who have you know, kind of what we would call kind of variants of that in terms of excessive dieting, and some may even like, throw up or use laxatives or excessively exercise, so it's not unusual. One of the things we know about blaming Nervosa is that for a lot of women, it really starts by Excessive dieting. So like going for long periods of time without eating and sounds like that that was something that you endorsed as well that there are times when you kind of diet excessively. Yeah,",routine,26_6,T,irq,,"So just want to let you know to about, about that, that it's not strange. For a person like in college like yourself to be struggling with an eating disorder like this.

especially jab main chota tha."
8,"One of the things that we know about bulimia nervosa is that when people overly restrict or you know, stop eating a lot or go for, you know, a day and a half and really restrict their calories, that oftentimes that that kind of leads into that kind of binge eating cycle. And we know that that's the case. The other thing that we're aware of is that a lot of individuals who struggle with eating difficulties like this also report a lot of difficulties they have like with managing stress or managing relationships or have a difficult time knowing what they're feeling or managing feelings. Is that something that you've experienced? Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, that's okay. Because in many respects, I think both things go on for individuals that struggle with eating difficulties like that. And so we know that there's a lot of dieting and restriction that goes on but we also know that there are other things that are happening in terms of managing feelings, managing stress, etc. So one of the things that I like to focus on in terms of working with clients and working with individuals like yourself is I take an approach it's called interpersonal psychotherapy and, and what that means, in essence is that I like to approach the eating problem by looking at kind of the kind of social in kind of more interpersonal context, because there's a lot of things that are probably going on, or may have gone on in your life that have been kind of associated with times and you've been more likely to use food or to restrict your calorie intake. And so what I'd like to do is really talk with you over the next, you know, few sessions about, you know, periods of time in your life currently and in the past where you've had, you know, overeating episodes and when you've restricted your calories, when you've You know, lost weight, or when you, you know binge and things like that and really start looking at, you know, patterns perhaps in your relationships and then what we'll do is kind of sum that up at the end of the time that we're together and see if we can kind of come up with a little bit of a game plan and some goals to help you reduce your binge eating. So how's that sound? Okay. And there's really good evidence for the things you know, the things that we're going to be doing, in fact, the more that we work on some of these issues, you'll you'll know pretty quickly that you're gonna start feeling a lot better and, and it'll have a, you know, pretty positive impact on your eating. Okay, great. So this is what I'd like to do is first of all, first of all, let's start with I want you to give me a recent episode, where like just recently within the last couple days where you've had one of those episodes that you talked about where you felt like a lot that you lost control, and that you ended up vomiting or you know, and and it will and kind of get an idea about that. And then what I'd like to do is and we'll go kind of back in time, and then I want you to tell me the first time that you had an episode like that. So and then then what we'll do then over the next couple of sessions is then we'll, we'll start from when it started and kind of like work our way up to the present. And I'll just ask you a lot of questions and we'll, you know, kind of go from there. Right? So why don't you tell me the Tell me like a recent episode, that where you felt like that you'd lost control.

67,"I mean, I wasn't excited about it. It was kind of like a more uppity area. Yeah, I mean, like, it was kind of hard, because they're like, like in a private school, these people have kind of been together for a little while. And because there's less people there, they kind of moreso all know each other and have their groups and whatnot.",story,26_67,P,id,,"Maine matlab, mujhe iske baare mein utna zyada khushi nahi thi. Thoda sa ek jyada anshankit upbhoktaon ka kshetra tha. Haan, main iska matlab hai, keval itna ki yeh thoda mushkil tha, kyunki voh, private school jaise, log thode time se ek saath hain. Aur kyunki vahaan kam log hain, to un sabhi ko ek dusre se zyada jaante hain, aur apne apne groups hain. Aur sab kuch."
68,"Okay. And so then that would have been in around the time when you were 1213 when you made that move. Okay, so then, sounds like to that that was the time when you first were aware of struggling with your eating.",symp/reasoning,26_68,T,irq,,"Okay. Aur fir uss wakt jab aap 1213 saal ke the tab aapne uss faisal ko kiya tha. Okay, toh phir uss wakt pehli baar aapko apne khaane ke saath joojhne ka ehsaas hua tha."

She was very vocal. towards me about my eating and my looks and whatnot.",symp/reasoning,26_69,P,id,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai maine shuru kiya hai. Yaar, aur mujhe apni maa se zyada dabao mehsus hua. Unhone mujhe mere khane peene aur mere appearance ke baare mein baar baar bolte the."
70,"Oh, that you felt when you say pressure from her In what way? Were she pressuring you?",routine,26_70,T,irq,,Ye wo feeling thi jab tum kehte the ki usse pressure feel kar rahe ho. Kaise? Kya wo tumko pressure de rahi thi?
71,"I mean, like she wanted me to look good.",routine,26_71,P,id,,"Maine kaha tha, jaise ki ushe mujhe accha dikhnxa tha."

73,hair. Yeah. Okay.,inactive,26_73,P,ack,,Baal. Haan. Thik hai.
74,"And it sounds like what you were saying was that we'll ask you how you felt. And you said you You said you weren't excited. You weren't excited. Like I wasn't excited, but so doesn't mean so did that mean that you weren't sounds like if you weren't happy?",routine,26_74,T,crq,,Aur yeh dikh raha tha ki tum keh rahe the ki hum tumse poochenge ki tum kaisa mehsoos kar rahe the. Aur tumne kaha ki Tumne kaha ki tum utsaahit nahi the. Tum utsaahit nahi the. Main bhi utsaahit nahi tha lekin kya yeh yeh matlab tha ki agar tum khush nahi the?
75,happy let them know that I didn't like the school.,routine,26_75,P,cd,,"Khush ho, maine unhe school pasand nahi tha bataya."
76,Okay. And then what when you would do that what would be the risk,routine,26_76,T,irq,,Thik hai. Aur phir jab tum yeh karoge toh usse kya khatra hoga?
77,"I just like, oh, you should feel lucky. Like it's good school. Okay.",routine,26_77,P,id,,"I just like, oh, tu toh lucky feel karna chahiye. Jaise ki yeh school accha hai. Okay."
78,"Okay. Well, so many ways, like, one might be putting words your mouth, but what like, kind of get over it or like deal with it or, okay. So and so then you were feeling pressure from her sounds like also to that you weren't really feeling like that they were really that maybe there wasn't as much concern about your feelings about where you were. Was there anything specifically that your mom would say to you about that in terms of like, kind of the Get over it? You know that?",routine,26_78,T,irq,,"Thik hai. Acha, bhot saare tarike hai, jaise, kisi ko moohn mein dard dekar jaana, lekin kya aap usse nipt paate hai ya fir usse deal karte hai ya, theek hai. Toh ye to hai hi, phir aage aapko uski taraf se pressure mehsoos hua ki aap sach mein vaise mehsoos nahi kar rahe the jaise usne aapki feelings ke baare mei concern kiya ho aur wo kahin na kahin aapke feelings ke baare mei kaafi kam sochti thi. Kya aapke maa dwara specifically is vishay ke baare mei kuch aur kehti thi jaise, usko nikaal do? Kya aapko pata nahi ki aapki feelings ke baare mei kya kehte the?"
79,"I mean, you mean in terms of the schooler? My body?",inactive,26_79,P,id,,"Mera matlab hai, kya aap schooler ke mayane mein kehrahe hain? Mera shareer?"
80,"No, you're in terms of the school.",routine,26_80,T,irq,,"No, tu school ke terms me ho."
81,"I mean, like get over it, like, it will get better with time. Like you just have to put yourself out there to meet people.",symp/reasoning,26_81,P,id,,"Mujhe matlab hai, jaise ki use peeche chhod do, jaise hi samay ke saath accha ho jayega. Jaise hi aapko apne aap ko logon se milne ke liye bahar jaana hoga."
82,"Okay. All right. So, that kind of pressure. Yeah. And then you said that you didn't really like Bruce, what kind of person was a man? What was making you not like him so well?",routine,26_82,T,irq,,"Theek hai. Achha. Toh, woh tarah ka dabav. Haan. Aur phir maine kaha ki tumhe Bruce pasand nahi tha, woh kaunsa insaan tha? Tumhe usse pasand nahi aaya kyonki?"
83,"I mean, he's just kind of like a sketchy guy. Okay.",routine,26_83,P,id,,"Arrey yaar, matlab woh bus ekdum sketchy aadmi jaise hai. Thik hai."
84,"Oh, so that maybe that there was something going on between Bruce and your mom prior to the divorce? Yeah. Sorry to hear that must have been really hard. Yeah. And were you keeping in touch with your dad during that time? Yeah. Okay. Like, were you? I mean, how what was the arrangement where you're spending time with him sometimes and spending time with your mom?",routine,26_84,T,irq,,"Oh, so that what that there was kuch chal raha tha Bruce aur teri mom ke beech mein divorce se pehle? Haan. Sunke afsos huwa, woh bahut mushkil hoga. Haan. Aur kya tu us waqt apne dad se contact mein tha? Haan. Thik hai. Par, tu tha kya? Matlab, kya jaise kabhi kabhi uske saath time bita raha tha aur kabhi apni mom ke saath?"
85,Yeah. So I said my mom during the week and I got to my dad like every other week. Okay.,routine,26_85,P,id,,Haan. Toh maine week me apni mom se baat ki aur har doosre week apne dad se mila. Theek hai.
86,"Okay. So then, given the fact that in case you weren't happy in school, you said that it was more kind of an uppity school, private school. Kids Was it a mixed school or was it like an all girls school? Yeah, mix school and that kind of clicky sounds like and then your mom really sounds like she really was pressuring you really wanted to try to pressure you so that you fit in a little bit better. So when in this process Did you find yourself like like turning to food or being excessively concerned about your weight or starting to diet binge things like",story,26_86,T,irq,,"Okay. So then, given the fact that in case tu nahin khush the school mein, tu ne bola ki yeh zyada uppity type ki school thi, private school. Bacche Woh ek mix school tha ya phir ek girls school jaisa? Haan, mix school tha aur woh thoda clicky type ka lagta tha, aur teri mom ko bahut laga ki tu thoda zyada fit ho jaa, isliye woh tujhe zyada pressure de rahi thi. Toh iss process mein tune khud ke aap ko khane ki taraf mod diya ya tumhari weight ki chinta bahut zyada ho gayi ya shuru kar diya diet ya binge karne ki cheezein."
87,"dieting, it's definitely I guess, like eighth grade, ninth grade. And that definitely came from like, my mom thinking were telling me that to look a certain way to knit Yeah, and then there were times like, like there was unhealthy food around the hospital debris seats. Mm hmm. And is there an accessible at times like I would eat that I would say for the most part, I would try to like really restrict myself to Okay.",story,26_87,P,id,,"Dieting, yeh zaroor hai, meri guessing hai, jaise ki eighth grade, ninth grade mein. Aur yeh zaroor meri mom se aaya tha, woh mujhe bataya karti thi ki kuchh alag tarah se dikho aur knit banao. Haan, aur kabhi kabhi aisa hota tha ki hospital mein gandagi ke karan unhealthy khaney aate the. Mm hmm. Aur kabhi kabar main unhey kha leta tha lekin zyadatar main khud ko rokne ki koshish karta tha. Thik hai."
88,Okay. And do you recall the first time that you then vomited or use vomiting as a way to kind of like manage the overeating?,symp/reasoning,26_88,T,irq,,Theek hai. Aur kya aap yaad karte hai vo pehli baar jab aap ne puke kiya tha ya fir sukhake khane se niptane ke liye use karte the?
89,"I mean, just like pressures of starting High School, and I'm in a same school, same people and I really wasn't happy, hard to make friends. I don't know When I guess I heard from some of the other girls about, like vomiting as like an option, right, that they've heard some of their friends talk about before. Right? Right. Yeah, so, okay. And like the dieting even though if I was eating healthy, I would still hear from my mom like, oh, like you need to look like this, right? Here's this outfit I want you to wear, but you can't wear it like if your body's like that.",story,26_89,P,id,,"Mera matlab hai, bas high school ki shuruwat ki dabaav jaise, aur main ek hi school mein hu, wahi log aur main sach mein khush nahi tha, dost banana mushkil ho gaya tha. Main nahi jaanti jab maine anumaan lagaaya fir maine doosri ladkiyon se suna ki, jaise ulti ho jaana ek vikalp hai, sahi hai, ki unhone apne dosto se pehle is baare mein baat kari hai. Sahi hai na? Sahi hai. Haan, to theek hai. Aur jaise dieting, chahe agar main sehatmand khaana kha rahi thi, to bhi meri maa se sunna padta tha ki, oh, tu aisa hi dhikhegi, sahi hai? Yeh outfit main tere liye pehnana chahti hu, lekin tu aisa pehen nahi sakti agar tera shareer aisa nahi hai."
90,"So she was really critical of how you looked. Okay, okay, so then what was that? What did that do? Let me take a step back. So it sounds like that. You've always been a little closer to your dad. So then what was the divorce and the move and some of that transition? What effect did that have on your relationship with your mom?",routine,26_90,T,crq,,"Yeh, toh woh bohot critical hui thi teri appearance par. Theek hai, theek hai, toh phir kya hua tha? Yeh kya kar diya tha? Chal mujhe do kadam peeche jana hai. Toh yeh kuch aise lag raha hai. Tu hamesha se apne papa ke paas thoda zyada rehta tha. Toh phir woh divorce aur move aur kuch uss transition par kya asar hua? Teri Mom ke saath teri rishtey par?"
91,"I mean, I don't even really remember like a really good time with my mom.",routine,26_91,P,cd,,"Arre, mujhe toh yaad nahi hai ki koi bhi khoobsurat pal tha jaisee ki mere saath mere maa ke saath."
92,Okay. Okay. All right. So the two of you don't get along as well. Okay. Did it was it getting? Was it kind of the same during that time? Or was it getting worse?,routine,26_92,T,irq,,Theek. Theek. Theek hai. Toh dono aap logon ka sath thik nahi hai. Theek hai. Kya ye ghat raha tha? Kya ye wahi dauran bhaut badh raha tha? Ya fir ye aur zyada ghat raha tha?
93,"I mean, I guess I was getting more vocal towards her and speaking my mind more.",routine,26_93,P,id,,"Mera matlab yeh tha, main uske saath zyada bolne laga aur apne dil ki baat zyada kehne laga."
94,"Okay. All right. And then she was then coming back more harshly and more critically. Okay. All right. Okay. Well, it's not unusual. I mean, a couple things, certainly not unusual for, you know, girls at that age, you know, in terms of like, kind of the social influence or kind of the social contagion of, you know, with eating and diet, you know, binge eating and dieting and vomiting. So it sounds like that, that was kind of, in some respects part of that culture. But it also sounds like that there, you know, in terms of the external pressure that you were getting from your mom to look a particular way. It almost sounded like that, that she was saying that you were like, What? You were too heavy for a particular outfit. And so then, I'm sure that that Do you remember how that was feeling to you at that time when she would say things like that?",story,26_94,T,irq,,"Okay. Theek hai. Fir woh wapas aa rahi thi, zyada sakht aur zyada nistar tha. Theek hai. Theek hai. Achha. Yeh aam baat nahi hai. Mera matlab hai, kuch cheezein, bilkul aam nahi hain, you know, ladkiyan us umar mein, social prabhav ya khaane ki bimari ke saath, dieting aur vomiting ke saath, bilkul aam hain. It seems like woh khuch is tarah ka ek culture ka hissa tha. Lekin lagta hai ki aapko bhi bahar se dabaav mil raha tha, aapki maa se, jo aapko ek specific tarah se dikhna chahti thi. Almost laga tha ki woh keh rahi thi ki aapke liye aap puri tarah se zyada bhari ho. Aur phir, kya aapko yaad hai ki aap us samay mein kaise mahsoos kar rahe the jab woh aapke baare mein aise cheezein kehte thi?"
95,"Today? Yeah, I felt like nothing I could do. Right. Right. Yeah.",routine,26_95,P,id,,"Aaj? Haan, mujhe aisa laga ki main kuchh bhi nahi kar sakti thi. Sahi. Sahi. Haan."
96,All right cut of Trump. Did you talk to anybody about that? Did you talk with your dad about that? Or?,routine,26_96,T,irq,,"Theek hai, Trump ko cut kardena. Kya tumne uske baare mein kisi se baat ki? Kya tumne apne dad se uske baare mein baat ki? Ya fir?"
97,"It's like, No, not really. Okay. We have.",routine,26_97,P,id,,"Yeh hai, Nahi, bilkul nahi. Theek hai. Humare paas hai."
98,"Okay. So you kept a lot of those feelings to yourself. Okay. All right. Okay, well, that's that's, that's helpful. Let's kind of let's kind of hang on to that, because we've got a couple things because obviously, I think the the divorce the move the transition from middle school to high school. Also sounds though that also during that time that you're obviously you didn't have a very good relationship with Bruce to begin with. And that your relationship with your mom was kind of deteriorating. Yeah. And then I know you said your grandmother passed away when you were in, in high school, but during that time, like, you know, eighth or ninth grade, did you have more contact with her? Were you able to, like",story,26_98,T,irq,,"Theek hai, toh tu ne bahut saare woh feelings apne apne andar rakhe. Theek hai. Acha. Achcha, yeh toh achchi baat hai. Thik hai, usse yaha par rok lete hain kyunki kuch cheezein hain na, divorce hai, move hai, middle school se high school, toh obviously, meri nazar mein toh, divorce, move, yaani middle school se high school, sab kuch ek saath. Lagta hai aapke sir Bruce se koi badi achchi relationship nahi thi shuru se hi. Aur phir aapki mom ke saath bhi kuch gadbad thi. Haan. Phir mujhe pata hai tumhe kaafi dukh hua jab tum high school mein the aur tumhari daadi guzar gayi. Lekin uss waqt, jaise tum eighth ya ninth grade mein the, tumhari daadi se zyada contact mila tha? Kya tum uske saath zyada milne ke liye ya haal mein jaane ke liye?"

Like when I would see my dad like occasionally we got,",routine,26_99,P,id,,"Usse uski saath jitni jyada ho sake jodo na? Woh bhi matlab, woh wahan ghoomti nahi thi, toh bas wahi thi main rehta tha.

But as well as training so as an only child and then your mom gets remarried and soon after a new baby And others also like, my mom and stepdad, like they both worked a lot.
