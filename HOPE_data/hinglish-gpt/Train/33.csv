0,"All right, let's How are you? ",inactive,33_0,T,gt,,"Thik hai, chalo batao, tum kaise ho?"
1,"Good, good. ",inactive,33_1,P,gt,,"Achha, achha."
2,It's good to see you. Yeah.,inactive,33_2,T,gt,,आपको देखकर अच्छा लगा. हाँ।
3,"Yeah, I mean, good week with the roommates. I had a good conversation with her about like, what times are good for boyfriend to be over and kind of giving him better heads up on when I'm really mean.",routine,33_3,P,gc,,"Haan, main toh, roommates ke saath achchi hafte guzari. Mujhe unse boyfriend ke aane ke acche samay aur jab main sach mei gusse waali hoon usko behtar dhyaan dena ke baare mein baat ki thi."
4,"Silence. Terrific. So what was what specifically? I mean, I know we've talked a lot about that, but what specifically did you say to her, or how did you bring it up",routine,33_4,T,irq,,"Chup. Bahut bhadiya. To phir kya tha kya? Matlab, mujhe pata hai humne bahut kuch uske baare mein baatein ki hai, but specifically tumne usko kya bola, ya kaise use discuss kiya?"
5,"is just telling her that like, my studies are really important and I understand like, it's also important that she time with her boyfriend, but that I would really appreciate that this is both our space and that there are times when like, we really need to respect each other's space. And yeah, she responded really well. Yeah, she was like, just really give me a good heads up before. Terrific. You. Yeah. And that we kind of decided like certain times are more appropriate for them to have the living room and not",story,33_5,P,id,,"Mujhe bas bata raha hai ki jaise, meri padhai bahut important hai aur main samajhta hu ki uske boyfriend ke saath time bitana bhi important hai, par mujhe bahut acha lagega agar yeh dono hamara space ho aur kabhi kabhi hume ek dusre ke space ka respect karna bhi zaroori hota hai. Aur haan, usne bahut acha react kiya. Haan, woh kah rahi thi ki bas mujhe pehle se hi acche se bata dena. Bahut accha. Tum. Haan. Aur humne decide kiya hai ki kuch time pehle wale unke liye living room appropriate honge aur humare liye nahi."
6,"right. Right. Right. Because I think that's really similar No, we kind of talked about that. Because I remember like a few sessions ago, I was kind of wondering whether or not she really got it in terms of what you were feeling because it seems like one of the ways that you've we talked about that before in terms of like, you know, first starting that oftentimes one of the ways that you manage your feelings that you kind of you think you're letting people know what you're you know, feeling but it doesn't really come out. And I know that it's something that you and I had to really like you know, kind of work out but sounds like that. You were able to talk with her in that She heard you. And as I want, as I kind of thought that she was actually really responsive in a very positive way.",story,33_6,T,irq,,"हां ना। क्योंकि मुझे लगता है कि वह बहुत ही समान है। होना ही चाहिए, हमने उसके बारे में बात की थी। क्योंकि मैं कुछ सत्र पहले यह सोच रही थी कि वह आपकी भावनाओं को क्या समझ रही है क्योंकि अक्सर एक तरीके से वह आपकी भावनाओं को कंट्रोल करती है, आप सोचते हैं कि आप लोगों को क्या समझा रहे हैं और वह बाहर नहीं आता। और मुझे पता है कि यह वह बात है जिस पर हमने साथ काम करने की जरूरत थी लेकिन मुझे लगता है कि वह आपके साथ बात करने में सफल रही है। और मैं तो हमेशा सोचती थी कि वह आप खासकर पॉजिटिव तरीके से सुस्त रहती थी।"
7,So I think being a little way direct was helpful.,routine,33_7,P,id,,So main soch raha hoon ki thoda seedha bolna madadgar tha.
8,"It's really nice, I think to you've been able to do that more with me, and I feel like that, that I feel like it's been really helpful. I know, they've been kind of pushing you on that. And that's been hard, but I feel like it's been really nice to feel like it's really been helpful with your relationship with Kathy. So that's fantastic. And also, you know, again, I know that I've keep, you know, like saying this over and over again. But you know, as you've worked on these things, it's been really notable that it's really had a nice positive effect on your eating because it seems like it's really you've really seen a lot of real nice improvements. So awesome. Anything else that you know, so you had a really good conversation with Kathy, anything else go on this week? Yeah, I got to spend some time with Brooke.",story,33_8,T,irq,,"यह बहुत अच्छा है, मुझे लगता है कि तुम अब ज्यादा कर पाए। मुझे ऐसा लगता है कि इससे मेरे संबंधों पर बहुत मदद हुई है। यह मुश्किल था, लेकिन मुझे लगता है कि इससे अपने साथी के साथ अच्छा संबंध हुआ है। बहुत बढ़िया। और एक बात, जिसे मैं बार-बार कहते हुए हाथ भी नहीं हटता हूँ। लेकिन जैसे-जैसे तुमने इन बातों पर काम किया है, तुमने खाने पर भी बहुत प्रभाव डाला है। यह तुमने असंभव बातों पर भी बहुत अच्छा प्रभाव डाला है। अद्भुत। कुछ और टिप्पणियां हो तो बताओ, क्या इस सप्ताह तुम्हारे साथ कुछ और हुआ? हां, मैं ब्रूक के साथ कुछ समय व्यतीत करने को मिला।"
9,"At home for two days, and it was with my mom and Okay,",routine,33_9,P,id,,"Home mein do dinon tak, aur mere saath meri maa thi aur tik hai."
10,okay. So she's still sixers. Did she have a birthday recently?,routine,33_10,T,irq,,Okay. Toh wo abhi bhi sixers hai. Kya use haal hi mein birthday hua tha?
11,He's awesome.,routine,33_11,P,id,,Woh awesome lag raha hai yaa
12,"Oh, that's great. almost seven great. You plans for birthday for her or what are you",routine,33_12,T,irq,,"Oh, wah bahut achha hai. Lagbhag saat achhe. Tumhare uske janamdin ke liye plan hai ya kya hai tumhare?"
13,She really into frozen?,routine,33_13,P,id,,Kya woh sach mein frozen mein hai?
14,"Okay? Like anything frozen. Okay, okay, okay. Yes. Okay, that sounds terrific. And so then you spend some time with her. So obviously that was real positive for you. Did you? When you were there? Did you have any opportunity to, you know, visit with your mom? or How did that go? I",routine,33_14,T,irq,,"Theek? Kuch bhi freeze ho gaya. Okay, okay, okay. Haan. Okay, woh toh bahut accha lag raha hai. Aur phir tum uske saath kuch waqt bitati ho. Toh obviously woh bahut positive tha tumhare liye. Kya tum uske saath the? Jahaan tum the? Kya tumhe kisi mauke mila tha, tere mom ke saath milne ka? Ya phir kaise gaya tha woh?"
15,"I think my mom was around like we kind of all spent time together. And like she asked about school. They were like, tell her a little more about school and how things are going. Yeah, we don't really get a one on one time.",routine,33_15,P,id,,"Mere ko yeh lagta hai ki meri maa hamare bich thi, hum sab sath samay bitate the. Aur unhone school ke bare mein pucha. Woh batane ko kaha ki school ke baare mein aur kya haal chal hai. Haan, humein ek dusre ke saath waqt nahi mil pata hai."
16,"How does it feel for you in terms of like for her? I know you've talked about not really liking that. She all the sudden, is deciding now that she wants to really be kind of like, you know, the good mother and kind of like be involved in your life. But how is it for her to kind of like want to want to know how things have been going for you. I mean,",story,33_16,T,irq,,"Tumhare liye kaisa lag raha hai uske liye? Main jaanti hoon ke tumne badi pasand nahi kiya uss baat ko. Vo hamesha hi, abhi hamesha sochti hai ke vo tumhare jeevan mein sachmuch ek achchi maa ban kar shamil ho jaaye. Lekin uske liye kaisa lag raha hai ke vo jaanna chahti hai ke tumhare saath kaise halaat chal rahe hain. Main mera matlab,"
17,"I've kind of like allowed myself to tell her I guess I don't think have been going. I mean, like, to an extent, like it was like it broke and whatnot like we don't really sit down just do together.",story,33_17,P,id,,"I've kind of allowed myself to tell her, I guess. I don't think I've been going, like, I mean, to some extent, it was like it broke and whatnot, like we don't really sit down and do things together."
18,"So kind of what we had discussed kind of that you've been, you've like, you've been allowing yourself to be more connected with her, but you're still kind of keeping up keeping a little bit of a boundary. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm sure that would be really hard to trust her after everything that's gone on, you know, with, you know, kind of the infidelity issue with your dad, or at least it's just, you know, kind of like the wondering about that. I mean, I think you kind of know that that was probably what was going on, but then, you know, and then moving you how harsh and critical she was issues with Brooke, you know, even I still even remember to, for her to have gotten to the point where she wouldn't even let you like go to your grandmother's funeral or at least you know, kind of, so all those things have been so like, you know, front and center, you know, and so now I feel like that she's made this real dramatic shift and, you know, wanting to start being a mom, that sounds like that. You're really working to try to manage that in, you know, in a better way?",story,33_18,T,irq,,"Toh kya hamne discuss kiya tha wohi hua hai ki tum uske saath zyada jude hue ho, par tum abhi bhi thoda sa doori banaye rakhte ho. Haan. Toh main yeh samajh sakta hun ki tumhari liye us par bharosa karna bahut mushkil ho raha hai, tumhare papa ke saath woh roothna aur tumhare baare mein sochne ki wajah se. Main sochta hun ki tumhe pata hai ki woh kya chal raha tha, par phir bhi woh tumhe aur bharosa dilate hue bhi bahut sakht aur ninda karne wali thi Brooke ke saath, tumhari dadi ke antim sanskaar mein jaane nahin diya tha. Saare baatein toh bahut prominent the, aur ab woh ek dramatic badlaav ki hai aur maa banne ka jazba dikha rahi hai. Tum bahut koshish kar rahe ho ki uss badlav ko ache se sambhal lo, hai na?"
19,"Yeah. I mean, like we still butt heads a little bit. I'm sure Shane but",story,33_19,P,id,,Haan. Matlab jaise hum ab bhi thode se ladte hai. Main sure hoon Shane bhi but.
20,"yeah, yeah, but when you do butt heads, what is it how what happens in terms of your eating when you guys kind of like you feel like that there's a little bit of a friction.",story,33_20,T,irq,,"Haan, haan, lekin jab tum gussa ho jate ho tab tumhari khaane mein kya badlaav hote hain jab tum log ek dusre se takraate ho, toh tumhe aisa kyun lagta hai ki tum dono ke beech thoda sa jhagda ho gaya hai."
21,"I mean, I guess that's like, kind of leaps back to things like things are really good this weekend for the most part and then kind of when I was leaving she just like, either just brought up things about wanting to know more about life and whatnot and what's going on at school and if I'm seeing anyone, yeah, it's just like, we don't have that relationship.",story,33_21,P,id,,"Mainly like, I think that's like, kind of goes back to things like things are great this weekend for the most part and then while leaving she simply brought up things about wanting to know more about life and stuff and what's happening at school and if I have a significant other, yeah, it's just like, we don't have that kind of bond."
22,"Right. So that really, that's a really stressful time?",routine,33_22,T,irq,,"Thik hai. Toh kya sach mein, woh ek bahut stressful samay hai?"
23, like when I got back to school like right after that. And like caught me.,routine,33_23,P,id,,"Jaise hi main mohalle ki taraf laut rahe the waise hi, mujhe achanak se school jana pada. Aur waise hi, mujhe pakad liya."
24,"Well, it makes a lot of sense because again, you know, like, you know, we've really reviewed this quite a bit but You know, historically, that's how it's been, you know that that's really been a real enemy. It really clarifies why we're working on this because it's so clear that when the two of you have like these rough patches, that it really all of a sudden evokes all these like negative feelings. And that's when food like really, you know,",story,33_24,T,irq,,"Haye, yeh toh bohot logical lagta hai kyunki phir se, pata hai na, humne iska bohot saara review kardiya hai par tumko pata hai, itihaas mein bhi aisa hi hota aaya hai, pata hai na ki woh sach-muchi hamara dushman tha. Yeh saaf-saaf samjhata hai ki hum ispar kaam kar rahe hain kyunki jab tum dono ke beech mein aisi mushkil waqt aate hain, tab yeh saare negative emotions ekdum se aa jaate hain. Aur phir khana bhi uss waqt kaafi important ho jaata hai, pata hai na."
25,"you know, all comments, though. Yeah. What I'm wearing. Right. Right.",inactive,33_25,P,id,,"abe dekhteho, sab comments hoti hai, haan, mai kya pehnei hu. Theek. Theek."
26,"Right. Right. Yeah. So it's really hard to, you know, I can understand it's really hard to let that go. I mean, cuz obviously, there's a lot of lot of feelings that you have about that. Yeah. Yeah. But on the other hand, too, it seems like that, you know, things have been going really well. How have things been going in terms of just in general like school friendships, you know, anything else that's on the horizon? ",routine,33_26,T,irq,,"Haan. Haan. Haan. Toh yeh bahut mushkil hai, pata hai, uski jaane mein. Main samajh sakta hu ki tumhe uski jaane ke baare mein bahut se jazbaat hai. Haan. Haan. Lekin, dusri taraf, lagta hai ki, sab kuch bahut accha chal raha hai. Kaisa chal raha hai sab kuch, jaise ki school mein dostiyan aur kuch aur jo tere haath mein ho?"
27,"yeah, kind of scene guy.",routine,33_27,P,id,,"ये पक्का, थोड़ा सिन है"
28,I won't get too excited about that. But tell me about him telling you about him.,routine,33_28,T,crq,,Mujhe uski baare mein batao par mein uske baare mein zyada excited nahi hunga. Par tum mujhe uske baare mein batao jo tumhe uske baare mein bataya gaya tha.
29,"Yeah, he felt like my mother.",routine,33_29,P,cd,,"Haan, usse meri maa ki tarah lag raha tha."
30,Now what's this? You have to at least give me his name? What's his name?,routine,33_30,T,irq,,Ab ayiye ye kya hai? Aapko kam se kam uska naam to dena hoga? Uska naam kya hai?
31,His name's Alan.,routine,33_31,P,id,,Uska naam Alan hai.
32,"Alan. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, did you like, I'm not gonna blow this out of proportion. But how? How did that kind of come about?",routine,33_32,T,crq,,"अलन। ठीक है। अच्छा। ठीक है। मगर, क्या आपको पसंद आया, मैं यह बहुत बड़ा नहीं करूंगा। मगर कैसे? वह कैसे हुआ?"
33,"Yeah, cost together and kind of went and studied at a coffee shop. Yeah. And then just kind of asked to, like, do a movie night. And I was like, chill and good. Nice. Ya know, like,",routine,33_33,P,cd,,"Haan, hum sidhe ki aur ja kar coffee shop mein padhai ki. Haan. Fir bas humne movie night karne ke liye poocha. Aur main socha, masti karne mein achcha hoga. Accha hai. Pata hai, waise hi."
34,"Yeah. Nice. Nice. That's great. Oh, I'm really happy. That's great. So, a lot of really nice things that are going on. Yeah, that's terrific. Yeah. So then for you to go like from, you know, because, you know, we kind of got going with this thing. It was kind of like, you were full on binge eating, you know, virtually every day, sometimes twice a day, and now it'd be down to, you know, three, like in the space of like, you know, just like seven eight weeks is pretty remarkable. So no, I'm really pleased with how hard you've been working cuz you've really been pushing yourself. And I really appreciate it. I know this stuff with your mom is particularly hard. It's hard for you",story,33_34,T,orq,,"Arey, nice. Nice. Wah, itna khush hun. Wah, bohot saare mast baatein ho rahi hai. Arey, wah, maze ki baat hai. Arey, bohot hi zabardast hai. Sach mein, hum yeh chiz pe kaam shuru kiye the, toh tum toh full time khaana khaa rahi thi, practically har din, kabhi kabhi do baar, aur ab sirf teen, matlab bas saat-aath saptaah mein. Haan, bahut hi kamaal ki baat hai. Isliye, pehle se zyaada main tere efforts ko pasand kar rahi hun kyunki tune khud ko push kiya hai. Aur main sach mein iske liye shukriya ada karti hun. Pata hai, teri mom ki wajah se yeh sab bohot muskil hai. Tumhare liye bhi mushkil hai."
35,"is like not being able to, like I don't feel comfortable really telling her yet about.",routine,33_35,P,od,,"Isko bolne mein mujhe abhi woh aaraam nahi mil raha hai, jaisa ki usko bataana zaroori nahi samajhti."
36,"And you may not, you know, I mean it's like, you know, another we talked about there's like maybe there are times when you just don't really want to share some of that stuff. You know, and and I think sometimes my experience has been some parents, like, you know, the goal is not to make her feel bad. If you would want to share it, you'd want to share it knowing that she would hold on to that and keep it and really connect with you around it and want to be helpful rather than like, like, Oh, yeah, you were so mean to me now have an eating disorder, you know, because then that that feels, you know, that doesn't feel quite right. And know that that's, you know, I know that you have a lot of hard feelings, but I don't really feel like that. That's how you'd want that to go, you know? Yeah. And I know we've talked about it a lot, but how are things going with your dad? Yeah,",story,33_36,T,irq,,"Aur tum toh nahin kar sakte, tumhe pata hai, mann kiya ki jaise, tumhe pata hai, dusra jo hum baat kar rahe the main samajhti hoon ki kabhi kabhi tum sach mein kuchh baat nahin karna chahte. Tum jaante ho, aur mere anubhav ke anusar kuchh maa-baap aise hain, jaise ki tum jaante ho, lakshan hai ya tumhare saath chalna chahti hain, use badhaaiyaan dete hain. Par agar tum chahte ho ki use tumhare saath baantna chahiye toh tum jaante ho ki woh usi ko pakadke rakhna aur woh tumhare saath judegi aur tumhe sahayog karegi. Lekin yaar, jaise ki, arre ho gaye, tum mere saath bahut bura banaate ho aur phir tumhe khaane ka vyadhi ho jata hai. Yeh pata hai ki tumhare andar kafi kathin bhavnaayein hain lekin mujhe waisa nahin lagta ki tum chahoge ki voh aise ho. Yeh samajh lo? Haan. Aur hamne bahut baat ki hai lekin kaise chal raha hai tumhare papa ke saath? Haan."
37,"yeah. Yeah, he's doing well, hoping that he's coming up here to school to see me once he plays a couple weeks. Great.",routine,33_37,P,id,,"Haan, haan. Woh acche se kar raha hai, ummeed hai ki woh school ke liye yahaan aa raha hai, mujhe dekhne ke liye jab woh kuch hafto se khelne ke baad aaega. Badiya."
38,"So nice. They'll be really nice for you to spend time with them. That's great. That's really great. Yeah. So let's talk some more about this thing with your mom, because I feel like that. I mean, I know it's tough, but I guess I've been thinking about this a lot, especially after last session that that given the fact that, you know, you and Brooke are so close, and it does feel like that your mom is, at least she seems like she's making she's trying to make an attempt to connect with you. Whether or not, you know, at what point would you feel like that you? Well, what would you need from her in order to feel like that you could kind of like, maybe not let down the walls, but kind of soften those a little bit. I mean, is there something is there something that like, if you could ask They're like, okay, mom, if you did this, then I would do this. Not that you would do that. But just wondering if like, what would you? ideally what would you like to see in order to feel like that you could connect with her more.",story,33_38,T,irq,,"Arey bahut hi acche hain. Woh tumhare saath waqt bitane ke liye bahut hi acche honge. Wah toh bahut hi accha hai. Wah bahut hi accha hai. Wah. Chalo, chalo tumhari maa ke baare mein aur baat karte hain kyunki mujhe lagta hai ki... Mera matlab hai, pata hai ki mushkil hai, lekin maine is baare mein bahut socha hai, especially pichle session ke baad jab pata chala ki tum aur Brooke itne kareeb ho aur aisa lagta hai ki tumhare maa ne, kam se kam woh koshish kar rahi hai ki woh tumse jude. Chahe tumhe pata ho ya na ho, tum kis baat par aise mehsoos karoge jab tumhara believe ho ki tum? Kya tumhe uss se kuch zaroorat hai jiske bina tumhara vishwas ho ki tum thoda sakoon se uske saath judoge. Kya koi aisi cheez hai jiski tum maangi... Theek hai maa, agar tum yeh karogi toh main yeh karunga. Main jaanta hoon ki aisa nahi hoga, lekin bas soch raha tha ki kya? Ideal scenario mein tum kya dekhna pasand karoge taki tum uss se zyada jud sako."
39,"I mean, like, I wish she really recognized like, kind of the pressures that she put on me back in the day, huh? Yeah, and just like now to just know just kind of be there in the moment. So like, trying so hard to like, things still come out. Like she still makes her little comments that they.",symp/reasoning,33_39,P,id,,"Yaar, like, main toh chahati hu ki woh sach mein samjh jaye ki usne mujh par us samay wale dabaav ko kaisa dala, tu samjhi? Haan, aur ab bas yunhi wah waqt par mojood ho. Toh jaise, itna koshish kar ke bhi, humesha kuch na kuch thoos jaata hai. Jaise uski choti-choti baatein abhi bhi nikal jaati hai."
40,"Yeah, I know. We talked about this, but have you gotten to the point yet where you felt like that you could? Like, even let her know that. That that puts a lot of pressure on you or that that comment that she makes kind of hurt your feelings because I know that in the moment you feel it. But what would it be like for you if you were to just like, yeah, say like, you know, I know that you're I know that you mean Well, I mean, maybe she doesn't, but maybe it's sometimes important to approach it that way, but it really hurts my feelings or, you know, I feel like that that really puts a lot of pressure on me to look a particular way. And, you know,",story,33_40,T,irq,,"Haan, main jaanta hun. Hum is bare mein baat kiye, par kya tum is had tak pahunche jahan tumhe aisa lagta ho ki tum kar sakte ho? Jaise, use bata dena. Ye tumpe bahut bojh dalta hai ya fir wo baat jo wo bolti hai, usse mujhe bechain kar deti hai kyunki mujhe pata hai ke tum us soch mein ghira hota ho. Lekin agar tum ye bataoge ki haan, main toh jaanta hun ki tum chahte ho. Shayad wo aksar important ho, lekin shayad kuch baar aap chahte ho ki main aapko shaayad hurt karoon ya phir mere liye woh baat bahut zyada pressure create karti hai ki main kisi particular tarah dikhoon. Aur, tumhe pata hain..."
41,"so I mean, I am seeing that I like starting to see that she does mean well.",symp/reasoning,33_41,P,id,,"तो मैं मतलब है, मुझे देख रहा हूँ की मुझे देखना पसंद है की वह अच्छा मतलब रखती है।"
42,"right, because I know that you did that. You've done that with your roommate. I know there's been other times when people have done that. So I know that that's been kind of part of the bigger issue is just knowing what it is you're feeling and also being able to kind of give voice to that and you know, thinking about that relationship with your mom because it does seem like that every once in a while she kind of like jabs here, she'll send something out and and, and the way that you take it in is more like harsh, critical. You know her and, and I just don't know like color. It's kinda like with Kathy. When you Talk with her how it's like, it was like, it was like, Oh, of course, like, you know, uh, you know, I'll try to be more sensitive and I'm not really sure. You know whether or not your mom would be.",story,33_42,T,orq,,"Right, mai janta hu ki tune waha kiya kyuki mai janta hu ki tumne apne roommate ke saath bhi aisa kiya hai. Mujhe pata hai ki aur bhi mauke huye hai jab logo ne aisa kiya hai. Isliye mai jaanta hu ki yeh ek bada masla hai ke tum kya mehsus kar rahe ho aur usko vyakt karne ki kshamta bhi hai aur tumhara ma se rishta bhi soch raha hu kyuki kabhi-kabhi lagta hai ki vo tumhare upar tika lete hai, kuch bhej deti hai aur tum usko jyada kadak aur alochak tarike se le lete ho. Tum usko jaante ho aur mujhe bhi yahi maloom nahi hai ki uska rang kya hai. Lagta hai ki tum uss ke saath baat karte ho to, vaise hi jaise Kathy ke saath tha. Oh, zarur, tum jyada sensitive hone ki koshish karenge aur mujhe bilkul yaqeen nahi hai. Ki tumhare ma ko kya sujhav dena hai."
43,"Yeah, I mean, I guess she could do. Yes, I worry that, because we've always been kind of defensive towards each other. I just worry that like, that will happen again. I mean, I don't know, like it might not because of things happen. Right. But",story,33_43,P,od,,"Haan, main toh keh raha tha ki shayad woh kar payegi. Haan, mujhe chinta hai, kyunki hum hamesha se ek doosre ke saath defensive rahe hain. Mujhe bas yeh fikar hai ki yeh phir se ho sakta hai. Main yeh nahi jaanta, ho sakta hai ki aisa na ho kyunki cheezein hoti rehti hain. Theek hai. Lekin"
44,"yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I think there are times when I wonder if like, maybe if there's a time when you say something, like, I know there have been times when you kind of snap back at her, you know, or you'll kind of like, you know, barber or kind of jabber a little bit. What if, you know, again, you What have you thought about like, because it sounds like that you're really aware when you do that? Because you know that when she says something, you have a tendency to jet back. You could just say, you know, You know, I realized I was I, that was a that was a jab at you. And I'm really sorry, I aware that that sometimes I kind of get really critical with you and I that doesn't I don't feel very good about that. Now I wonder how she would you know if, if that would, what that would do, maybe, maybe it wouldn't do anything or may make you feel a little bit too vulnerable, but you think about it, I mean, and you kind of Mull that over in your mind about what that might be like, because my experience has been that sometimes. You know, I hate the phrase, be a bigger person, because then you know, I didn't want that to come across that way. But sometimes in order to change relationships, somebody has to be willing to kind of like, kind of be willing to do something just a little different. And since it seems like you have a growing awareness of, you know, the interactions that you have with her I wonder if that might be worthwhile. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. mulling over and think about it and, and we'll keep talking about it. But yeah, sounds like it was a really terrific week and been working really hard it really pays off because again, the more you've done that we've seen real positive impact on your eating so nice",story,33_44,T,gt,,"haan, haan. Haan. Waise, mujhe lagta hai ki kabhi-kabhi mai sochta hu, ki shayad agar koi baat kahi jaye, to kya pata, mai jante hu ki kabhi-kabhi tum usse jhijhakte ho, ya tum kuch kehte ho, ya phir tum apne baal ko thoda-sa hilate ho. Kya hota agar tum, phir se socho? Kyunki mujhe laga hai ki tum jab woh kuch kehti hai, to tumhare tendency hoti hai ki tum jaldi jawaab de do. Tum bas yeh keh sakte ho, pata hai, mai jaan gaya, uss waqt mai tumse ek jhijhak kiya tha. Aur mai sach mein maaf karta hu, ki kabhi-kabhi mai tumse bahut hi critical ho jata hu, aur mujhe woh accha nahi lagta. Ab mujhe yeh sochna hai ki woh kaise react karegi, kya pata, shayad kuch nahi ho ya phir tumhe thoda kamjori feel ho, par sochna hai. Aur tum apne dimaag me yeh baat gaur karlo, ki kya ho sakta hai, kyunki meri experience hai ki kabhi-kabhi, tumhe relationship ko badalne ke liye kuch naya karna hota hai. Aur mujhe pata hai ki ""bade insaan bano"" jaisi baat se mujhe waise feel hoga, par kuch alag karna zaruri hota hai. Aur kyunki tumhari interaction ke baare me ab tumhe zyada pata hai, to soch ke dekho, kya yeh zaruri ho sakta hai. Haan, haan. Haan. Soch ke dekhna aur hum baat karne ke sath-sath iske bare me discuss karte rahenge. Par haan, suna hai ki tumhara yeh hafte bahut accha gaya hai aur tum bahut mehnat kar rahe ho, aur yeh bahut achhe se kaam bhi kar raha hai. Kyunki jaise-jaise tum kar rahe ho, humne dekha hai ki tumhare khaane pe positive impact padta hai, to bahut accha hai."
