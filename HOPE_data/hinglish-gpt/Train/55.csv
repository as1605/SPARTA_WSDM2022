0,"So let's say you go into a house, you go to the community, okay? You go into a house and have an off day. Maybe worried about making mistakes, maybe stressed about that. Maybe tired. And there's some evidence there that you should be able to pick up but you just you don't write somebody lies to you about what the conditions there are You kind of realize that they might not be telling the truth, but you're you're ready to get home. So you leave and then somebody hurt when you have a worst case. That's the type of mistake you're afraid of making.  What would that feel like to make that mistake?",symp/reasoning,55_0,T,id,,"Toh chalo maan lete hai ki tum ek ghar mein jaate ho, ghar ke samudaay mein jaate ho, thik hai? Tum ek ghar ke andar jate ho aur tumhare liye ek off din hota hai. Shayed tum galatiyaan karne se pareshaan ho, ya fir tum uske baare mein stress mein ho. Shayed thak gaye ho. Aur wahaan koi saboot milta hai jo tumhe uthana chahiye, lekin tum likh nahi paate kyunki koi tumhe wahaan ke haalaat ke baare mein jhooth bolta hai. Tum samajhte ho ki woh sach nahi bol raha hai, lekin tum ghar jaane ke liye taiyar ho. Toh tum nikal jaate ho aur phir kisi ko chot lagti hai jab tumhare liye worst case hota hai. Yeh woh tarah ki galati hai jisse tum darte ho. Aise galati ko karne ka kaisa lagta hai?"
1,"Terrible, it would feel like, you know, I had a role in that kind of thing happening to somebody, like I was partially to blame for somebody being harmed. And that is like the exact opposite of what my job is supposed to be.",symp/reasoning,55_1,P,id,-1.0,"Yeh bohot bura hoga, jaise ki mujhe khud peh main kuch jimmedar hone ka ehsaas ho, kisi par aisa kuch hone mein, jaise main kisi ki haani hone mein se hissa hoon. Aur yeh bilkul mere kaam ke ulte hai joki hona chahiye."
2,"So that would be a worst case outcome. You would be extremely upset. You're extremely upset now. While you're five out of 10 right now, but you're an eight when you're in bed in the morning. Yeah. Is it reasonable that a professional makes a mistake like that? This is the mistake of kind of missing something that normally would be caught. Is it reasonable? They continue on in the field and try to learn from that.",story,55_2,T,id,,"'
Isse worst case scenario ho sakti hai. Aap bahut upset honge. Aap ab bahut upset hain. Aap abhi 10 mein se paanch hain, par jab aap subah bed mein hote hain, aap aath hote hain. Haan. Kya yeh samajhne waali baat hai ki ek professional aise galti kar sakta hai? Yeh woh galti hai jo normally notice ki jaati hai. Kya yeh reasonable hai? Ve field mein aagey badhte hain aur uss se seekhte hain."
3,"I don't know, I mean, I'd like to think that I guess it's not possible to make that kind of mistake, but I think that that's naive. I think it is possible. And I, I would like to learn from that, but I don't know what other people would do. Like I don't know if I would lose my job or anything.",story,55_3,P,id,-2.0,"Mujhe nahi pata, like, mujhe lagta hai ki main sochna chahta hu ki mujhe lagta hai ki wo tarah ki galti nahi ki ja sakti, par mujhe lagta hai ki ye bholapan hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki karna hai. Aur main, main usse sekhna chahta hu, lekin mujhe nahi pata ki dusre log kya karege. Jaase ki mujhe nahi pata ki kya mein apni job gawa dun ya kuch aur."
4,"Right, there might be consequences for that type of error. It's not intentional, something that like many mistakes would happen due to conflict confluence of circumstances who being tired of being the end of the day, not being honest. There's mitigation there. But still, I can appreciate you would want to make that mistake either way. What would your after making a mistake like that? What would your thought be? Would you be thinking?",routine,55_4,T,id,,"Theek hai, uss prakar ke ghate ki wajah se parinaam ho sakte hain. Yeh koi iraada nahin hai, kuch galtiyon ki wajah se ek saath ho jaane ki wajah se hota hai, jo ke dino ke ghumaye se thak gaye hone ki wajah se, sach kehne ki wajah se. Waha par samjhauta hai. Lekin phir bhi, main samajh sakta hoon ki aap chahte honge ki voh galti na ho jaye. Agar aap uss tarah ki galti karte hain toh aapko kya lagta hai? Aap kya sochenge? Kya aap soch rahe honge?"
5,"I would be thinking, I don't know how this will ever be better. I don't know how I'm ever gonna feel okay about what I did.",routine,55_5,P,crq,,Main soch raha hoga ki mujhe pata nahi yeh kabhi accha hoga. Main nahi jaanta ki main kabhi apne kiye ke baare mein theek mehsoos karunga.
6,"To my extension, I'll never feel okay about what I did. Yeah. And what do you think you would do then in terms of your reaction to that thought?",routine,55_6,T,cd,,"Mere angle se, main kabhi bhi apne kiye huye se theek nahi feel karungi. Haan. Aur tu kya sochta hai, agar aisa ho toh tere reaction kya hoga us vichaar ke liye?"
7,"I don't know. I mean, I guess ideally, I would say to myself, it's going to get better. You know, this will pass and everything but I don't know. It's just hard.",routine,55_7,P,gc,,"Main nahi jaanta. Matlab, main, sochta hoon ki ideally, main apne aap se kahunga, yeh behtar hoga. Pata hai, yeh guzar jaayega aur sab kuch theek ho jayega lekin main nahi jaanta. Yeh mushkil hai."
8,What do you think would do to your performance?,routine,55_8,T,irq,,"Tum apne performance par kya asar karegi, kya sochte ho?"
9,"I think I would probably Take some time off. I mean, it's just like I would be so stressed afterwards. And worried I would make another mistake because I'm so stressed out and having trouble focusing.",symp/reasoning,55_9,P,id,,I think main thodi si araam lena chaiye. Mujhe lagta hai ki main baad mein bahut stress hongi. Aur pareshan hokar mujhe aur ek galti hogi kyunki main bahut tense hokar aur dhyaan nahi de paungi.
10,"So in a strange way, the anxiety, the thoughts you're having now that result in anxiety, are leaving you more at risk to make a mistake.",symp/reasoning,55_10,T,id,,"Alex Hinglish: Toh kuchh ajeeb tareeke se, ye chinta, jo tumhare dimaag mein hai, jo chinta ka natija hai, voh tumhein kuchh galti karne ke liye zyada kharaab kar rahi hai."
11,"Yeah, I mean, I guess I never thought about it like that, although that makes a lot of sense. Like it. If I, if I just calm down and try to let it go, then I'll do my job better and I won't have that risk as much. But if I keep feeling like this, I'm not focusing and then I could make a bigger mistake because of it.",story,55_11,P,ack,1.0,"Haan, main toh socha hi nahi tha, par ab jaise bola tumne, woh bohot logical lagta hai. Pasand bhi hai mujhe. Agar main, agar main thoda shaant ho jaau aur yeh chiz chod du, toh main apna kaam behtar kar sakungi aur uss risk ko kam kar sakti hu. Lekin agar main iss tarah se mehsoos karte rahungi, toh mujhe focus nahi hoga aur phir main iss wajah se bada galti kar sakti hu."
12,"Right, so one of the thoughts you're having now is you can't make a mistake because it would be too devastating. And that titles like this. I have a thought you're having. So it's like you can't make a mistake. And this is leaving you emotionally less prepared and probably increased risk of making a mistake.",story,55_12,T,id,,"Right, toh ek baat jo ab tum soch rahe ho woh yeh hai ki tum koi galti nahi kar sakte kyunki woh bohot bura hoga. Aur ki jaise pehle bhi kuchh aisa hota tha. Mujhe soch aisa hi lagega ki tum ek galti nahi kar sakte. Aur yeh tere liye emotional taur pe kam tayyar hone ka matlab hai aur shayad galti karne ka zyada khatra bhi badh jata hai."
13,summary,"The patient is afraid that somebody lies of the situation and somebody is hurt in the worst case. The patient feels partially to be blamed and are extremely upset. After making a mistake, the patient doesn't know if they every gonna feel okay of what they did. It's hard. The patient feels stressed afterwards of making a mistake and wishes to take some time off. The therapist asserts the anxiety would leave the patient at more risk to make a mistake. ",,,,,
