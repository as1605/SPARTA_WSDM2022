Um, and then that didn't last very long. Forgive me, I have to remember like how long they were together because there's so many. But I believe that they were only together for not even a year. And then she kind of had some time where she just was dating But it was numerous people. And then she met somebody in her a meeting. And they married. That lasted, that they probably got married.",story,27_13,P,id,,"Areh, haan, mujhe maalum tha ki bahut jaldi unki talaaq ke baad hi woh kisi se shaadi kar li thi. Woh aadmi kitna acha tha mujhe pata bhi nahin tha, lekin lagbhag 6 mahine baad bahut tezi se sab kuch ho gaya. Aur phir bahut jaldi wah nahin reh paaye. Maaf kijiye, mujhe yaad karna hai ki unki saath aapas mein kitna waqt guzara hai kyunki bahut saare log the. Lekin mujhe lagta hai ki wo sirf ek saal hi reh paaye. Lekin uske baad bhi usne waqt guzara tha kuch logon ke saath dating karke. Phir usne apne ek meeting mein kisi ko dhundha aur woh ke saath shaadi kar li. Lekin lete gaya kitna wo saath rahe honge."

24,"All right, how about your relationship with your mother?",routine,27_24,T,irq,,"Theek hai, tere maa ke saath tera rishta kaisa hai?"
25,"Um, it's just it's honestly there's no other way to describe it. It's just chaotic. I mean, she's chaotic. So she's all over the place and it's just Hard to capture on a good day. And when you do, it's just you know, it's kind of surface our relationship.",symp/reasoning,27_25,P,id,,"Arey yaar, dekho yeh hai hi hai, koi aur tareeka nahi hai isse bayan karne ka. Yeh bas pure hulchul hai. Main keh raha hu, woh khud hulchul hai. Toh woh yahan wahan ghumti rehti hai aur samajhna mushkil hai acha din me. Aur jab pakad lete hai, toh pata chalta hai, yeh toh sirf humare rishte ka upar ka samne hai."
26,"Alright, so who? Who raised you?",routine,27_26,T,irq,,"Aacha, toh kaun? Kaun tumko bada kiya?"
27,"My parents raised me? Yeah, yeah. I mean, they were good parents, I guess, according to my standards, because my mom was just always a mess. So I guess they both did the best that they could, given some circumstances. So",story,27_27,P,id,,"Mere maa baap ne mujhe bada kiya? Haan, haan. Maine mtlb, wo acche maa baap the, mere khayal se, kyuki meri maa hamesha bechaani si rehti thi. To mai sochta hu ki dono ne apne paristhiti ke tohty khariyati ki. To."
28,"do you think the way they're raised has an impact on who you are now in terms of,",routine,27_28,T,irq,,"क्या तुमसे लगता है कि उन्हें पालना तुम्हारे इर्द गिर्द का असर करता है, अभी आपकै संदर्भ में?"

35,"Um, it's okay. You know, I guess. I mean,",routine,27_35,P,cd,,"Arre, theek hai yaar. Pata hai, samajh raha hoon. Mera matlab hai, I mean,"
36,I didn't mention that. Everybody went their separate way.,routine,27_36,T,irq,,Maine ye nahi kaha tha. Sab alag-alag tareeke se chale gaye.
37,"Yeah. I don't really see them quite honestly. So If I do see them and maybe it's like if I show up at a at a family party once every five years, but so I think to me, that's okay. That's right. Yeah.",story,27_37,P,id,,"Haan. Main sach bolu toh main unhe bilkul nahi dekhta. Par agar main unhe dekhu aur shayad agar main ek family party pe paanch saal mein ek baar aau, phir bhi mujhe lagta hai ki woh theek hai. Wahi toh hai. Haan."
38,You're satisfied with your relationship with them?,routine,27_38,T,orq,,Kya tum unse apne rishte se santusht ho?
39,"I think so. I mean, you know, it's not my fault that they won't accept who I am.",routine,27_39,P,od,,"Mujhe lagta hai. Tum samajh rahe ho na, ki main ki baat kar raha hoon, meri galti nahi hai ki woh mujhe mera asli hona nahi maan rahe hai."
40,"Are you aware of any medical conditions that like your mother and father might have or your grandparents,",routine,27_40,T,irq,,क्या आपको उस खतरनाकी के बारे में पता है जो आपके माता-पिता और दादा-दादी को हो सकती है?
41,"like heart disease or anything like back in the medical? My grandpa had like heart disease. My grandfather had cancer but he beat colon cancer was in like the first stage but he was fine after. But as far as my parents, they don't have any medical issues that I know of.",story,27_41,P,id,,"Kya heart disease jaisa koi bhi cheez ya kuch bhi medical mein hota hai? Mere dada ji ko heart disease tha. Meri dada ji ko cancer tha par wo colon cancer ka shikar the, par wo pehle stage mein the aur uske baad theek ho gaye. Lekin mere maa baap ko toh mujhe koi bimari pata nahi hai."
42,"All right, how about kind of same question except for mental health conditions.",routine,27_42,T,irq,,"Thik hai, kuch esa socho par ab mental health conditions ke alawa."

But",story,27_45,P,id,,"Woh magnetic jaise use karti hai I guess jo ki bipolar hota hai, par humne kabhi ek clear label nahi diya usse dipole bipolar ya koi therapy jaise cheez. Lekin fir bhi."

48,Do you have any special family traditions?,routine,27_48,T,irq,,Kya aapke paas koi khaas parivariyek parampara hai?
49,"I mean, we would go on family vacations. When I was a kid. We were constantly staying at the best hotels and stuff like that. Because a mom, you know, would shop around, she actually would Book Three hotels, and just decide which one she liked better when we got there. I don't, I don't know. But anyway, we would do that we would go on vacations together, we would always go down to the beach. So that was really our family tradition as far as in like holidays. We did when we were younger. We would have like our family over for Christmas and stuff like that. But",story,27_49,P,id,,"Arrey, hum toh family vacations pe jaye thay. Jab main chota tha. Hum hamesha sabse acche hotels mein hi rehte thay aur aise kuch cheezein. Kyunki mom, pata hai na, wo bahut shopping karti thi, actually wo Teen hotels book karti thi, aur jab hum pahunchte thay toh decide karti thi ki kaunsa hotel usse zyada pasand hai. Pata nahi yaar, par hum waisa hi karte thay, hum vacations pe jaate thay humesha saath mein, hum hamesha beach pe jaate thay. Toh woh tha hamari family tradition jaise ki festivals ke time pe. Jab hum chote thay. Humare gharwale bhi aate thay humare saath Christmas ke time pe aur aise hi kuch cheezein. Lekin"

But she has she has two kids. And she's actually still married to her to her husband. They were actually highschool sweethearts, so I don't have where my mom came from but and I hadn't seen her probably since I graduated high school. And, you know, she associates my mom and they talk amongst themselves so I don't really have a relationship with her either. So",story,27_55,P,id,,"Meri extended family? Toh mere dad ki taraf se, mere uncle, woh bohot safal hai. Aur woh ek cool aadmi hai, pata hai, mein use ab nahi jaanta hai. Par jab mein baccha tha tab mein use jaanta tha. But ab mein use kabhi nahi dekhta. Sach mein, mujhe kisi se bhi milne ko mauka nahi milta. Par haan, mere mom ki taraf se, unke ek behen hai. Woh bohot pagal hai, par mere mom se utni hi pagal nahi hai. Woh 2 bacche bhi hai. Aur woh ab bhi apne husband se shaadi shuda hai. Woh dono actually high school ke sweethearts the, toh mujhe mere mom ki family ka pata nahi hai par unhe dekha maine jab se mein high school se graduate hua tha. Aur woh mere mom se connect karti hai aur hum ek dusre se baat karte hai, par mujhe unse koi rishta nahi hai. Toh"

I don't know if that's, you know, she was considered an alcoholic but she would drink often. And I think just to come off of her shopping a lot she would drink or vice versa. Sometimes she would drink or shopping or just to calm down, she would drink and sometimes in our drinking habits, she would actually be nice to me.",story,27_59,P,id,,"कुछ कबि मुझे पता होना जब आप मैँ उबार बड़ा होता मै पानी पीना लगी मेरी माँ बोलें लेकिन वह जितनी प्यारी थे मेरे लिये जब ताकि वह पानी पाना था फिर भी वह पीना लगी और हाँ, वह आसानी से फुयां थी जब मैं पाना था उसके लिये। मैँ हमेशा उसकी खरीदारी के साथ गी थी।वह स्वसुग मे वो पानी लेने मेरे लिये।कभी वह पानी लेती थी लेकीहन मेरे साथ या पानी लेती थी या सुकू राखने के लिये वह पानी लेती थी और जब सायद वह पानी पिउगी, वह मुझे अधिक अच्छा काम बाकी थी।"
