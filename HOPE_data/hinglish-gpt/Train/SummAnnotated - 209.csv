Kya koi aur badlav hue hai, kya koi badalte the tere vichar mein shayad? Kabhi kabhi log humein batate hai ki unke vichar kisi tarah se badal gaye hai.

44,Okay. So you're getting thought put into your brain that aren't your own? What about a different sort of experience? What about the experience that somehow other people are able to know what you're thinking even though you haven't actually told them?,symp/reasoning,209_44,T,irq,,"Thik hai. Toh aapke dimaag mein unke vichaar aa rahe hain jo aapke nahin hain? Aur agar koi alag tarah ki baat ho? Kya pata dusron ke paas aapki soch ho, chahe aapne unhe sach mein bataya ho ya nahin?"
45,Nothing like that. Just putting stuff in my head,symp/reasoning,209_45,P,id,,Kuch bhi nahi aisa. Bas apne dimaag mein cheezein daal raha hoon.

51,"Well, it's it's a tracking device so they know where I am all times in there. I could I could feel it moving around rotating",symp/reasoning,209_51,P,cd,,"Arey, ye ek tracking device hai jiski madad se voh jaante hain ki main har waqt kahaan hoon.

",symp/reasoning,209_58,T,irq,,"Ye toh tere liye bahut hi mushkil samay lagta hai. Kya main tumse pooch sakta hu Andy, tum is sab se kaise nipat rahe ho? Ye tumhe kaise prabhavit kar raha hai?"

So have to wait till they go out and  I get out to bring food but they have been doing stuff to my food.",symp/reasoning,209_59,P,id,,"Achha, main jaanti hoon hum mera kamra mein bahut rehte hain. Isliye unke bahar jaane tak wait karna padega aur phir main bahaar jaakar khana laaungi lekin woh meri khane ke saath kuch kaam kar rahe hain."
60,"Okay, what do you think's happening to your food?",symp/reasoning,209_60,T,irq,,"Theek hai, tum sochte ho ki tumhara khana kya ho raha hai?"

I just wanted to check. that hadn't been your experience.",story,209_106,T,yq,,"Thik hai, main sochta hoon ki wajah jo main check kar raha tha woh yeh hai ki kabhi kabhi jab log aise anubhav kar rahe hote hain jaise aap kar rahe hain, unhe mahsus hota hai ki agar woh kuch dawai lete hain, toh sab kuchh aur bura lag sakta hai. Bas main check karna chahta tha ki aapne aisa kuchh anubhav toh nahin kiya."

108,"Okay, okay. Appreciate from what you're saying, You're really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy and that that's the cause of the difficulties that you're having at the moment. I just wanted to check with you Do you think it could be due to anything else? And I mean, I've obviously met other people who've had similar experiences, and sometimes they're extremely stressed, some people might be mentally unwell, and it's worth it whether any of these things might be relevant to you at the moment.",symp/reasoning,209_108,T,gc,,"Theek hai, theek hai. I appreciate what you're saying, you're really very worried about this MI5 conspiracy and that's the reason behind the difficulties you're currently facing. I just wanted to confirm with you, do you think there could be any other reason for it? And I mean, I've also met other people who have had similar experiences, and sometimes they're under a lot of stress, some people might be facing mental health issues, and it's worth considering if any of these things could be relevant to you at the moment."
109,"No, because I'm not ill. ",symp/reasoning,209_109,P,id,,"Nahi, yahaan tak ki mujhe bimaar nahi hai."

Mainey kuch bhi galat nahi kiya hai, mujhe nahi pata ki ve mere saath aisa kyu kar rahe hain."
112,"Okay. Sure, I think I can appreciate that. I guess what I'm wondering is whether you think there's anything that someone like me might be able to do to help you as a doctor that sometimes meeting with someone like a psychiatrist or having medication or for some people even coming into hospital for a short time might be helpful. Do you think any of those things would help you at the moment?",story,209_112,T,irq,,"Thik hoga. Thoda, main sochti hun ki main usko samajh sakti hun. Mujhe to yeh poochna hai ki kya tumhe lagta hai ki main tumhari madad kar sakthi hun jaise ki ek psychiatrist se milna ya dawai lena ya kuch logon ke liye hospital mein jaana bhi kuch help ho sakthi hai. Kya tumhe lagta hai ki abhi koi bhi cheez tumhari madad kar sakthi hai?"

114,"Well, I certainly believe that you're having a really difficult time at the moment, I guess I'm not too sure about is what's causing this and I'm, I'm less sure this is due to MI5 is what I'm wondering, is it perhaps you're not as well as you might be at the moment. I mean, we've been through a lot of questions And what I'm thinking is we need to try and come up with a way of supporting you through this Someone drink cuz I know your mom is I think she's waiting in the waiting room might be a good chance now to get your mum in and then perhaps the three of us can put our heads together, have a bit of a discussion about where to go from here and try and think of getting you some some proper support. Would that be alright if I got your mum in?",symp/reasoning,209_114,T,id,,"Well, main toh maanta hoon ki tumhari halat bahut mushkil hai abhi aur pata nahi meri soch sahi hai ya nahi ki yeh kis wajah se ho raha hai aur mujhe itna yaqeen nahi hai ki MI5 ismein zimmedar hai.

Humne kafi sawal kiye hai aur mere mann mein yeh khayaal hai ki humen tumhe is mushkil waqt mein support karne ka tareeqa dhundhna hoga. Kya main tumhe peeene ke liye kuch de sakti hoon kyunki mujhe maloom hai ki tumhari maa yahaan khade hai, shayad ab theek mauqa hai tumhari maa se milne ka aur hum teeno yahaan milke soch sakte hai ki hum kya kar sakte hai aur tumhe kaise proper support dilwa sakte hai. Kya agar main tumhari maa ko bulao toh koi problem nahi hoga?"
