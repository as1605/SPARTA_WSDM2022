0,So what's on the agenda for today.,inactive,111_0,T,irq,,Toh aaj ka agenda kya hai?
1,"Definitely my dad. He's been on my case, like all week getting on me. It's been a real jerk in my room playing video games and talk to my friends and just barges into my room. You know, he's getting on me at dinner. He just never lets up and he's on the about, you know, getting a job get my life together. All the time. It's like, as soon as I wake up in the morning, you know, there's an email from or, you know, something, just tell me to do stuff I don't want to do. It doesn't get the, you know, I'm not feeling good. And I'm not gonna do that.",symp/reasoning,111_1,P,id,,"Definitely daddy se haalat kharab hai. Pichle week se mere peeche pada hua hai. Mere kamre mein video games khelta hua aur meri dost se baat karta rehta hai, bas meri jaan hi nikal rahi hai. Shaam ko dinner mein bhi peeche pada rehta hai. Kabhi bhi maamla sambhalne ka mauka nahi deta hai, bas job dhundhne aur apni zindagi sambhalne ki baat karta rehta hai. Poori zindagi mere peeche pade rehte hain. Subah uthkar jab main apna email check karta hoon, tabhi usse kiya gaya kaam yaad dilata hai jise maine karna nahi chahta. Mujhe bina puchhe hi kaam karne ko kehta hai. Meri tabiyat kharab hui hai aur main aisa nahi karunga."
2,"So let me so let me interrupt you for just a second here. Make sure I understand you. You're really upset about your father getting on you this past week, right? Yeah. And it's something that we could talk about today is just something that you think we could do to help the situation out?",routine,111_2,T,id,,"Toh mujhe ek minute ke liye aapko rukne do. Main aapko samajhne ki koshish kar raha hun. Kya aapke pita ke is hafta aap par chadhte hue aapko bahut naraz the, sahi toh? Haan. Aur aaj hum is baare mein baat kar sakte hain, ya phir aapko lagta hai hum kuch madad kar sakte hain is halat ko theek karne ke liye?"
3,"Yeah, we got to figure out some way to get him to back off. Okay, he's just on me. I don't maybe we can bring him in here. You know, tell them something. write him a letter, I don't know, but something that could just get him to leave me alone.",symp/reasoning,111_3,P,id,,"Haan, humein kuch tarike sochna padega usse peeche hatane ka. Thik hai, wo bas mere peeche hai. Mujhe nahi pata hum kuch toh usse yaha bulake kehte hain. Kucch likhna hoga usko, mujhe nahi pata, lekin koi aisa cheez jo sirf usko mujhe akela chodh de."
4,"Well, one idea would be to get him to bring him in here and get him to back off, but he's not here right now. And maybe there's some things that you can do to help him calm down or back up the situation on",routine,111_4,T,id,,"Ek idea yeh ho sakta hai ki uss se yahaan laane ke liye usse yahaan laane ka prayaas karein aur usse peeche hatane ka prayaas karein, lekin abhi woh yahaan nahi hai. Aur shayad kuch cheezein aap kar sakte hain jisse woh shaant ho jaaye ya haalaat ko kuchh peeche jaaye."
5,He's the one being a jerk.,routine,111_5,P,id,,Vohi wahi ek lafanga hai.
6,"Well, that may be but maybe there's things you could do to be a little more assertive with him to let him know how you're feeling? Or perhaps to calm the  situation down.",routine,111_6,T,yq,,"Well, ye ho sakta hai lekin shayad tum kuch kar sakte ho uske saath thoda zyada bahaduri se taki wo jaan sake ki tum kaise mehsoos kar rahe ho? Ya phir situation ko shaant karne ke liye kuch kar sakte ho."
7,"I don't know. If you've got some ideas all listen, I guess. But",routine,111_7,P,on,,"Mujhe nahi pata hai. Agar tumhare pass kuch ideas hain toh main zaroor sunti rahungi, shayad. Par"
8,"okay, well, maybe we can put our heads together and come up with some strategies to deal with your dad a little bit better. All right. Is that suddenly? Is that something we could put down in the agenda then?",routine,111_8,T,irq,,"Okay, chalo, maybe hum apni minds milakar kuch strategies soch sakte hain apne dad se behtar deal karne ke liye. Theek hai. Kya suddenly hua hai? Kya hum usko agenda mein likh sakte hain?"
9,"Yeah, no, I definitely want to talk about so how",routine,111_9,P,id,,"Haan, nahi, main toh pakka baat karna chahta hoon ki kaise"
10,do I describe that then? dealing with my dad. Okay. Dealing with Dad.  Is there anything else you'd like to put on the agenda?,symp/reasoning,111_10,T,irq,,Kya main tab baat karu? Apne papa se dealing karti hu. Thik hai. Papa se dealing kar rahi hu. Kya koi aur cheez aap agenda mein add karna chahte hain?
11,"I've been really tired lately just been sleeping a lot. Okay, last week or two.",routine,111_11,P,id,,"Me abhi lately bohut tired hu, bas bahut so rhe hu. Okay, last week ya do."
