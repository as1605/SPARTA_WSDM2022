5,"I went for that scan and then I was a bit surprised actually, they actually rang me up and a few days afterwards and said that I needed another scan to check things out. Okay, so I was there. It was on Monday this week. Don't let anything then.",story,203_5,P,id,,"Maine uss scan ke liye gaya tha aur phir mujhe thoda surprise hua, kyunki woh log mujhe baad mein phone karke kuch dino baad bata rahe the ki mujhe ek aur scan ki jaroorat hai.

10,Okay. And I do have any thoughts yourself or any worries about why they were calling back?,story,203_10,T,irq,,Theek hai. Aur mere paas kisi tarah ke khayal aapke apne ya kisi bhi chinta ho iss baare mein ki kyun unhone phir se phone kiya tha?
11,I guess it was gallstones.,story,203_11,P,id,,मुझे लगता है कि यह ग
12,So just tell me a little bit about what symptoms you've been having them but we do have a scan result here today and there's some scuffs on it.,symp/reasoning,203_12,T,irq,,Toh bas mujhe thoda batao ki tumhe kya kya lakshan dikh rahe hai par humare paas aaj scan ke parinaam hai aur us par thodi si chaalein hain.
13,Right.,inactive,203_13,P,ack,,Theek hai
14,"I just like to make sure that I know what's been happening to you first of all, and then we'll go into detail ",routine,203_14,T,id,,"Mujhe bas yeh dekhna pasand hai ki main pehle tere saath kya ho raha hai, aur phir hum zeeyaada vistar se baat karenge."

16,Yeah.,routine,203_16,T,ack,,Haan.
17,"And then I saw your colleague, and he said we better get a scan. Yeah, I went for that scan. It was only about two weeks ago. And I got literally four or five days later. got the phone call? I needed this additional scan. So I went on Monday.",symp/reasoning,203_17,P,id,,"Aur phir maine aapke sahpaatak ko dekha, aur usne kaha humein ek scan karwana hi hoga. Haan, maine wohi scan karwaya. Woh to kuchh do hafte pehle hi tha. Aur mujhe literal four ya panch din baad mil gaya tha. Woh phone call mila tha kya? Main is additional scan ki zaroorat thi. Isliye maine Somvaar ko uske liye gaya."
18,Okay. Okay. And so do you still have pain at the abdomen?,symp/reasoning,203_18,T,irq,,Thik hai. Thik hai. Aur kya aapke pet mein dard ab bhi hai?

20,"Okay. Well, as I said, you scan result has come through to me today. ",symp/reasoning,203_20,T,id,,"Theek hai. Toh, jaise maine kaha tha, aapki scan ka parinaam aaj mujhe mil gaya hai."
21,Yes,symp/reasoning,203_21,P,ack,,Haan
22,I'm afraid I'm afraid there is something that's potentially a little bit worrying on it.,symp/reasoning,203_22,T,id,,मुझे डर है कि इस पर कुछ ऐसा है जो थोड़ा-सा चिंताजनक हो सकता है।
23,Really?,routine,203_23,P,crq,,Sach mein
24,Yeah.,routine,203_24,T,op,,Haan.
25,So what's what's the worrying thing that you found?,routine,203_25,P,irq,,So kya woh woh cheez hai jo aapne dhoonda hai jo pareshan kar rahi hai?
26,"Well, if I take you back to the first scan first. So what it appears that that showed is that there was something suspicious on what we call the pancreas gland",symp/reasoning,203_26,T,id,,"Well, agar main aapko pehli scan ki taraf le jaun, toh wahaan jo dikhta hai woh yeh hai ke pancreas gland mein kuch shaqhta aisa hai."
27,suspicious?,routine,203_27,P,crq,,Sandeha
28,"Yeah. So there is a gland that sort of the top of your abdomen, which is quite closely evolved, right, and called the pancreas. And when they did the ultrasound scan, which is a good scan, but isn't particularly detailed, right, there was something on it that they saw that they wanted a bit more info ",symp/reasoning,203_28,T,cd,,"Haan. Toh there is a ग्लैंड jisko आपके abdomen ke ऊपर ठीक से विकसित किया गया है, right, aur usse pancreas कहा जाता है. Aur when unhone ultrasound scan kiya, jo ek achcha scan hai, par उसमें खासकर कोई ज्यादा details नहीं होती है, right, उसमें कुछ ऐसा दिखाई दिया जो उन्हें थोड़ी सी more info चाहिए थी."
29,All right.,inactive,203_29,P,ack,,Theek humesha thik hai
30,So that's why they called you back for the second scan,symp/reasoning,203_30,T,cd,,Isliye yeh taaki woh tumhe doosre scan ke liye vapas bulaya hai
31,"That doesn't sound good, does they?",symp/reasoning,203_31,P,irq,,"Yeh bilkul achha nahi lag raha, kya woh hain?"
32,"which was a CT scan, which is a detail that we're likely to be talking about. ",symp/reasoning,203_32,T,id,,"Ye CT scan tha, jo ham baat karne ke zyada yogy ho sakte hai."
33,Right.,inactive,203_33,P,ack,,Theek hai
34,"So the second scan, I showed that there definitely is something on your pancreas.",symp/reasoning,203_34,T,id,,"So second scan mein, maine dikhaya ki aapke pancreas par zaroor kuch hai."
35,Really?,inactive,203_35,P,crq,,Sach mein
36,"When I say something, what we worry about is whether or not this could be a cancer",routine,203_36,T,cd,,"Jab main kuch kehta hoon, hum mein yeh chinta hoti hai ki kya yeh cancer ho sakta hai ya nahi."
37,"god. I didn't expect that. God, I am only 47 cancer. ",routine,203_37,P,id,,भगवान। मैंने ऐसा नहीं उम्मीद किया था। भगव
38,"I'm really sorry to have to break it to you like this, but I felt that it was important that as soon as I knew that I communicated that to you. So, I mean, I know that I've just dropped a big bombshell on you.",routine,203_38,T,id,,"मैं सच में तुम्हें ऐसे बताने के लिए बहुत खेद हूं, लेकिन मुझे लगा कि जब हो सके उसे तुम्हें देना आवश्यक है। तो, मेरा मतलब है, मुझे यह पता है कि मैंने तुम्हारे लिए एक बड़ा गोली चलाई है।"
39,"Oh, yes. God",routine,203_39,P,gc,,"Haan, haan. Bhagwan"
40,Have you got any Any questions in a minute? Have you got anything that you can query?,routine,203_40,T,yq,,Kya aapke paas ek minute mein koi sawal ho? Kya aapke paas koi cheez hai jiske baare mein aap pooch sakate hain?
41,What's the pancreas and I have got cancer. What can I can make can they cut it out?,symp/reasoning,203_41,P,irq,,"क्या है पैंक्रिएस और मुझे कैंसर हो गया है। मैं क्या कर सकता हूँ, क्या वे इसे काट सकते"
42,"And it depends. And basically a pancreas is a brand that sort of sits at the top of the abdomen, as I said, and it controls some of the sort of the hormones, the fluids that your body prefers the body. Because it's at the back of the abdomen, often we don't know very much about it until it starts causing a bit of a problem, like your pain that you've been getting. So that probably explains why you've not had many other symptoms. ",symp/reasoning,203_42,T,id,,"Aur yeh us par nirbhar karta hai. Aur mulaayamata hone par ek pankreas ek brand hota hai, jaisa ki maine kaha hai, aur yeh zyadatar abdomen ke sabse upar rehta hai, aur yeh humare sharir ka kuch hormones aur fluid ko control karta hai. Kyunki yeh abdomen ke piche hota hai, toh hum uske baare mein jyada nahi jaante hain jab tak ki yeh dard jaisi samasya nahi paida karta hai, jaise tumhe ho raha hai. Isiliye shayad tumhari aur koi symptoms nahi hain."
43,Right,routine,203_43,P,ack,,Sahi hai
44,"And the answer is, I don't know what could be done about it. But we need to ask a specialist  what we usually do. This situation is asked especially today to see what has happened, think about what was cooking. Right? Do they agree that it could be potentially cancer and how do we find out what it definitely is",symp/reasoning,203_44,T,id,,"Aur uttar hai, mujhe pata nahi kya kiya ja sakta hai iske bare mein. Lekin hume ek visheshagya se puchna chahiye ki hum aamtaur par kya karte hain. Ye paristhiti aaj visheshata se puchi ja rahi hai ki kya ghatna ghati hai, kya pak raha tha. Theek hai? Kya wo sahmat hain ki ye sambhavat: cancer hai aur hum kaise pata lagayenge ki ye nishchit roop se kya hai?"
45,Okay. Okay.,inactive,203_45,P,ack,,Thik hai. Thik hai.
46,So I understand that I've just thrown a whole lot of information at you and,routine,203_46,T,id,,Maine samajh liya hai ki maine aapke paas bahut sari jaankari fekh di hai aur
47,I just hasn't expected that so.,routine,203_47,P,id,,यह मैंने सिर्फ इतना ही उम्म
48,"I mean, is there is there anybody that you could that you could bring in with them? Oh, quit I went on a bit of a chat maybe tomorrow when you've had a bit. Bit more time.",routine,203_48,T,irq,,"Arre yaar, koi hai jisko tum saath le sakte ho? Arre chhodo yaar, kal baat karenge, jab tumhe thoda sa waqt mil jaye."
49,"I suppose I could love myself. No doubt come by myself actually. Yeah, okay. It will just be easier. Feel Sure. ",routine,203_49,P,id,,"Main sochta hu ki main khud se pyaar kar sakta hu. Bina shak khud se hi gujar sakte hai, sach mein. Haan, thik hai. Yeh bas aasan ho jayega. Yakeen rakho."
50,"I mean, I think it's important to say that we don't know for definite what this is. We have to imagine that it is something like a cancer until we can prove what is right. So we do everything very quickly. Yeah, try and get some answers. Right. But we don't know any definite nothing certain in a minute. But I do appreciate that. I've just given you a little bit of time. So my door is open and yes. Okay. Have you got any questions?",symp/reasoning,203_50,T,yq,,"Mera matlab, mujhe lagta hai ki kehna zaroori hai ki hum pakka nahi jaante ki ye kya hai. Humko sochna hoga ki ye kuch aisa hai jaise ek cancer, jab tak hum sahi baat ko sabit na kar sake. Toh hum sab kuch bahut jaldi karte hain. Haan, koshish karte hain ki kuchh jawaab mil jaaye. Theek hai. Lekin ek minute mein humko kuch pakka nahi pata hai. Par main samajhti hoon. Maine aapko thoda sa samay diya hai. Toh meri darwaza khula hai aur haan. Theek hai. Kya aapke paas koi sawaal hai?"
51,No.,inactive,203_51,P,on,,Nahi.
52,"I've taken the liberty of printing off a little bit of something about pancreatic cancer, if that's what it is. ",symp/reasoning,203_52,T,id,,"Maine ne aapke liye hum ek chota sa kuch print kar diya hai, use pancreatic cancer ke baare mein hai agar wo hi hai."
53,"Okay,",inactive,203_53,P,ack,,Thik hai
54,"some of it's a little bit a little bit scary. And as I said, we don't know, nothing certain yet. I wonder if you might want to come back to see me. So what this does is it just explains a little bit about what the pancreas is right? ",routine,203_54,T,id,,"""Kuch cheezein thodi darawani lagti hai. Aur jaise maine kaha, hume abhi tak kuch pakka nahi pata hai. Mujhe yeh sooch raha hai ki kya tum wapas aakar mujhse milna chahoge. To yeh karne ka yeh hai ki iss mein pancreas kya hota hai, theek?"""
55,Okay.,routine,203_55,P,ack,,Hainji

57,okay. Okay.,inactive,203_57,P,ack,,thik hai. Thik hai.
58,How we do it and how we work out what we do about it talks about the different types of scans that you've had and this one is CTS.,routine,203_58,T,yq,,"Hum ham isse kaise karte hain aur ham kya karna chaahte hain isse baat karte hain, ye humare liye kiye gaye alag prakar ke scans ki baare mein hai aur ye ek CTS hai."
