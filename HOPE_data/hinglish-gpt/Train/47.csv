4,Last week you were talking in therapy?,inactive,47_4,T,irq,,Aaj mein terapiles mein baat kar rahi thi kya?
5,"Yeah. I mean, I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week, but but Jill was telling you about Jill, a co worker. And, you know, she was kind of bothered me the past couple weeks, but really, this this past week was like the worst, right? So she's not doing her paperwork. And the thing is, is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports. So if she doesn't have hers, I can't do mine. And then I can't get mine out in time for the next person to do theirs and it's a mess. The whole thing's a mess. And it's just it's annoying.",symp/reasoning,47_5,P,id,,"Haan. Main mandaakaar, se main Pichhale hafte ke baare mei zyada sochahoon, but Jill ne tumhe Jill ke baare mein bataya tha, ek saath kaam karne waale. Aur tum jaante ho, usne mujhe pichhale do hafton se takleef de rahi thi, but iss hafthee saari zindagi ka sabse bura tha, na? Toh woh apna paperwork nahi kar rahi hai. Aur saplai yeh hai ki, mere report karne ke liye, usko yeh reports karni padhti hai. Toh agar uske paas unki report nahi hai, toh main apni report nahi kar sakta. Aur phir main apni report nahi pichhle waqat tak pahuncha sakta hoon aur iss cheez mei badi mushkil hogai. Pura mamla abhi bhi ek bada tangled mushkil hai. Aur saara mamla bas pareshaan karne wala hai."
6,"So her work slow down, or not being efficient work is affecting your work productivity.",symp/reasoning,47_6,T,gc,,"Itna uski kaam ki slow down hai, ya phir efficient nahi hone ki wajah se uski kaam aapke kaam ki productivity par asar dala hai?"
7,"Yeah. Yeah, it definitely is. And it it's one of those things that like,",routine,47_7,P,ack,,"Haan. Haan, yeh bilkul hai. Aur ye woh cheez hai jo aiisi aik baat hai jo jaese jaesi ho rahee hai,"
8,"you know, has, it gives me a bad",routine,47_8,P,id,,"You know na, has, it gives me a bad feeling."
9,"a bad evaluation, you know, like, if I'm not in my stuff in in time, the number reflects negatively on me, you know, and it's it's all kind of she's she's the first level, you know, and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time. So she doesn't, then I don't then the next person and so forth, and it makes it seem",story,47_9,P,id,,"Ek kharab mulyankan, tu jaanta hai, jaise, agar main apni chizon ko waqt par nahi karta hu, toh number mujhpar nisphal asar daalte hai, tu jaanta hai, aur yeh sab uski buri tarah level pe nirbhar hai, tu jaanta hai, fir sabhi dusri levels uske waqt par kaam karna hai. Agar woh nahi karti, toh main nahi karti, uske baad wala vyakti aur aage bhi, aur yeh sab lagta hai."
10,"like you're not doing her job,",routine,47_10,P,id,,"tum uska kaam nahi kar rahe ho,"
11,"right? Yeah. And my boss doesn't like it. my boss's boss doesn't like and so forth. You know, and I try to explain them. You know, she's the problem, but it doesn't always I don't always have the time to go up and tell them like, here's what's happening or just somehow it doesn't Now,",story,47_11,P,id,,"Sahi toh, aur mere boss ko pasand nahi hai. Mere boss ke boss ko bhi nahi pasand hai aur aage bhi waise hi hai. Pata hai, main unko samjhane ki koshish karta hoon. Pata hai, woh hi samasya hai, par hamesha mauka milta nahi ki main unko bataoon ki, yahaan kya ho raha hai ya phir koi tareeka nahi milta ki main somehow explain kar do. Ab toh..."
12,you don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation.,routine,47_12,T,yq,,आपको हमेशा मौका नहीं मिलता कि आप अपने काम में महत्वपूर्ण लोगों को स्थिति के बारे में बता सकें।
13,"Yeah. And that's pretty annoying too. Because,",routine,47_13,P,ack,,"Haan, aur woh kaafi annoying bhi hai. Kyunki,"
14,"you know, it's one thing if people get mad at me, but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job, like I'm supposed to. But it's another thing for them to get mad at me. Not realizing it's not my fault.",story,47_14,P,id,,"तू तो जानता है,अगर लोग मुझे गुस्सा दिखाएं तो ठीक है, पर उसके बाद मैं उन्हें बता सकता हूं कि मैं अपना काम क्यों नहीं कर रहा हूं,जैसा कि मुझे करना चाहिए है। लेकिन ये दूसरी बात है कि वे मुझ पर गुस्सा हों। मुझे नहीं पता कि ये मुझकी"
15,"You know, you have an explanation for why that works.",routine,47_15,T,crq,,"तुम्हें पता है, तुम्हारे पास वह तरीका है जो इस काम के"
16,"Yeah, I do. I do. That's the thing. But I can't always get it out. You know, I can always tell the person that's has the complaint about and yeah, I mean, I've tried talking to my, my boss. And I've tried talking other people too, you know, but really hasn't gotten anywhere.",story,47_16,P,ack,,"Yeah, I do. Main toh kar leta hoon. Wohi baat hai. Par hamesha bahar nahi nikal pata. Pata hai, main hamesha us vyakti ko batasakta hoon jiska shikayat hai aur haan, meri koshish hai maine apne boss se baat ki hai. Aur maine dusre logon se bhi baat ki hai, par kuch bhi hasil nahi hua."
17,So you're feeling stuck with this whole thing?,routine,47_17,T,irq,,Kya tum is poore mamle mein phanse huye mehsus kar rahe ho?
18,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean,",inactive,47_18,P,ack,,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean,

Haan. Haan, main matlab yeh,"
19,"I talked to Joe a little bit about it, too. You know, and I tried to ask, I tried to kind of gently reminding her, you know, like, such and such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock. I didn't want to be real abrasive, you know, but I, I tried to remind him as a polite approach. Yeah. Yeah. And it didn't didn't really seem to work because it's still happening. You know,",story,47_19,P,id,,"Maine Joe se thoda baat ki, aur maine usse pyar se yaad dilane ki koshish ki, aapko bhi bata du, ki Tuesday ko 12 baje tak yeh jaruri hai ki submit kare. Mujhe kisi ko gussa diladena nahi tha, lekin maine pyar se yaad dilaya. Haan. Haan. Par yeh kaam ab bhi ho raha hai. Aapko pata hai."
20,your attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you want.,routine,47_20,T,crq,,Tumhare duniya mein masle ko theek karne ki koshish abhi tak bilkul kaam nahi kari hai jaise aap chahte the.
21,"It really hasn't. And, and that's just, I feel like I've tried everything that I could try.",routine,47_21,P,cd,,"Yeh sach mein nahi hua hai. Aur, aur yeh toh bas, mujhe lagta hai maine jo kuch bhi karne ki koshish ki hai, woh sab try kar liya hai."
22,"You know, and even like, I came home and I",routine,47_22,P,cd,,"Tum jaanti ho, aur hai bhi, main ghar aa gaya aur maine to."
23,"was talking to a friend about it, and",routine,47_23,P,cd,,"Main apne dost se iske bare mein baat kar raha tha, aur..."
24,"I was trying to think of other solutions, right. You know, I was trying to think like, what else I could do what else I could say. Who else I could talk to things like that. You know, and my friend, you know, you He was listening and stuff. He had some good suggestions, but he didn't know what to do either like cuz he doesn't know the way the company works.",story,47_24,P,cd,,"Main soch raha tha ki aur koi haal, samjha hai na? Main soch raha tha ki kya aur kar sakte hain, kya aur bata sakte hain. Aur kaunse logon se baat kar sakte hain, aise hi baatein. Tum samjhte ho na, aur mere dost, tum jaante ho na, tum Bhi meri baat sun re the aur kaam ki baatein. Usne bhi kuch acche sujhav diye, but woh bhi nahi jaanta tha ki kya karna hai, kyunki usko kampani ka kaam pata nahi hai."
25,"So like, I got nothing. You're not getting the help you need for this.",routine,47_25,P,cd,,"Toh vaise, mujhko kuch nahi mila. Tumhe iske liye sahi madad nahi mil rahi hai."
26,"Yeah, not at all feeling pretty lost with it. And I wish there was just like a",routine,47_26,P,cd,,"Haan, bilkul nahi lag raha mujhe iske saath bahut confuse ho gaya hun. Aur main chahta hun ki kewal ek ese ho jaise ek"
27,clear way to do things like this is what you should do now. And I don't see anything some,routine,47_27,P,cd,,Saaf aur sahi tarika hai aise kaam karne ke liye jo abhi tumhe karna chahiye. Aur mai kuch nahi dekh raha kuch hai hi nahi.
28,sort of clear plan.,routine,47_28,T,yq,,कुछ साफ साफ योजना।
29,"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,47_29,P,ack,,"Haan, haan."
30,"But yeah, I don't",inactive,47_30,P,on,,"Lekin haan, main nahin hoon."
31,"I don't see a way to go about it. I mean I've so I've Okay, so this is the way I laid out in my mind. I tried talking to the people above me didn't work out the way I thought it would. I tried talking to the people below me so to speak, just lower on the before me in the process. That's what I mean. And that didn't work out which is just Jill and I talked to her and that didn't work.",story,47_31,P,id,,"Mai uss baat ko karne ka koi tareeka nahi dekhta. Main kya keh raha hu yeh mere dimaag mein mujhe lay out karna tha. Main upar waalo se baat karne ki koshish ki par wo meri soch ke mutabik nahi gayi. Main neeche waalo se bhi baat karne ki koshish ki, na koi kaam ban saka jo neeche mere pehle ke logon ka hota hain. Yahi toh main keh raha hu. Par wo bhi na kaam hua, sirf Jill ke saath baat hui aur wo bhi nahi hua."
32,"So like, there's nowhere else I could turn.",routine,47_32,P,id,,"Toh aise hi, kahi aur meri koi madad nahi kar sakta."
33,The options are exhausted.,routine,47_33,T,od,,Options khatam ho chuke hain.
34,"Yeah, that's what it seems like to me.",inactive,47_34,P,ack,,"Haan, yehi to mujhe lagta hai."
35,And this is frustrating for you.,symp/reasoning,47_35,T,gc,,Aur yah aapke liye pareshani ka karan hai.
36,"Yeah, it is. And I've been trying to wrack my brain. You know, like, what else could I do? You know, like, maybe if I could maybe if there was like, a committee or something that I could go to, you know, and be like, well, this person's not doing what they're supposed to be doing. But there's not a committee like that. Or even if there was like a person, you know, like, a resolution person or whatever, but there's nobody like that.",story,47_36,P,ack,,"Haan, yeh toh hai. Aur main apne dimaag ko dhamkane ki koshish kar raha hun. Pata hai, jaise, kuch aur main kar sakta hun? Pata hai, jaise, ho sakta hai main agar koi committee ke paas ja sakta hun, aur yeh kahun, ki bhai, yeh insaan woh kaam nahi kar raha hai jo woh karna chahiye. Lekin aisa koi committee nahi hai. Aur agar koi insaan ho bhi, jaise, resolution wala insaan, lekin woh bhi nahi hai."
37,There's no other avenue. ,inactive,47_37,T,id,,Koi aur raasta nahi hai.
38,"It sort of seems like to me Yeah. I mean, that's",inactive,47_38,P,ack,,"Yeh mere liye thoda sa lagta hai, haan. Mera matlab, woh toh hai hi."
39,"and you know, as I'm even trying to think like,",inactive,47_39,P,gc,,"aur tum jaante ho, kyun ki mujhe bhi sochna chahiye ki..."
40,"I don't know, should I Write a letter to somebody maybe. But I don't even know who or what",routine,47_40,P,gc,,"Humko pata nahi hai, kya main kisi ko ek letter likhu maybe. Par mujhe yeh bhi nahi pata ki kaun ya kya."
41,you thought about a letter.,routine,47_41,T,irq,,tumne ek letter ke baare mein socha.
42,But who would you send it to?,routine,47_42,T,irq,,Lekin tum usko kisko bhejoge?
43,Yeah.,inactive,47_43,P,ack,,Haan.
44,Or like just something else that I can I can do instead of going to this person though to that person that didn't work.,routine,47_44,P,id,,"Ya fir mai bas kuch aur kar sakti hun, is jagah jaane ki bajay us vyakti se, jis vyakti se yeh kam nahi chala."
45,Can I can I,inactive,47_45,P,id,,Kya main kar sakta hoon?
46,"call somebody is there anybody else in the company that you know might handle stuff like that? But I mean, there's there's HR people, but",routine,47_46,P,id,,"क्या आप किसी को कॉल करते हैं? क्या कंपनी में कोई और है जो ऐसी चीजें संभाल सकता हो? लेकिन मेरा मतलब है, कि हमारे पास हाईआर लोग तो हैं,"
47,I can't really see where they could come in. I don't know how human resources could deal with something like that.,routine,47_47,P,id,,"Main dekh nahi paa raha kahan se wo aa sakte hai. Mujhe pata nahi hai ki manav sanchaar kitna bada muamla hai, jaise ye log uske saath nibha sakte hai."
48,You don't view them as a potential solution.,routine,47_48,T,crq,,Tum unhe ek potential solution ke roop mein nahi dekhte.
49,"No, I don't.",inactive,47_49,P,on,,"Nahi, main nahi hun."
50,Wondering if there's like a,routine,47_50,P,cd,,Sochne ki Kya baat hai ki kya jaisa hai?
51,"But there's I mean, I'm thinking now that there's gotta be something or somebody, or somewhere that I could put in, like, almost like a complaint or something like, something's out of my hands. And I don't know what to do about it, but there's got to be something. And now that I'm saying this, I'm thinking that there's got to be",story,47_51,P,cd,,"But yaar, I mean, I'm thinking now that there must be some thing or some one or some where I could put in, like, almost like acomplaint or something, cuz something's out of my hands. And I don't know what to do about it, but there's got to be something. And now that I'm saying this, I'm thinking that there's got to be"
52,some other resource you haven't tried yet.,routine,47_52,T,irq,,kuch aur resourc
53,"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,47_53,P,ack,,"Haan, haan."
54,"I mean, now I'm trying to think back to my training, you know, initially",routine,47_54,P,id,,"Mera matlab hai, ab mai apne training ko yaad karne ki koshish kar rahi hun, pata hai, shuruat mein"
55,"you know, maybe there's, you know what, I think now that I'm, now that I'm thinking a little bit harder about a little bit differently about it. I'm thinking that there's like, man, I forget what they call it now, but maybe like a complaint but It's not the right word, but maybe a complaint box or like suggestions or something. And I think, if I remember correctly, those suggestions and those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting, which we have, like every other week.",story,47_55,P,id,,"Tu jaanta hai, shayad, tu jaanta kya hai, main soch raha hu ki ab main, ab main thoda aur zyaada soch raha hu uske baare mein thoda alag tarike se. Main soch raha hu ki shayad hai, yaar, main bhool gaya ab woh kya kehte hai, lekin shayad koi shikayat hai par yeh sahi shabd nahi hai, lekin shayad koi shikayat ka dabba ya phir sujhav hai ya kuch aur. Aur main sochta hu, agar main sahi yaad kar raha hu, toh woh sujhav aur shikayat har staff meeting pe uthaya jaata hai, jaise ki humare paas, har do hafton mein ek baar."
56,They're discussed at this regular meeting.,routine,47_56,T,gc,,Unhe iss normal meeting mein discuss kiya jata hai.
57,"Yeah. And I'm thinking now, I mean, nobody really uses it. But I'm thinking like, maybe that's an avenue that I can use, you know, like, maybe that'll get brought up. And maybe that's something that that might actually work. ",story,47_57,P,gc,,"Haan. Aur main iss soch raha hoon, yaani ki koi asal mein iska estemaal nahi karta. Lekin main soch raha hoon, shayad woh ek sadak ho sakta hai jisko main estemaal kar sakta hoon, yaani ni barha sakti hai. Aur shayad woh cheez hai jisko haqeeqat mein kaabo kar sakta hai."
58,This could be another option for you.,routine,47_58,T,orq,,Yeh tumhare liye ek aur vikalp ho sakta hai.
59,"Yeah, it could be. And then if it does work, it'll get brought rather if they do read it, it'll get brought up at the staff meeting. where everybody's at my boss, my boss's boss, Jill, everybody's there. And maybe that's a way for it to come to most attention. That deadlines being missed, affect other people in ways that you don't really know about.",story,47_59,P,od,,"Haan, shayad ho sakta hai. Aur phir agar kaam ho jaye, toh wo staff meeting par utaya jayega. Jahan sab meri boss, meri boss ki boss, Jill, sab honge. Aur shayad yehi tarika ho is baat ko zyaada dhyaan dilane ka. Yeh hai ki deadlines ki kami, isse kisi aur ko bhi asar padta hai, jiske bare mein tum sach mein nahi jante."
60,So everyone will hear your complaint,routine,47_60,T,gc,,Toh sab sunenge tumhara shikayat.
61,and maybe react in a way to help you maybe.,routine,47_61,T,gc,,Aur shayad tumhe meri madad karne ke tarike mein react kar saku.
62,"Yeah, I think that's, I mean, that's gotta be the way to do it. And maybe that's the best way. I really think. Yeah, I mean, after saying all that, and after going through that, I really think that that's probably the best way to do it. And if it doesn't, then I guess I can find another way. But I really think that's the best way to do it.",story,47_62,P,gc,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai ki vo hi, matlab vo karna hi hoga. Aur shayad vo hi sabse behtar tarika hai. Asal mein, yeah lagta hai. Haan, matlab jab yeh sab kaha, aur uske baad usse guzre, mujhe yaqeen hai ki vo hi shayad sabse behtar tarika hai. Aur agar vo nahi hai, toh shayad main ek aur tarika dhundh sakta hu. Lekin mujhe sach mein lagta hai ki vo hi sabse behtar tarika hai."
63,You feel as though you found an option here?,routine,47_63,T,irq,,Kya tumhe yahaan ek vikalp mila hai ki nahi lagra hai?
64,"Yeah. Yeah. And even if that doesn't work, then it'll be brought up. And maybe it'll allow me to talk to my boss further about it. And maybe I'll understand really where I'm coming from. But this will at least be a start to something you know, to make me a lot less stressed with deadlines and stuff in",symp/reasoning,47_64,P,id,,"Haan. Haan. Aur agar yeh kaam na ho, tab bhi ye uthaya jayega. Aur shayad mujhe iske baare mein apne boss se aur bhi zyada baat karne ki ijazat ho. Aur shayad main thik se samajh sakoon kahaan se aa raha hoon. Lekin kam se kam ye kisi shuruat ki shuruaat hogi jiske liye main kamzor deadlines aur cheezon mein baithkar kam karne se kam stress hoga."
65,your first Started with all this.,routine,47_65,T,crq,,आपकी पहली शुरुआत सब इसके साथ ह
66,"Yeah. But maybe, maybe after I do that, you know, put in the complaint or suggestion.",symp/reasoning,47_66,P,cd,,"Haan. Lekin shayad, uske baad main wo karun, tu jaan le, shikayat ya sujhav daal do."
67,Maybe I won't be as frustrated.,routine,47_67,P,cd,,Shayad main itna frustrated nahi hounga.
68,"I mean, I'm feeling a little less frustrated now. Even thinking if there is another option.",routine,47_68,P,cd,,"Mujhe matlab hai, main ab thoda kam pareshan mehsoos kar raha hoon. Soch raha hoon ki kya koi aur vikalp hai."
69,It feels better now as you're contemplating and another potential Avenue here.,routine,47_69,T,gc,,Abhi aap soch rahe ho toh accha lag raha hai aur yahaan ek aur shaktishali mauka bhi hai.
70,"Yeah. Yeah, that's,",inactive,47_70,P,ack,,"Haan. Haan, vahi to,"
71,"well, this might be a good place to wrap this session up.",inactive,47_71,T,gt,,"Well, yeh shayad session wrap karaane ke liye ek accha jagah hai."
72,That feels like the right.,inactive,47_72,P,gt,,Woh sahi lagta hai.
73,Move for you. Yeah. And we'll schedule See you next week. And we can pick up from there. Sounds good. All right. Cool. Next car. Thank you.,routine,47_73,T,gt,,Tumhare liye chalo. Haan. Aur hum aayojit karenge apko agle hafte milenge. Phir se shuru kar sakte hai. Achha lag raha hai. Theek hai. Aage vali gaadi. Dhanyavaad.
74,summary,"The patient has an issue with their co worker who has not been doing their paperwork for the past couple of weeks. This annoys the patient and affects their efficiency in work productivity. The co worker is first in line and it affects everyone's work which their boss doesn't like. The patient doesn't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at their work about the situation and that is annoying too since people get mad at the patient. The patient feels stuck. They have tried to talk to the co worker Joe, but it didn't seem to work. The patient feels they are not able to find a clear plan and have exhausted all options. The patient does not know whom to complain to at the company since there is no committee and feels HR might not be of help too. The patient thinks of a complaint box with which they could pass on the complaint. They feel even if it is not resolved, it will brought up in a meeting and they will be able to discuss with their boss and a feel a lot less stressed. The patient feels better just thinking of another option. The therapist schedules following session next week. ",,,,,
