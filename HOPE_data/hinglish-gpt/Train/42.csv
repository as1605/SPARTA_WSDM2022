Par, ye kism ka chakkar badi kam hota hai. Isiliye main chahta hu ki tu yaha baith kar mujhe kisi aka ka naam na lekar Yo, main sharabi nahi hu."
6,"Okay, so it seems like you get offended and feel offended. being referred to it. ",routine,42_6,T,yq,,"Theek hai, toh aisa lagta hai ki tumko bura laga aur tum bura feel kiye jaate ho. Uspe refer karke."
7,"Yeah, exactly. ",routine,42_7,P,ack,,"Haan, bilkul."

Haan. Thoda sa thik hai. Abhi toh humare paas thoda sa waqt hai. Agar tumhe theek lagta hai. Main ye soch raha tha ki hum thoda tumhari sharab peene ki aadat ke baare mein baat kar sakte hain.
9," Yeah, sure. ",routine,42_9,P,ack,,"Haan, zaroor."
10,Sure you what is drinking do for you?,symp/reasoning,42_10,T,irq,,Tu sure hai ki tum drink karne ke liye kya karte ho?
11,"Well, you know being 25 that's what we do. Like we get together we hang out we get a couple of drinks. It's me and my girls. We do this all the time and I love this. It breaks the ice when we go socialize. So, meet new people kind of thing. You know, girlfriend circle. It's fantastic. And it definitely relaxes me after a stressful week and my weeks are so stressful as I need this, you know? So, I mean, yeah, but just so you know, I do drink responsibly and I never drink and drive and I don't intend on doing that. ",story,42_11,P,id,,"Abey, tu janta hai na, we being 25 we khudse hi yahi karte hai. Like hum milkar milte hain, couple of drinks lete hain. Yeh main aur mere dosti hai. Hum yeh baar baar karte hain aur main isse bahut pasand karta hun. Yeh logon se mile toh tum samajh hi sakte ho, dost circle hai. Yeh toh zabardast hai. Aur yeh bilkul mere liye relaxation hai stress ke baad, mere saare weeks bahut stressful hote hain, toh yeh main zaroor chahta hun, samajh raha hai na? Toh, haan, lekin tu janta hai, main responsible drinking karta hun aur na kabhi drink and drive karta hun aur na hi kabhi woh karne ki irada rakhta hun."
12,"Okay, so to me, it seems that drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends. It's your way to socialize and it breaks that is right, it helps you socialize and, you know, I'm I also wanted to say that it's very responsible of you to be drinking and not driving. Thank you. How has it affected your life?",story,42_12,T,irq,,"Theek hai, mujhe lagta hai ki tumhare liye peeena tumhara tariqa hai apne doston ke saath relax karne ka. Yeh tumhara tariqa hai socialize karne ka aur yeh sahi hai, yeh tumhe socialize karne mein help karta hai aur, pata hai, main yeh bhi kehna chahti hoon ki tum drink karne aur driving nahi karne mein bohot zimmedar ho. Shukriya. Tumhare jeevan par kaise asar hua hai?"
13,"Who hasn't? Well, I mean, none of this happens and you have it because of that firefight. And he's gonna be disappointed. Sorry. I guess you could say that my relationship with Henry, it's been great, fantastic. But he says that when I drink, it's like, I'm not myself. It's like somebody who's never met before. And obviously, you can imagine the arguments, the fights, and oh my god, all that stress. It's just, I love them so much, but you know, but it's a stress and it's like, I don't forget to make it.",story,42_13,P,id,,"Kaun nehi kiya? Acha, matlav, iski koi baat nahi aur ye sab hota bhi nahi agar wo agnipariksha nahi hoti. Aur wo nirash ho jayega. Maafi chahiye. Maaf karo. Mujhe lagta hai ki meri Henry ke saath rishta, behat badiya hai, khush-khabri se hai. Lekin wo kehta hai ki jab mai sharab peeta hu, to mujhse tarah-tarah ki mana lete hain. Wo aise lagta hai ki mai koi parichit nahi hu. Aur bilku, aap soch sakte hain, jhagde, ladaiya aur mere oh my god, etna sab tension hai. Bas, mai unse bohat pyaar karti hu, lekin tension bhi hai aur aisa lagta hai ki, sab kuch peeche chal gaya hai."
14,"So for my understanding, drinking, it helps you socialize with friends, it relaxes you. It's, you know, your way of just, you know, it breaks that ice for you. On the other hand, it's causing that a lot of arguments with you and your significant other Henry. Yeah. And it's causing a lot that all those arguments are leading to a lot of stress in your relationship, this kind of stuff.",story,42_14,T,gc,,"Mere samajhne ke liye, peene se aap doston ke saath socialize kar sakte hain, aapko aaram milta hai. Yeh aapki, aap jaante hain, aapka tarika hai sirf, aap jaante hain, aapke liye ice ko todne ka. Dusri taraf, yeh Henry aur aapki aham baat ke kaafi jhagde paida kar rahi hai. Haan. Aur yeh bahut saari tanav ko aapke rishte mein laa rahi hai, yeh tarah ki cheezein."
15,"Yeah, I mean, we're engaged in this as well. Like you put it that way, I mean, worried because what's he going to think of you later on in life? What's he going to tell our children? Oh, your mom's an alcoholic. She drank this and they got into fight. I don't want I don't want anyone to ever think of me that way. But at the same time, I mean, I don't want to quit cold turkey. I mean, you must understand how hard this is for me to even be here and talk about it. But I love him so much. I mean, I would do anything for him. And he's going to be so disappointed in me hasn't even seen him like, I don't know, how can I face them?",story,42_15,P,id,,"Haan, mera matlab, hum bhi isme shamil hain. Bilkul, tum waise hi bol rahe ho, matlab, pareshan kyunki woh tumhare baare mein kya sochega zindagi mein? Woh humare bachon ko kya batayega? Arre, tumhari mummy sharabi hai. Woh yeh peeli aur phir unko jhagda hua. Main nahi chahti ki koi bhi mujhe aise hi soche. Lekin usi samay, mera matlab, main turant chhodna nahi chahti. Mujhe pata hai yeh mere liye kitna mushkil hai yahan tak aakar baat karna. Lekin main usse bahut pyar karti hoon. Main uske liye kuch bhi karungi. Aur woh mujhse itna nirash hoga, abhi tak toh usko dekha hi nahi, pata nahi, main unse kaise mulaqat karungi?"
16,This seems like a very lucky guy to have someone love him that much.,routine,42_16,T,id,,Yeh ek bahut lucky banda lagta hai jo use itna pyaar karne wala koi hai.
17,"Boy, seriously, he's not gonna find anybody that loves him. As much as I do. Trust me on that is not going to happen.",routine,42_17,P,od,,"Boy, seriously, voh kisi bhi ko nahi dhundh payega jo use itna pyaar kare. Jitna main karti hoon. Mujh par bharosa karo, voh nahi hoga."
18,"So what I'm getting here right now is that if you do want to quit, yeah, yeah. And it's just partly because this alcohol is divided into the arguments with Henry and his positive SSL relationship. Yeah. I know we spoke about earlier and I know you don't really like like the idea of it but what do you know about it? Like what's your one shed some light on that",story,42_18,T,irq,,"To chaliye dekhein mai kya samjh rahe hun abhi ke ab agar aap chhodana chahte ho to, haan, haan. Aur yeh bas uski wajah se hai ki yeh alcohol Henry aur uske positive SSL relation ke arguments mein bataya gaya hai. Haan. Mujhe pata hai pehle humne iske baare mein baat ki thi aur mujhe pata hai ki aapko is idea se bilkul bhi pasand nahi hai, lekin iske bare mein aapko kya pata hai? Kya aap iske bare mein kuch light daal sakte hain?"
19,"it's a place where alcoholics go to discuss their problems and like I said, I'm not an alcoholic.",routine,42_19,P,id,,"Ye ek jagah hai jahan sharabi apne masle pehle baatcheet karte hain aur jaisa ki maine kaha, main ek sharabi nahi hoon."
20,"Well, you're a different multiple philosophy life and this share the drinking stories, and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together. Okay? I know you don't want to join a at this point in time 10 times but hypothetically speaking, generally consider joining it maybe later on down the road.",story,42_20,T,irq,,"Toh dekh na, tu ek alag-alag multiple philosophy wali zindagi ji raha hai aur isme sharab peene ki kahaniya share kar raha hai, aur har koi ek dusre ki madad kar raha hai sober rehne ke safar mein sath mein. Theek hai na? Mujhe pata hai tu abhi 10 baar dene ka mann nahi hai par sochte hue, agar baad mein agar soche toh consider kar koi join karne ka."
21,If this is what I have to do to get my guy back and I'll do it.,routine,42_21,P,id,,"Agar yeh hi hai jo mujhe apne ladke ko waapas pane ke liye karna hoga, toh main zaroor karungi."
22,"Okay, well on a scale of one to 10 being like for sure. And one being not really sure about it at all. What would you say where you are on the scale with God any? ",routine,42_22,T,irq,,"Toh thik hai, ek se das tak ka scale hai, jahan ek matlab bilkul bhi nahi hai aur dus matlab pakka hai. Tum scale par kitne ke pas ho God ke sath?"
23,"You put it that way? Everything I told you, I would say Six, ",routine,42_23,P,crq,,"Aapne ne aisa bola? Sab kuch maine bataya tha, main che se kahungi."
24,six. Yeah.,routine,42_24,T,ack,,"Six, haan."
25,"Well, it's all about, it's all about Henry at the end of the day, it's it matters to me if I want to keep this engagement, and I will do anything for that man. So of course, this is what I have to do in this. This is him. Let him tell you, his relationship with me. And I'm with him is so much more important to me than drunken nights at a bar.",story,42_25,P,gc,,"Arey, sabki baat hai, yeh sab Henry ke baare mein hota hai, mujhe farak padta hai agar main yeh engagement nibhana chahti hoon, aur us aadmi ke liye main kuch bhi karungi. Toh haan, yahi toh mujhe karna padega. Yeh woh hai. Ise karne do, woh bataega, uski humari rishtey mein Farak hai kya. Aur mere liye woh mere saath kitna zaruri hai compared to nashaile raatien bar mein."
26,"I love you, man. Like I said.",routine,42_26,T,gc,,"Me tereko pyaar karta hu, yaar. Jaise maine bola."
27,I'll tell him that.,routine,42_27,P,gc,,Main use usko bata dunga.
28,"Yeah. So right now we're sitting at a six or what needs to happen. Maybe we can jump that money or nine,",routine,42_28,T,od,,Haan. Toh abhi hum six par baithe hain ya jo kaam karna chahiye woh ho sakta hai. Shayad hum us paise ko chala sakte hain ya nau par.
29,"um, you know, like, flexible hours, maybe that isn't even an option. Um, also, maybe there's maybe there's a place nearby somewhere like nearby My house, I'll be great. So I have to use gas because it's expensive already to go to work and it's far anyway. And I'm like, I guess, I guess it has to do with attitude as well. I don't want to sit there in a circle like this and somebody judging me because the way I look in my drinking habits and all that, so I guess I'm just looking for a good vibe, you know, I don't want to be judged or labeled.",story,42_29,P,id,,"Arre bro, tu toh jaanta hai na, like, flexible hours, maybe uske bas mai option hi nahi hai. Aur haan, kahi aisa jagah toh ho yaar pass, meri ghar ke bhi nearby mai, solid. Kyuki mujhe kaam ke liye gas bhi toh use karni padegi, kyunki already mahengi hai aur wo bhi door hai. Aur mai aisa bhi hu na, ki attitude bhi matter karta hai. Mai wahaha baithna nahi chahta jaise koi ungli utha ke mujhe dekhe meri peene ki aadato ko leke, toh mai bas ek achhi vibe dhoondh raha hu, samjha? Mujhe judge ya label kiya jaan hai nahi."
30,"Now, all of these are like very understandable. I mean, it's just Of course, you want some in a meeting to be close to us. You don't have to commute so far. And yeah, we all have very busy schedules. Now the fit is very busy schedule. It definitely makes sense. And of course, the environments I mean, if you're not happy, they're just a human a learning environment. If you're not comfortable there, then it's very hard for you to you know, to be in that environment. Yeah. blotchy today, I was wondering if it's okay with you, I can give you this for sure. It's just for a median. You're really close to your location where you live, okay, and my number is also on there. Give me a call if you have any concerns. And also, I just want to thank you today for sharing me your stage of drinking. And I know it's not, you know, easy to just notice. No, it's a very sensitive subject. Yeah. So I want to thank you",story,42_30,T,id,,"Abhi, ab sab ye bahut samajh me aata hai. Yani ki, taaliy, hamari meeting me kuch humare paas hona chahiye. Aapko itna door tak nahi jaana padega. Aur haan, sabke paas bahut busy schedules hote hain. Ab fit toh bahut busy schedule hai. Ye definitely samajh me aata hai. Aur taaliy, agar aap khush nahi hain, toh woh sirf ek insaan ki learning environment hai. Agar aapko waha comfortable feel nahi hota hai, toh aapke liye us environment me rehna bahut mushkil ho sakta hai. Haan. Aaj mai aapko poochna chah raha tha ki kya aapke liye ye theek hai, main aapko ye de sakta hu. Ye sirf ek meeting ke liye hai. Aapke location ke bahut paas ho jayega, theek hai, aur mera number bhi waha pe hi hai. Mujhe call karein agar aapko koi pareshani ho.

You're very welcome really means a lot.,inactive,42_31,P,gt,,. Mere baare mein sunne ke liye dhanyavaad. Kisi ne mujhse kisi bhi baat ke baare mein baithkar baat nahi ki hai. Mujhe aisa lagta hai ki tumne kisi mudde par kuchh roshni daali hai. Isliye dhanyavaad. Tumhara bahut swagat hai sachmuch bahut kuchh hota hai.

34,summary,"The patient got some stitches and has been in a firefight. The patient was out with their girls, where a girl bumps and pushed the patient's drink. One thing led to another, it was blur and the cops showed up. The patient was intoxicated during the firefight and is offended be called an alcoholic. The patient feels alcohol helps to relax and socialize with friends. The patient's life has been affected because her boyfriend Henry would be disappointed. Henry feels that the patient is altogether a different person when drunk and it is a lot of stress for the patient. The patient loves Henry so much. The patient is asked about community where different people share the drinking stories, and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey of being sober together. The patient says a six on ten for joining that community. The patient finds hassles in joining community in terms of flexible hours, reaching the place if it is far away, and also people judging the patient looking at their drinking habits. The therapist offers a place which is close to the patient's house and asks to call them if needed. The patient is glad to have talked about this. The therapist schedules another meeting in two weeks. ",,,,,
