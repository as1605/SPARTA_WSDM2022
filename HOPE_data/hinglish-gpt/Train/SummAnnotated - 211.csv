1,P,Yes,inactive,,gt,,Haan
2,T,I'm Jane Corona. I'm a medical student with university here,inactive,,gt,,Main Jane Corona hu. Mera yahaan university mein medical ke chhatra hu.
3,P,Nice to meet you,inactive,,gt,,Aap se mil ke achha laga.
4,T,I've been sitting by Dr. Smith is part of our treating as a medical student to do an interview with you. Okay. And then I'll take that information back to Dr. Smith And then she will come back in and see you then after that,inactive,,gt,,"""Main Dr. Smith ke paas baitha hoon kyunki hum aapko interview dene ke liye ek medical student ke taur par ilaj kar rahe hain. Theek hai. Phir main woh jaankari Dr. Smith ko lautaunga aur phir woh aapko dekhne ke liye laut aaegi."""
5,P,okay.,inactive,,gt,,ठी
6,T,All right. How may I address you?,inactive,,irq,,Theek toh. Main aapse kaise sampark kar sakta hu?
7,P,Mrs. Jones is fine.,inactive,,id,,Mrs. Jones thik hai.
8,T,"All right. Thank you. Um, is that okay with you today to talk?",inactive,,yq,,"Theek hai. Dhanyavaad. Um, kya aaj aapke saath baat karne ke liye theek hai?"
9,P,"Yes. Okay, fine, thank you.",inactive,,ack,,"Haan. Thik hai, accha, dhanyavaad."
10,T,I'm going to start out today by just talking a little bit with you about your chief complaint What brings you here today?,symp/reasoning,,irq,,Main aaj shuru karne jaa raha hu bas aapke saath baat karke aapke pramukh shikayat ke baare mein. Aaj aapko yahaan kyon le aaya?
11,P,"Sure, my left elbow is actually been bugging me a lot. Every once in a while, I've been getting a little bit of pain, extending my arm and going back to bending it. Really, that's the primary reason I've come in I've attempted to take a little bit To Tylenol to relieve the pain but it's not really seemed to help much. ",symp/reasoning,,id,,"Haan,maine ek bar Azmaisha leel li, kyunki mere left aunty par bahut zyada pareshaani ho rahi hai. Hana ek do baar, merey hources cooking mein zara se dard hota tha, par main phir se aunty bethnay ka practice karti hoon. Haqeeqatan to, yehi ek sar-e-aam wajah hai ke main yahan par aayi hoon. D-Haan, maine dard ko kam karne ke liye teen - chaar boond Tylenol kahaa, par yeh kaafi nahin saabit hua hai."
12,T,"Okay, before we talk a little bit more about that, is there anything else that you want to talk with either me or Dr. Smith today?",routine,,yq,,"Thik hai, pehle hum uske baare mein thoda aur baat karte hain, kya aapko aaj mujhse ya Dr. Smith se kuch aur baat karni hai?"
13,P,Not that I can think of no.,routine,,on,,मैं सोचने से पहले उसके बारे में
14,T,Okay. Tell me more about this pain.,symp/reasoning,,irq,,Teekhi. Is dukh ke baare mein aur batao.
15,P,"Um, it's just kind of a throbbing pain, it'll act up kind of randomly throughout the day. It doesn't it's not specific to, you know, the morning or evening, or even in the middle of the day or night. It just kind of randomly acts up. I would say excessively, like when I'm doing work, like after the dishes will start to act up. If I, you know, lift one of my children up, it'll start to act up. So any sort of exertion is kind of where I've noticed a lot of the pain coming from",symp/reasoning,,id,,"Yaar, it's bas kind of ek throbbing dard hai, wo kabhi kabhi randomly din bhar mei activate hota hai. Ye nahi specific hai, subah ya sham, ya raat ke beech. Ye bas randomly activate hota hai. Meri paas ye isht excessive hai, jab main kaam kar rahi hu, jaise ki main bartan dhona ke baad, ye activate ho jati hai. Agar main apne baccho mei se ek ko uthaungi, toh ye activate ho jayegi. So, har tarah ka exertion ye pain activate kar deta hai."
16,T,and tell me when did it start for you?,symp/reasoning,,irq,,"Aur tum mujhe batao, kab se tumhare liye shuru hua?"
17,P,I would send every about maybe a week and a half to two weeks ago.,symp/reasoning,,id,,"Mujhe shayad har ek hafte ke baare mein bheja jaayega, lagbhag do hafto se pehle."
18,T,And you describe the pain is throbbing. Is there anything else about the pain in terms of the quality of the pain that you want to describe for me?,symp/reasoning,,yq,,"Aur tum batao ki dard dhadak raha hai. Kya tumhe dard ki koi aur quality ke baare mein bhi batana hai, jaise dard ka swabhav, mujhe bataane ke liye?"
19,P,No Just really throbbing,symp/reasoning,,on,,"Nahi yaar, bahut hi dardnaak hai."
20,T,"okay, started about a week to two weeks ago. Okay. And do you recall what you were doing at the time that it started?",symp/reasoning,,yq,,"Theek hai, roughly ek hafte se do hafte pehle se shuru kiya tha. Theek hai. Aur kya aap yaad karte hai ki tab aap kya kar rahe the?"
21,P,"I've been helping my husband clean out the garage lately, and we were lifting some boxes. And that's kind of I didn't notice it at the moment, but later in the evening, started to act up. ",symp/reasoning,,id,,"Mai ne apne pati ko kuch dino se garage ki saaf-safai mai madad kar rahi thi, aur hum kuch dabbay utha rahe the. Aur iske baare mai mai pehle notice nahi kiya, lekin baad mai sham ko, yeh start ho gaya."
22,T,"Okay. Umm I would like to hear about a little bit about the severity of it on a pain scale of one to 10, 10 being the worst pain you've ever had one or zero being no pain at this, How bad is this pain?",symp/reasoning,,irq,,"Okay. Hmm, main chahunga ki aap ek pain scale ke hisab se ise kitna dard hai, jisme 10 sabse bura dard hai jo aapne kabhi mahsoos kiya hai, aur ek ya zero matlab koi dard nahi hai. Is dard ka kya haal hai?"
23,P,I would measure it probably six or seven. It's become more of a nuisance than an actual physical pain.,symp/reasoning,,id,,Muze maine shayad usko chhe ya saat mein naapna hoga. Yeh ab ek asli sharirik dard se zyada ek pareshani ban gaya hai.
24,T,Okay. And is it a six or seven all the time?,routine,,yq,,Thik hai. Aur yeh kya saath ya saat hamesha rahta hai?
25,P,"Um, whenever it starts to act up, yes. ",routine,,id,,"हाँ, जब यह बिगड़ना शुरू होता है,"
26,T,Okay. And how often a day does that happen?,symp/reasoning,,irq,,"""Theek hai. Aur yeh kitne baar ek din mein hota hai?"""
27,P,I would say maybe two to three times per day.,symp/reasoning,,id,,Main shayad din mein do se teen baar bol sakta hoon.
28,T,Do you notice any pattern to that at all?,symp/reasoning,,yq,,Kya aap usmein koi pattern notice karte hain?
29,P,No.,symp/reasoning,,on,,Koi n
30,T,Okay. All righty. And can you point exactly to Where it is for me the location exactly?,symp/reasoning,,irq,,Okay. All righty. Aur kya aap mujhe bilkul sahi jagah bata sakte hain jahaan yeh location hai?
31,P,Kind of the area that just kind of wraps around the actual elbow than it is really bothering me.,symp/reasoning,,id,,"वो क्षेत्र जो सिर्फ त्वचा को घेरता है, वास्तव में मुझे परेशान करता है।"
32,T,And does that pain go up your arm or down your arm or anywhere else on your arm?,symp/reasoning,,yq,,Aur kya woh dard aapke haath mein ya haath se niche ya haath ke kisi aur hisse mein hai?
33,P,No It stays right in that area.,symp/reasoning,,id,,Nahi woh uss area mein hi rehta hai.
34,T,Is there anything else that goes on at the same time? Any other symptoms that happen anything else other than when the pain is happening there anything else going on for you?,symp/reasoning,,yq,,Kya ek samay mein aur kuch aur hota hai? Koi aur lakshan hote hain kya? Kya dard hone ke alawa kuch aur ho raha hai? Kya aap ke liye kuch aur chal raha hai?
35,P,"Not that I've noticed, No.",symp/reasoning,,on,,"Mujhe lagta nahi hai ki maine dhyan diya hai, Nahi."
36,T,Is there anything that makes it feel better?,routine,,yq,,Kya kuch aisa hai jo isse accha mehsoos karaye?
37,P,"Um, nothing that completely gets rid of it. I will relieve it for a temporary period of time. But it hasn't gotten rid of it.",routine,,id,,"Um, kuch aisa nahi jo poori tarah se usse chhutkara dila de. Mai ise thodi der ke liye kam kar dunga. Lekin ye abhi bhi usse mukti nahi dila paaya hai."
38,T,And how much time it will do take?,routine,,irq,,Aur kitna samay lagega?
39,P,I whatever it says on the bottle usually wanted to tablet,routine,,id,,"Maine jo bhi botal par likha hota hai, wahi goli lena chahta tha main."
40,T,is that regular strength or extra strength?,routine,,yq,,यह नियमित मजबूती है या अतिर
41,P,regular strength.,routine,,op,,regular takat.
42,T,You just take it across the counter to normal directions on the bottom.,routine,,crq,,Tum bas use counter ke upar le jao aur bottom par normal directions follow karo.
43,P,correct,inactive,,cd,,मु
44,T,Okay. And does anything make it worse?,routine,,yq,,Thik hai. Aur kya koi cheez ise aur bura banati hai?
45,P,"Um, like you mentioned any sort of exertion, picking up a child doing the dishes, pretty much daily kind of living. ",story,,id,,"Bhai, jaise ki tune kaha koi bhi mehnat karne wali cheez, bacche ko uthana, ya din-bhar ke zindagi mei kaam karna."
46,T,So using it.,inactive,,crq,,Toh ise istemaal kar rahe hain.
47,P,Yes.,inactive,,ack,,Hanji.
48,T,Have you seen anybody else for this complaint?,routine,,yq,,Kya aapne is shikayat ke liye kisi aur ko dekha hai?
49,P,"Um, no. ",routine,,on,,"Please, na."
50,T,Have you What else have you tried other than the Tylenol and anything else?,symp/reasoning,,irq,,Kya tumne Tylenol ke alawa aur kuch try kiya hai?
51,P,"Um, I've attempted to use a heating pad on it. And I've also attempted ice. Neither were successful. ",symp/reasoning,,id,,"मैंने उम, मैं उस पर एक हीटिंग पैड का प्रयास किया है। और मैंने इसे ठंडा करने का भी"
52,T,"Okay. It sounds you've talked a little bit about how it's impacted, you know, you to be able to work in the garage or do the dishes or lift your child is there Other impact on your life,",symp/reasoning,,crq,,"Okay. It sounds like you have talked a little bit about how it has impacted you, you know, to be able to work in the garage, do the dishes, or lift your child. Are there any other impacts on your life?"
53,P,Umm like I mentioned is more of a nuisance. There'll be times in the middle of the night that will start to act up. If I get up to go to the bathroom. I'll notice pain in my elbow.,routine,,cd,,"Umm jaisa maine kaha tha, woh zyada takleef ka bais hai. Raat ke beech mein kabhi kabhi uski haalat kharab ho jaati hai. Agar main uth kar bathroom jaao, toh mujhe apne elbow mein dard mehsoos hoga."
54,T,Does it wake you up at night?,routine,,yq,,"'


Kya yeh tumhe raat mein uthaata hai?"
55,P,"It doesn't, but if I wake up in the middle of the night Well, trouble me and falling back asleep. ",symp/reasoning,,on,,"Yeh samasya hai, lekin agar main raat ke beech mein jagaun, toh mujhe pareshani hogi aur phir se neend mein jaane mein dikkat hogi."
56,T,Okay.  What do you think it is?,symp/reasoning,,irq,,Thik hai. Tumhe lagta hai kya yeh hai?
57,P,"Um, I'm not quite sure my best guess is maybe some sort of pulled muscle or something. But I honestly don't know.",symp/reasoning,,id,,"अरे, मैं ठीक से समझ नहीं पा रहा हूं, मेरी सबसे अच्छी अनुमान है कि कुछ मांसपेशियों को खींच लिया हो या कु"
58,T,"All right. What I'd like to do now is just kind of go through all the things that you told me and summarize for you. This is information that I want to take that but I want to make sure that I have it all correct. So if I've forgotten something, or I've gotten something incorrect, please, please help me. ",routine,,id,,"Thik hai. Vah koi bhi kaam nahi karna chahta hun abhi jo aapne mujhe bataya hai use dhyan se dekhunga or aapke liye saransh kar dunga. Yeh jaankari hai jo mujhe lehni hai par mai ye bhi yaad rakhna chahta hun ki mai sab theek se samajh raha hu. Agar maine kuch bhul gaya hai ya kuch galat samjha hai, toh kripya mujhe batayein."
59,P,Okay.,inactive,,ack,,Thik hai
60,T,"You came to the clinic today for a complaint of left elbow pain, and it's pain that you mostly noticed when you were bending it or using it in some capacity. It's a throbbing pain that happens randomly, but it does happen two to three times during the day, which you notice about is if you exert or you extend or flex your elbow at all, that's when it seems to be at its worst. It's gone on for about a week, maybe two, two weeks when you think back on it, and it started out when you were helping your husband clean the garage and you were lifting locks of boxes. So about a six to seven on a pain scale. And you describe it over and over as being a nuisance, which tells me that it's getting kind of in the way of doing some things that you want to you report that it happens probably two to three times a day, and that the pain wraps around the joint. Completely, you've taken some Tylenol for it across the counter, you've taken that several times a day now with without much relief",symp/reasoning,,id,,"आपने क्लिनिक पर, आज बाईसेपेट के दर्द की शिकायत के लिए आने का फैसला किया था, और यह दर्द अधिकतर तब हमें अहसास होता है जब आप इसे मोड़ते हैं या इसका इस्तेमाल करते हैं। यह एक दर्द ये है जो अनियत रूप से होता है, लेकिन यह दिन भर में दो से तीन बार होता है, जो आपने अपने कोशिश करते हुए आपको इसकी सबसे बुरी तरह से महसूस कराया गया है। इसका चलता है लगभग एक से दो हफ्ते तक, शायद आप इसका अनुसरण करते हैं, और यह जब शुरू हुआ जब आप अपने पति की सहायता करते हुए गैराज साफ कर रहे थे और आप ने कई बॉक्स को खींचा। इसमें एक से सात दर्जे के बीच का दर्द है। और आप बार-बार इसे दिक्कत आने की अवस्था में समझाते हैं, जो मुझे बताता है कि यह कुछ चीजों को करने में आपकी राह बना रहा है, आप रिपोर्ट करते हैं कि यह लगभग दो से तीन बार एक दिन में होता है, और दर्द जोड़ को पूरी तरह से घेरता है। आपने कुछ टाइलेनॉल लिया है जो आसानी से मिल जाता है, और आपने उसे अपने दिन में कई बार लिया है लेकिन कोई दिलासा नहीं मिला।"
61,P,right,inactive,,ack,,thik
62,T,"that it hasn't helped much. You've also tried a heating pad, you've tried some ice, that hasn't really helped either too much. It sounds like you know, again, you kept referring to it as an as a nuisance. It's just kind of getting in the way of your daily activities. It Doesn't necessarily keep you up at night. But you do notice it at night when you wake up that it's still going on for you. So sleep doesn't seem to help much. And that what you mostly think this could be is a pulled muscle of some type. Is there anything I forgotten or that you wanted to tell me about this?",symp/reasoning,,yq,,"Ki wo kuch zyada madad nahi ki. Tumne bhi koshish ki thi garm patti se aur thandi se, lekin woh bhi zyada kaam nahi aayi. Aisa lagta hai ki tum toh, phir bhi tumne isko pareshani ke roop mein refer kiya. Yeh bas tumhaari aadat karte hue tumhaari roz ki gatividhiyon ko rok rahi hai. Yeh tumhe raat mein uthaane tak toh nahi, lekin jab tum raat mein uthate ho toh tumhe yeh hamesha lagta hai. Toh neend bhi zyada madad nahi karti. Aur aisa lagta hai ki tumko yeh sab se badi baat lagti hai ki yeh kisi aisa akhaara kaat gayi hai. Kya maine kuch bhooli ya yeh tum mujhe is baare mein bataana chahte?"
63,P,I'm not that I can think of no.,inactive,,on,,मैं नहीं हूँ कि मुझे कुछ सोचने के ल
64,T,Thank you for telling me about your chief concerns. So I'm going to take it back to Dr. Smith.,inactive,,gt,,Dhanyavaad aapne mujhe apne mukhya chintaon ke baare mein batane ke liye. Isliye main use wapas le jaaunga Dr. Smith ke paas.
65,P,Thank you very much.,inactive,,gt,,Thank you bahut saara.
