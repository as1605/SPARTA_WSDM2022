0,So I understand that you've come in because you're having a little difficulty in your relationship about that.,routine,101_0,T,irq,,Toh main samajhti hoon ki tum aaye ho kyunki tumhari rishte mein thodi mushkil ho rahi hai uske baare mein.
1,"So, basically, it's been getting a little bit worse since we got married. We got married about a year and a half ago. And, you know, the the woman that I married, I thought we were both kind of independent people. And I thought that we would kind of go our separate ways or thing like we used to college, but it's kind of gotten to the point now where it's like, I just want my own personal space and I I don't want to be left alone sometimes.",symp/reasoning,101_1,P,id,,"Toh, basically, abhi tak, shaadi ke baad thoda dikkat aa rahi hai. Humari shaadi ko lagbhag ek saal aur dhaee saal ho gaye hain. Aur jaisa ki aap jaante hain, maine jo biwi se shaadi ki thi, maine socha tha ki hum dono thoda independent log hain. Aur maine socha tha ki hum alag alag tareeke se apne kaam karenge, jaise hamare college ke time mein karte the, lekin ab situation yeh hai ki mujhe apna personal space chahiye aur kabhi kabhi akela rehna bhi pasand nahi hai."
2,"Alright, so you're looking for independence in your relationship. Now, how long have you been together? About a year?",routine,101_2,T,irq,,"Theek toh, tu apne rishte mein svatantrata ki talash mein hai. Ab, kitne samay se saath ho? Lagbhag ek saal?"
3,"total four or five years, married for a year and a half.",routine,101_3,P,id,,"सम्पूर्ण चार या पांच वर्ष हो गए, एक साल और आधा सुन्नी"
4,"And when Franklin Did you notice that? What you kind of think it was the problem like the independence, lack of independence? ",routine,101_4,T,irq,,"Aur jab Franklin ne dekha kya? Tumhe kya laga ki problem kya thi, azaadi ki kami thi ya kuch aur?"
5,"I guess kind of once we got married after that, it seemed like, you know, we were spending all of our time together, which, you know, at first was great because we're newlyweds, you know, we love spending time together and everything, but I guess probably about, you know, six months to a year after we first got married, it's kind of, you know, progressed to the point where, you know, now it's just kind of becoming like a burden that whatever I do, she's always there with me. We're always spending every waking moment together and sometimes it's just nice to have My own personal space is freedom, you know.",story,101_5,P,id,,"I think after our marriage, it became like, we were spending all of our time together. Initially it was amazing because we were newlyweds, and we enjoyed spending time together, but after around six months to a year of our marriage, it reached a point where now it feels like a responsibility that no matter what I do, she's always by my side. We spend every moment of our day together and sometimes, it's nice to have our own space and freedom, you know."
6,"So you're looking for that freedom. Sarah, this kind of resonate with you?",routine,101_6,T,yq,,"Kya tum us azadi ki talash mein ho? Sarah, kya yeh tumse ekdum juda hai?"
7,Can you can you tell him that?,routine,101_7,T,yq,,Kya tum use bata sakte ho ki?
8,"So Frank, what's it like to hear that?",routine,101_8,T,orq,,"Frank bhai, ye sun ke kaisa laga?"
9,"It kind of Reminds me of how it used to be, you know, like, she said, we've been dating for four or five years and, you know, back then it It wasn't a problem, you know, she could go out and do her own thing I could go out and do my own thing to not have to worry about each other but now that we're spending every moment together, you know, it's just I'm always worried about her she's always worried about me and you know, when when I do get the chance to go you know, hang out with some friends or something like that. It always feels like, you know, I've pressure on me because I should be with her. She shouldn't be there with me, you know, and I feel like I'm doing the wrong thing by trying to be independent try to go do things by myself. I feel guilty. I do.",story,101_9,P,od,,"Yaad rakhta hoon ki pehle kaise thi, tum janti ho, kehti hai, hum 4 ya 5 saal se date kar rahe hain aur pehle yeh koi samasya nahi thi, tum ja sakti thi apna kaam karne aur main bhi ja sakta tha apne kaam karne ke liye aur hum dono ko ek doosre ki fikar karne ki zarurat nahi thi lekin ab hum har waqt saath bita rahe hain, pata hai, mere mann mein humesha uski fikar rehti hai, woh meri fikar karti rehti hai aur jab main apne doston ke saath time bitane ka mauka milta hai ya kuch kaam karne ki zarurat hoti hai toh woh aisa lagta hai, pata hai, ki woh dabaav mujh par hai kyunki main uske saath hona chahiye. Woh mere saath nahi honi chahiye, tum janti ho, aur main apne aap ko independent banane ki koshish kar raha hoon. Mujhe afsoos hota hai, main khud se hi kaam karne ki koshish karne se ghalat lagta hoon. Mujhe koi saza mahsoos hoti hai."
10,"So, Sarah, Do you sense that and, frankly, feels guilty about that?",symp/reasoning,101_10,T,yq,,"Toh, Sarah, kya tumhe mehsoos hota hai ki aur, frankly, uspar galti ka ehsaas hai?"
11,You feel rejected.,symp/reasoning,101_11,T,id,,Tumhe reject mahsus kar rahe ho.
12,"this a little bit after. So, like I said, probably the first six months to a year it was it was really good. But then, you know, reselling is kind of a burden. You know, just always spending time together and trying to make amends and try not to get into fights because we're always spending so much time together.",routine,101_12,P,id,,"thoda sa baad. Toh, jaise maine kaha, shayad pehle 6 mahine se ek saal tak bahut achha tha. Lekin phir, aapko paise kamane ki zimmedari ho jaati hai. Bas humesha saath waqt bitate hue aur sulah karne ki koshish karte rahe aur jhagde se bachne ki koshish karte rahe kyunki humesha saath itna time bitaate hain."
13,"So you mentioned that the six months to a year has been the same for you like was the beginning of the marriage, something different to what you have that",routine,101_13,T,irq,,"Toh tumne mention kiya ki tumhare liye 6 mahine se 1 saal ka samaan raha hai jaise shaadi ka shuruat tha, kuch alag tumhare paas hai."
14,So for you a couple months after that initial phase. So around the same time you started experiencing this difficulty in the marriage,routine,101_14,T,id,,"So for you, kuch mahine baad, us pehle daur ke pehle. Toh lagbhag usi samay mein jab tum is shaadi mein mushkil mehsus karne lage."
15,"Okay, are you okay with some space?",routine,101_15,T,yq,,"Thikai, kya tum kuch space ke saath thik ho?"
16,You don't seem real certain.,routine,101_16,P,od,,Tumhe bahut asal jaankari nahi lagti.
17,"So maybe this, this idea of space isn't really something you feel will work for you.",routine,101_17,T,crq,,"Tu bechara space ke mamle mein kahin ka nahi hain, waise hi tu sochta hain ki ye idea tere kaam nahi karega."
18,Do want to try to address Frank's concerns about the space?,routine,101_18,T,yq,,Kya tum Frank ke concerns ko address karne ki koshish karna chahte ho space ke baare mein?
19,You seem apprehensive about it.,routine,101_19,T,od,,Tumhe isse lekar chinta lag rahi hai.
20,"So maybe just experiment with it, try it for one night and see what happens. So, in the year and a half, you've been married, Is there ever been a night when you've gone out by yourself?",routine,101_20,T,yq,,"Toh shayad bas uske saath experiment kar lo, usse ek raat ke liye try karo aur dekho kya ho jata hai. Toh, aadhe saal mein jo aap shaadi shuda ho, kya kabhi aapne akeli nikalne ka mauka diya hai?"
21,"Yeah, it's been a couple, especially earlier on, which is nice, you know, just, you know, getting to see old friends and you know, our old college friends, like, of course, we attended, you know, events together and like seeing old friends and everything like that, but there's been, there's been a few times, you know, not, not more than I can count on both my hands, but there's been a few times where I've, you know, gone out and just had, like, you know, a guy's night or something.",story,101_21,P,id,,"Haan, yeh kuch mahine ho gaye, specially pehle ke din, jo badiya hai, pata hai, bas, purane dost dekhne ka mauka mil jaata hai, aur wo bhi college ke humare purane doston ko, jaise, hum saath events attend karte the aur purane dost dekhne ka mauka mil jaata tha, par kuch baar toh aise bhi hua hai, haatho par ginne ke layak nahi, par kuch baar toh main bahar gaya aur bas, ek ladkon wali raat hogi."
22,"Okay, and what would happened, like in terms of like between you, so,",routine,101_22,T,irq,,"Thik hai, aur kya hoga, aisi baaton mein jo tumhare aur bich mein hui?"
23,"just getting out of the house is basically the hardest part. You know, just finding a way to ensure That, you know, it'll be okay. I'm going to be back home later on in the night that she doesn't need to worry about me, you know, if I have any trouble or anything pops up that I need her help, I'll let her know. And, you know, just knowing that I love her and telling her that I love her and making sure that she knows that I'll be back. But you know, sometimes it's hard because she just gets upset when I tell her that I'm leaving and she doesn't want me to go and she would rather me stay or even take her with me. And you know, I don't want to be the only guy that shows up with my wife. You know, everybody else left their wives at home also. So I don't want to be the odd man out",story,101_23,P,id,,"Basement se bahar nikalna hi sabse mushkil kaam hai, pata hai na, bas ek tareeka dhoondhna ki yeh theek hoga. Raat mein ghar aakar main baad mein aunga ki usko chinta karne ki zaroorat nahi hai, bas agar koi pareshaani ho ya kuch aisa ho jiske liye uski madad chahiye, main use bata dunga. Aur, pata chale ki main use pyaar karta hun aur use yeh batane ki khushi milti hai aur yeh bhi yaad dilata hun ki main wapas aaunga. Lekin pata hai, kabhi kabhi mushkil hota hai kyunki voh bura ho jaati hai jab main use ye bata deta hun ki main jaa raha hun aur voh chahti hai ki main na jaun ya voh mere saath chale. Aur pata hai, mujhe aisa nahi lagta hai ki main akela hi hoon jo apni biwi ke saath pahunchta hai, sab log apni biwi ko ghar par chhor aaye hain. Isiliye main alag nahi hona chahta."
24,"all right, so this is really an experiment that's already been tried.",routine,101_24,T,crq,,"Theek hai, yeh sach mein ek experiment hai jo pehle se hi kiya gaya hai."
25,"tried twice. Yeah,",routine,101_25,P,cd,,"Do baar koshish ki. Haan,"
26,"yeah. Just Just a few times. Is there any reason to believe that if you try it next week, it'll be different?",routine,101_26,T,irq,,Haan. Bus kuch baar. Kya tumhe vishwaas hai ki agar tum agli hafte koshish karo toh kuch alag hoga?
27,That's not good.,routine,101_27,P,id,,Vah nahi hai.
28,Don't you don't think so.,inactive,101_28,T,orq,,Kya tumhe yeh lagta nahi hai?
29,"Well yeah. mean, we've been doing it, you know, the past couple months, but it seems like every time we do is you know the same result it's her getting worried about me and you know me trying to find a way to assure her that it's gonna be okay and you know that we're so married we're still in love, you know everything like that, but, you know, it's just, I really want my space and it seems like sometimes I just can't get out of her crib.",routine,101_29,P,od,,"Achcha haan. Matlab, hum toh kar rahe the, pata hai, kuch mahine se lekin har baar jab hum jaate hai, wohi hua hai, tumhe pata hai na, wo chinta karti hai meri aur main usse assure karne ki koshish karta hu ki sab theek hoga aur tum jaante ho, hum abhi bhi pyaar mein hai, sab kuch aisa hi hai, lekin, mujhe sach mein apna space chahiye aur kabhi kabhi aisa lagta hai ki main uski god se nikal hi nahi sakta."
30,"Sir, what do you think about that?",routine,101_30,T,orq,,"Sir, kya aap uske baare mein kya sochte hain?"
31,"All right. So in terms of the going out, although going out with your friends wouldn't have to be on the weekend that something could happen during the week.",routine,101_31,T,od,,"Theek hai. Toh bahar jaane ke bare mein baat karte hain, haalaanki apne dost ke saath bahar jaane ki koi majboori nahi hai ki wo sirf weekends par ho, kabhi manpasand din bhi ho sakta hai."
32,"Yeah, absolutely. You know, a lot of my friends normally go out during the week because you know, they have their families and everything to take care of on the weekend. So, yeah, I could definitely go out tonight during the week.",routine,101_32,P,id,,"Haan, bilkul. Pata hai, bohot saare mere doston ko usually week me jaana pasand hota hai because pata hai, unke weekend mein apni families aur sab kuchh sambhaalne ko hota hai. Toh, haan, main aaj raat week me definitely ja sakti hu."
33,"Okay, so you could agree. The both of you could agree to that as kind of terms of this behavioral experiment or weekends, you'll spend those weekends together.",routine,101_33,T,id,,"ठीक है, तो तुम सहमत हो सकते हो। तुम दोनों उसके तौर पर सहमत हो सकते हो जैसे इस व्यवहार परीक्षा या वीकेंड के मामले में, तुम उन वीकेंड"
34,I think we could try that.,routine,101_34,P,ack,,मुझे लगता है कि हम उसे ट्र
35,"Because that was a concern you specifically brought up. How about Sarah, how about the times during the week? How do you feel about those?",routine,101_35,T,irq,,Kyunki vo ek chinta thi jo tumne khaas taur par uthai thi. Sarah ke baare mein kya sochti ho? Hafte ke dino ke baare mein kya khayal hai?
36,You feel like you'd respond better to that? Would that be a better experience?,routine,101_36,T,yq,,Kya tumhe aisa lagta hai ki tum us par behatar pratikriya karoge? Kya woh ek behatar anubhav hoga?
37,Something that you think that you could try next week.,routine,101_37,T,id,,Tum kuch aisa soch rahe ho jo tum agli hafte mein koshish kar sakte ho.
38,"So, let's talk about when because you've gone out before and you said it was just getting out. Getting out the house that was the, the real challenge right? So walk me through. This really goes through both of you. What we through what happens when you're when you're getting ready to leave when you're planning to head out?",routine,101_38,T,irq,,"Toh, chaliye baat karte hain jab aap pehle jaa chuke hain aur tab aapne kaha tha ki yeh sirf baahar nikalna tha. Ghar se bahar nikalna, yeh asli mushkil tha na? Toh mere saath chaliye hai. Aap dono dono main baat karte hai. Aap jaate waqt aapki kya mentality hoti hai, jab aap nikalne ke liye taiyaar hai?"
39,"So you know, usually I'll go get dressed I'll let her know where I'm going you know, give her my cell phone number you know somebody else's phone number in case my phone is off. Just basically tell her what we're going to do you know whether we're going out to to a pole or you know, going to watch some sporting event or something like that. No, I would tell her what we're doing, you know, just so she knows and knows where she can find me. But then after that, it seems like as soon as I assure her of what we're doing, and when it's happening, when I'll be home, everything like that, it just seems like all the progress I made towards the front door kind of gets pulled back a little bit because like, she doesn't want me to leave, you know, I can see in her eyes that she's not very happy about me leaving her. And that kind of makes me feel guilty, you know, because I don't want to leave her alone. I want her to be more independent. I kind of want her to, you know, if I'm going out, I would like her to go out as well. You know, she says tons of friends. You know, we both have friends. We both have our social circles. And she's kind of it's frustrating when I can't go do my thing, because she's always got to be with me.",story,101_39,P,id,,"To tum jaante ho, normal mein kapde pehenne chala jaaunga aur usse bata dunga ki main kahaan jaa raha hoon tumhe pata hai, apna phone number bhi doonga, tumhe pata hai, kisi aur ka phone number bhi doonga taki agar mera phone band hai toh. Basi usse bata doonga hum kya karne jaa rahe hain, tumhe pata hai, kahin jaane jaa rahe hain ya koi sporting event dekhne jaa rahe hain. Lekin fir uske baad, jab main use bata deta hoon hum kya karne jaa rahe hain, kab hoga, kab main ghar aaoonga, sab kuch, toh lagta hai jaise ki main jo darwaze tak progress kiya tha, woh sab peeche khinch liya jaata hai kyunki woh nahi chaahti ki main jaao, tum jaante ho, main use aankhon mein dekh sakta hoon, woh bahut khush nahi hai jab main use chhod kar jaata hoon. Aur woh mujhe thoda sa guilty feel karati hai, tum jaante ho, kyunki main use akela nahi chhodna chahta. Mujhe chahti hoon ki woh thoda sa independent ho jaaye. Main chahta hoon ki agar main bahar jaa raha hoon, toh woh bhi bahar jaa sake. Tumhe pata hai, uske bahut saare friends hain. Hum dono ka apna apna social circle hai. Aur mujhe thoda frustration hota hai jab main apne kaam ko nahi kar paata kyunki woh hamesha mere saath hona chaahati hai."
40,"So ultimately, after all that you you do go, but you feel feel guilty. And do you have a good time?",routine,101_40,T,yq,,"अत: अंततः, सब बातों के बाद जब आप जाते हो, तो आपको जाना ही होता है, लेकिन आपको दोषी महसूस होता ह"
41,"Most of the time, right? Do you know, sometimes I just can't get over the fact that you know, my wife at home who's upset at me, and that makes me upset. You know, it's just a matter of finding the balance between, you know, my independence and her, you know, doing her own thing because I would like her to do that as well.",routine,101_41,P,id,,"Aksar jyadatar, milta hai na? Tum jante ho, kabhi kabhi main yeh nahi samajh pata ki tum jante ho, ghar pe meri biwi meri baat pe naraz hai, aur yeh mujhe bhi gussa kar deti hai. Tum jante ho, yeh sirf balance ka sawaal hai, meri azadi aur uski apni marzi se kaam karne ke beech mein, kyonki main chahta hoon ki wo bhi yeh kare."
42,So sometimes you have a good time sometimes you don't. You're worried about Sarah being home. How about when you come home?,routine,101_42,T,yq,,Kabhi kabhi tumhare paas achha samay hota hai aur kabhi nahi hota. Tum Sarah ghar par hone se chinta kar rahe ho. Tum ghar aane par kaisa lagta hai?
43,"When I come home, usually things go back to normal. I mean, we've definitely had our exchange of words after a few times me coming back. But most of the time it goes back to normal, which you know, it's fine. We're very loving, affectionate couple. So that's awesome. But you know, most the time it's just overbearing.",routine,101_43,P,id,,"Jab main ghar aata hoon, toh aam taur pe sab old ho jaata hai. Main na kiya, humne kuch shabd ka pratyutpann hone ke baad, jo kuch baar main aata hoon. Lekin zyada tar woh old ho jaata hai, jo tumhe pata hai, woh theek hai. Hum bahut pyaar karne waale, priya jodi hai. Toh yeh bahut accha hai. Lekin tumhe pata hai, zyada tar woh atyant bolne waala hai."
44,"Is that how you see it Sarah, the way Frank described it?",routine,101_44,T,yq,,"Kya yeh tumhe sarah, jaise frank ne bataya hai, aisa hi dikhta hai?"
45,so how about one is out? Like so after after he's left? What do you What are you thinking that? Like?,routine,101_45,T,orq,,"Toh kya tumhe lagta hai, ki ek baar vo bahar ho gaya toh uske baad kya? Tum kya soch rahe ho uske baare mein? Kaisa lag raha hai?"
46,You're anxious something bad's gonna happen.,routine,101_46,T,id,,Tum chinta mein ho kuch bura hone waala hai.
47,"Do you think that there's been any reason for that thinking, like, do you think there's any basis for thinking something bad's gonna happen? ",routine,101_47,T,yq,,"Kya tumhe lagta hai ki us vicharo ke peechhe koi karan hai, jaise ki kya tumhe lagta hai ki kuch bura hone ki sambhavna hai?"
48,"Absolutely not. No, no, I love Sarah you know, the five years that we've worked together been great, you know, it's it's just where we are now as opposed to where we first were, and when we first got married, it's it's changed and you know, I would just like some independence just like to be on my own sometimes. And I guess I don't always relay that well to her and she doesn't understand why I want my space. I want to go hang out with my friends, but I've been trying to explain to her that, you know, it's, it's a two way street. It's not just all one way and so we have to work on these issues. And you know, that's why we came to you.",story,101_48,P,on,,"Absolutely nahi. Nahin, nahin, main Sarah se pyaar karta hun, tum jaante ho, hamne paanch saal saath kaam kiya hai, bahut achha tha, tumhe pata hai, abhi ham kahan hai aur hamari shuruat se kahan hai, aur jab hum pehli baar shaadi kiye the, uske baad se badal gaya hai aur tumhe pata hai, main bas kuchh azaad hona chahta hun, kabhi kabhi apne aap rehna chahta hun. Aur shayad main usko kabhi kabhi achhe se samjhata nahi hun aur usko nahi samajh aata hai ki main kyun apna khayal rakhna chahta hun. Main apne doston ke saath jaana chahta hun, par main usko batane ki koshish kar raha hun ki ye dono taraf ka mamla hai, sirf ek tarah se nahi. Isliye hamein in mushkilon par kaam karna hoga. Aur tum jaante ho, isiliye hum tumhare paas aaye hain."
49,"Alright, so you're really frustrated by not being able to go out, go out. But you're anxious about when he goes out. So we talked about the possibility of like an experiment or you go out sounds like we might run to the same difficulties you experienced before. What can we change to increase the chances of that experiment working?",routine,101_49,T,irq,,"Thik hai, toh tu bahot pareshan hai kyunki bahar nahi ja sakta hai, ja sakta hai. Lekin tu pareshan hai jab woh bahar jaata hai. Toh humne discuss kiya ki kya koi trial ho sakta hai ya tu bahar jaata hai jaisa taki hum wohi takleefein face na karein jinhein pehle face kiya tha. Hum kya badal sakte hai taki us experiment ke success ke chances zyada ho?"
50,"So, so if you called when he was at Piedmont The answer is that's something that's normally possible.",routine,101_50,T,id,,"So, agar tumne use Piedmont mein phone kiya tha to jawab hoga ki wo normally possible cheez hai."
51,"Yeah. Yeah. Most of the time, I'm very good at responding to, you know, making sure that she knows I'm okay. Making sure that she's okay.",symp/reasoning,101_51,P,id,,"Haan haan. Jyadatar samay, main bahut accha hoon respons karne mein, pata hai na, ye sure karne mein ki woh jaanti hai ki main theek hoon. Aur ye bhi dhyaan rakhte huye ki woh theek hai."
52,"So that's a compromise, you'd be willing to make. Absolutely something like that. ",symp/reasoning,101_52,T,yq,,"Wo ek samjhauta hai, joh tum taiyaar ho karne ke liye. Bilkul ussi tarah ka kuch hai."
53,Yeah.,inactive,101_53,P,op,,Haan.
54,"You need any other reassurances from Frank, Sarah?",routine,101_54,T,irq,,"Kya tume Frank se kuch aur tasalli chaiye, Sarah?"
55,Do you have a plan to call Frank? Like when he's out? Or is it something that you would do if you just felt the need to or,routine,101_55,T,irq,,Kya tumhare paas Frank ko call karne ka koi plan hai? Uske baahar jaane ke baad? Ya phir ye kuch aisa hai jise tum bas zarurat mehsoos karne par karti ho?
56,Were you calling for some specific reason?,routine,101_56,T,irq,,Kya koi khaas wajah se tum call kar rahe the?
57,"Why don't you start reinsurance? Everything's going right. Okay, so that seems reasonable to you. Right? I mean, I, I guess",routine,101_57,T,irq,,"Kyu tum reinSURANCE shuru nahin karte? Sab kuch sahi ho raha hai. Thik hai, toh tumhe yeh thik lag raha hai. Sahi? Mera matlab hai, main, main sochta hun"
58,"but at the same time, like when I'm out doing my own thing, you know, I kind of want that privacy in that, you know, just being in the moment you know, because I know when I get back home, from back with you and I'm, nothing's changed because I've always been with you like we're still married. But when I'm out with my friends, and you know, I'm getting a couple phone calls during you know, the night over the course of the night and it's having to deal with my wife and having to make sure that she knows I'm okay and everything like that it it gets a little frustrating. It's a little, I mean, frustrating",routine,101_58,P,id,,"Par jab bhi mein apne aap kuch kar raha hota hoon, mujhe samaa mein rehne ki khwaish hoti hai kyunki jab main waapas ghar laut kar aata hoon, tumhare saath waapas aakar bhi kuch nahi badalta, kyunki main hamesha se tumhare saath tha, hamari shaadi abhi bhi zinda hai. Lekin jab main apne doston ke saath bahar hota hoon, aur tumhe pata bhi hota hai ki raat bhar kuch phone calls aate rahenge aur mujhse baat karni hogi, tab main thoda frustrate ho jaata hoon. Thoda, matlab, thoda zyada bhi!"
59,"Would that be a good compromise? It was a text or two. I guess. That's better than a phone call, right? Yeah. So not ideal, but you can see how it might decrease your anxiety a bit. Right? And maybe work toward a little bit more freedom. So that's how I can experiment you both combined to try.",symp/reasoning,101_59,T,yq,,"Kya yeh ek achha sa samjhauta hoga? Ek-do texts the. Shayad. Ek phone call se toh behtar hai, na? Hmm. Thoda kam khwais hai, lekin dekh sakte ho kaise yeh tumhari anxiety kam kar sakti hai. Sahi hai na? Aur shayad thoda aur azaadi ke taraf ja sakte hain. Toh yeh hai ki main tum dono ko join kar ke try kar sakti hoon."
60,"Okay, so we could try and try it out.",routine,101_60,P,id,,"Theek thik hai, hum try kar sakte hain aur dekh sakte hain."
61,"Alright. So it's not a perfect plan. But it's one that you know, I would hope that we could be successful with if you could, though, you're going through it, maybe track what happens, right, from your own perspective, like what you were thinking, the fact left, what you were thinking when you left, how it went, how that separation kind of was conducted. And what happened. Same thing when, while you're out how many times you texted her If you called and then what happened when he got back? Right? That's just kind of, and you can you can keep a record of those things just independently. You know, you write it down Come your experience and you write down your experience. And we'll come back next time.

Toh yeh ek perfect yojna nahi hai. Lekin yeh ek aisi yojna hai jo aapko pata hai, mujhe ummeed hai ki hum safal ho sakte hai agar aap uspe jaaye aur dekhte hai kya hota hai, waise aapke khud ki drishti se, jaise ki aap kya soch rahe the, jab aap chale gaye, kaise guzra, kaise yeh separation hua. Aur kya hua. Waise hi jab aap bahar hai, kitni baar usse message kiya, agar call kiya toh kya hua jab wapas aaye? Theek hai? Yeh bas ek tarah se, aur aap aisa record rakhsakte hai un cheezon ka alag se. Aap likh sakte hai apni anubhav aur likh sakte hai apne anubhav. Aur agli baar firse milenge. Chahe kuch bhi ho uske saath, hum compare karenge aur dekhenge ki kya hua aur kaise hum adjustments kar sakte hai taki yeh aur bhi behter kaam kare."
62,summary,"The patients got a married one and a half years ago. They have been having trouble with their personal space, being independent and the lack of it, both. Frank has issues to do things independently as he feels pressure to be with her. It makes him feel guilty. Sarah feels rejected. The patients have experimenting hanging out separately twice and it hasn't worked out well. Frank expresses that he feels the need to assure Sarah when he is out, and Sarah feels anxious for the time when Frank is out. Sarah agrees a couple texts and a phone call when Frank is out will help. The therapist asks to note down these experiences before the next meeting of how they both feel, and it can be discussed in the next session. ",,,,,
