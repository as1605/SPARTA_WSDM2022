You asked me to come in and just, I don't want to talk to you anymore because I come in here and I talk and I talk and I talk and talk and I don't get anything out of it. You're all the same.",symp/reasoning,11_0,P,com,,"Muje tumse aur baat nahi karni hai. Tum sab ek jaise ho. Tum sab ho. Main apna samay barbad kar rahi hoon. Tum sab, tum sab ek jaise hi ho. Tum sab log bilkul waise hi ho. Tumne mujhe andar aane ko kaha aur mein yahaan aati hoon aur baat karti hoon aur baat karti hoon aur baat karti hoon aur baat karti hoon aur mujhe kuch bhi hasil nahi hota. Tum sab ek jaise ho."

2," You are all of you, all of you all therapy,",symp/reasoning,11_2,P,cd,,"Tu sab tum ho, tum sab therapy ho, sab tum hi ho therapy."
3,"Okay, I mean, I'm having a couple three reactions to what you're saying. I mean, one is that you're saying you're all the same and",inactive,11_3,T,irq,,"Okay, mujhe yeh samajh nahi aa raha hai, par main aapke bataye hue baaton par kuch behatarive hai. Yeh baat hai ki aap keh rahe hai ki aap sab ek jaise ho."
4,we're all the same. You're all the same. In the for you guys. Nothing is working. Right. Nothing is working.,symp/reasoning,11_4,P,id,,Hum sab ek hi hain. Tum sab ek jaise ho. Tumhare liye hum log. Kuch bhi kaam nahi kar raha hai. Sahi. Kuch bhi kaam nahi kar raha hai.
5,"I mean, I'm feeling just lumped in with everybody else right now. ",inactive,11_5,T,crq,,"मतलब, मुझे अभी हर किसी के साथ सम्मिलित महसूस हो रहा है।"
6,"Well, you are because you're all the same. Of course, you're lumped in with everybody. I'm not gonna single you out. Not gonna make you you know, single you out because you're not doing anything. You don't do anything. There's all this abstract metaphysical stuff and there's no concrete. This is the way to fix it. This is the goal. There's nothing so what's the point?",story,11_6,P,com,,"Tum wohi ho kyunki tum sab ek jaise ho. Bilkul, tum sabke saath rakh diya jata hai. Main tumhe alag nahi karoonga. Tumhe alag nahi karon kyonki tum kuch bhi nahi kar rahe ho. Tum kuch bhi nahi karte ho. Yeh sab kuch anishchit adhyatmik baatein hain aur koi thos baatein nahi hain. Yeh usko theek karne ka tarika hai. Yahi humara lakshya hai. Yeh kuch nahi toh phir kya fayda?"
7,"I mean, it's there's something specific right now that I could say or do that that would fill, give you what you're wanting or need.",inactive,11_7,T,cd,,"I mean, abhi kuch specific hai jo main keh sakta ya kar sakta hun jisse tumhe wo mil jayegi jo tum chahte ya zaroorat hai."
8,"How do I, how do you how do I go from point A to point B? How do I get better? How do I fix what's going on? I mean, that's the reason I came here. Right? I thought there was a reason I came here is to fix things. make things better.",story,11_8,P,orq,,"Maine aapko, aapko mujhe yeh batao ki point A se point B tak kaise jaau? Mai kaise behtar ho sakta hu? Mai joh ho raha hai use kaise theek karu? Main toh yahi soch raha tha ki yahan aane ka ek wajah yehi tha - samasyao ko theek karne ke liye aur cheezein behtar banane ke liye."
9,"So you want sort of a, like a kind of, sort of like step by step description of",inactive,11_9,T,yq,,"Toh tumhe ek tarah se, jaise ki ek kisam, ek tarah se step by step vistar chahiye, samajh mein aaya?"
10,what something I need something to grab onto something to hold something Grab onto Yeah.,symp/reasoning,11_10,P,op,,"Kya kuch hai mere paas kuch pakadne ke liye kuch chahiye, kuch pakadne ke liye kuch chahiye, Kya pakadne ke liye? Haan."
11,"Yeah. See, my sense is that you know, that you sort of desperately want something to grab on to, to get to give you some sense of hope. And, and I really want to be able to, you know, to give you something but but it feels like there's something about the kind of intensity of your, of your sort of demand or play right now. Which, which makes it difficult for me to really sort of respond in a way that's going to give you what you need. Or, you know, a better way of putting it is, you know, have a sense that the kind of thing that you want or needing or needing has to kind of come out of an organic process between the two of us and there's something about the sort of intensity of your desperation with Which makes it difficult for you to really be open and receptive to whatever I have to give",story,11_11,T,orq,,"Haan. Dekho, meri sense hai ki tum jaante ho, ki tum koi cheez ko pakadna chahte ho, kuch hope paane ke liye. Aur, main sach mein chahta hun ki main tumhe kuch de paun, par lagta hai ki tumhari itni zyada demand ya karte hue khel se, mujhe kuch bhi karne me mushkil ho rahi hai. Ki tumhe jo chahiye, usko main tumhe dena chahta hun, lekin behtar yehi hai ki hum dono ke beech ek organic process se nikle, aur tumhari baatein ki itni zyada intensity hai, jo tumhe mera saath lena bezar kar deti hai. Jiske wajah se tum khul kar mera diya hua cheez ko grahan nahi kar paate."
12,"just the way I am I always come out like that I always sway I get things. So the only way I get that's the only way I know how to be. I come out one of two ways. I come out either full, full throttle, just full, full tilt, just come out and just do it that way or I don't do anything at all. So it's like I one way and it's not good enough and on the other way and it's not good enough so ",story,11_12,P,od,,"Mai hamesha aisa hi bahar aa jata hu jaisa mai hu. Mai hamesha hilta rehta hu aur kaam karta hu. To bas mai wo tareeka hi jaanta hu. Mujhe do tariko se kaam karna aata hai. Ya to poora, poora sahara leke ya phir kuch bhi nahi karta hu. To ek taraf se nahi accha aur dusri taraf se nahi accha hai."
13,so it's like,inactive,11_13,T,ack,,So yeh woh jaise hai
14,"damned if you do damned if I do damned if I don't. If I go one way at everybody, it you know it doesn't seem to make a difference one way or the Other and then if I'm just quiet and you know, just fall in with the crowd, it doesn't matter either. So",symp/reasoning,11_14,P,com,,"Galti karne par shraap milta hai aur galti na karne par bhi shraap milta hai. Agar main sabse alag tarah se chalunga, toh kuch farak nahi padne wala hai aur agar main chup rahunga aur crowd se milkar chalunga, tab bhi koi fark nahi padega. Toh."
15,"it sounds like it feels like you only have two choices, right that you can you can either approach the situation kind of on the attack, you know with with both guns blazing. It's a good way to describe",symp/reasoning,11_15,T,orq,,"Yeh aisa lagta hai ki tumhe sirf do chunne hai, sahi hai ki tum woh ya toh thoda aggressive tareeke se samna kar sakte ho, tum samajh rahe ho, jaise kii dono bandooko ke saath baar baar. Yeh ek achha tareeka hai description karne ka."
16,it both guns blazing.,symp/reasoning,11_16,P,in,,यह दोनों हाथों से ज
17,"Right or or the alternative is to kind of go along and compromise yourself in some way. Right. Right. Have those two which, which feels better, which feels worse?",symp/reasoning,11_17,T,orq,,"Sahi ya to usko manage karo ya fir kuchh tarah se khud ko samjha kar compromise karo. Sahi hai. Sahi hai. In do mein se jo behtar lagta hai, jo behtar lagta hai?"
18,"Well, the bulk guns blazing always feels better because if I go at somebody with with, you know, full force and, you know, hit them over the head, you know, and just and just go at them. Even if they turn away, it doesn't really matter. Because I've already sent my face and so when I say, but if I don't say anything, I just sit back and don't do anything, then it just gets me as angry as the full guns blazing. So it just they eats me up, but it eats me up in here and I get even angrier than if I just blurt it all out and get it all out.",story,11_18,P,od,,"Well, sirf zor se chalne se toh acha lagega na kyunki agar main kisi ko zor zor se jake maar dun nahin toh woh waise bhi seedha ho jayega. Jitna marzi uska muh khol le, koi farak nahin padta. Kyunki maine apni asliyat toh pahle hi dikha di hai, chaahe woh ise pasand kare ya na kare. Lekin agar main kuchh na bolu, aur bas peeche baith ke kuchh na karu, toh mujhe gussa aane lagta hai, waise hi jaise zor se chalne se aata. Ye mere ko kha jata hai, lekin andar se ye mere ko aur bhi zyada gussa kar deta hai, jab main kuchh na bolu aur sab saamne bahar kar doon."
19,"Right. Yeah, I can imagine that right that right, if you end up you know, at least if you're going in there with with both guns blazing, there's a way in which you can kind of feel okay about yourself in some way, even though you're not getting your needs met. Right. But somehow they're, you know, sort of giving in, it's like you're giving away part of yourself in some way. So, I mean, you know, it seems to me that the you know, the dilemma is that you have no good way of getting your needs met right now, right. You sort of desperately need Something right, but a middle ground. There's no middle ground. Okay. So, you know, I'm not sure exactly what that middle ground is right now. But I'm willing to work with you to, you know, to really work on discovering what that middle ground is. Does that does that seem worthwhile?",inactive,11_19,T,orq,,"Sahi. Haan, main soch sakta hoon ki agar tum yaha ja rahe ho, to kam se kam yaha dono toopon ke saath ja rahe ho, to tum khud par kuch had tak theek mahsoos kar sakte ho kisi na kisi tarah, waise hi ki bhi tumhare zarooriyaan puri na ho rahi ho. Sahi. Par kisi tarah weh kam de rahe hain, jaise ki tum khud se kuch hissa haasil karna. To, mujhe lagta hai ki is dilemma ka matlab hai ki tumhare zarooriyaan abhi theek se puri nahi ho rahi, sahi. Tumhari bahut zarurat hai kisiki cheez ki, par koi middle ground nahi hai. Theek hai. Toh, abhi tum mujhe theek se nahi pata ki wo middle ground kya hai. Lekin main tumhare saath kaam karne ke liye taiyaar hoon, tumhe woh middle ground discover karne mein asist karne ke liye. Kya wo sahi lagta hai?"
20,I have to have to find a middle ground.,symp/reasoning,11_20,P,op,,Mujhe ek madhya marga khojna hai.
21,"Okay, but what are you feeling right now?",inactive,11_21,T,irq,,"Thik hai, par tum abhi kya feel kar rahe ho?"
22,"Just it bothers me. I can't go one way or the other. It's like, try to do one thing. You can't do it and try to the other way. Can't do it. Just I'm just stuck.",symp/reasoning,11_22,P,id,,"Bas itna hi mujhe pareshan karta hai. Main ek taraf nahi ja sakta. Yeh hai ki, ek chiz karne ki koshish karo. Tum nahi kar sakte aur doosri taraf se koshish karo. Nahi kar sakte. Bas mujhe atak gaya hai."
23,There's a real kind of sadness there.,inactive,11_23,T,yq,,वहाँ एक प्रकार का असली दुख है।
24,yes,inactive,11_24,P,ack,,haan
25,Look at me. The sense of what's what's going on for us? It sounds as if here. You're asking for something. Yeah.,inactive,11_25,T,orq,,Dekh lo mujhe. Samajh nahi aa raha hai ki kya chal raha hai hamare liye? Aisa lag raha hai. Tum kuch maang rahe ho. Haan.
26,I need something I can't get myself.,inactive,11_26,P,od,,Mujhe kuch chahiye jo main khud nahi pa sakta.
27,"Yeah. Yeah, I, you know, I hear that I hear the, you know, you're sort of desperation and I hear your sadness and your pain and your hopelessness. You know, when I'll do my best to help you",routine,11_27,T,gt,,"Haan. Haan, main samajhata hoon, main sunta hoon ki, aapko andaza hai, aapki bekasi aur aapki udasi aur aapki bebasi ka. Aap jante hain, main aapki madad karne ki apni seva kamiyaab karunga."
28,summary,"The patient complains that therapy does not work on them and call it a metaphysical stuff. The patient wishes to get better and needs something to hold onto. The patient feel they sway at things, and they have two options. Either to fall with the crowd by compromising themselves or go all guns blazing. The patient feels better with going all guns blazing. The patient gets angry if they don't say anything. The patient wishes to find a middle ground as they can't go one way or the other. The therapist assures to do their best to help them.",,,,,
