4,"so we have a part that wants to settle down, a part that wants to keep going with the career so For this to chair, what I like to do is in the chair where you're seated now, this will be the emotional self, in this case, the side that wants to pursue the career. Yeah, myself before that seems like we're more that's what I really want. Yes, you're more emotionally connected. That's what you want. That's what I want. So this will be the side of you, that has the needs and the wants, and more the emotion. Okay, so that's who you'll be in this chair. That makes sense. ",story,22_4,T,yq,,"So humare paas ek aisa hissa hai jo settle ho jaana chahta hai, aur ek aisa hissa hai jo career ke saath aage badhna chahta hai. Is liye iss chair ke liye, jahan pe aap abhi betha hua hai, yeh hoga aapka emotional self, iss case mein woh hissa jo career pursue karna chahta hai.

5,Yep.,inactive,22_5,P,ack,,Haan.
6," In the other chair, let's have the critic that's inside that internal critic. That's advocating for settling down for getting married for having kids. In a way it represents a societal pressure Did those two sides seem separate to you? ",story,22_6,T,yq,,"Dusre chair mein, chalo humare paas woh pariikshak ho jo us andar ke baahtrik pariikshak ke liye hai. Woh shaadi karne aur bachche paane ki liye ghabraahat ke liye awaaz uthata hai. Kisi na kisi tareeke se yeh samajik dabaav ko darshaata hai. Kya in dono paksho ko alag dikhe?"
7,Yeah.,inactive,22_7,P,ack,,Haan. (
8," You feel like you can be the emotional self here, an internal critic there?",story,22_8,T,yq,,"Tumhe yahan apne bhaavuk aap ko ho sakte ho, aur vahaa ek antarik niyantarta?"
9,I think so. Okay.,inactive,22_9,P,op,,Main sochta hu. Thik hai.
10,"So, I think you remember how this work she'll be, he'll be talking to this case the internal critic, right? So the internal critics on the side of settling down, getting married. And then when you're ready to have the critic respond, you'll switch that chair and respond to the emotional needs driven and wanting some make sense. Okay. So whenever you're ready, go ahead and speak directly to the internal critic.",story,22_10,T,irq,,"Toh, main sochta hoon ki tujhe yeh yaad hai ki kaam yeh kaise hoga, woh is case mein hamein bata raha hoga, teek hai? Toh woh case ke andar ke critics hain, jo shaadi karke settle ho jaana chahte hain. Aur phir jab tumhara critic jawaab dena ho, toh woh kursi ko badal ke aur emotional needs ko dhyaan mein rakhte hue jawaab do. Teek hai. Toh jab bhi tum tayaar ho, seedhe taur pe baat karo iss internal critic se."
11,"I want to Finish what I'm doing, and I want to finish what I started. I've worked so hard on my career path, and I'm so close to finishing. And I want to finish for me want to accomplish those goals that I've set for myself? And something I'm passionate about?",story,22_11,P,id,,"Mujhe wo karna hai jo main kar raha hoon, aur main wo pura karna chahta hoon jo maine shuru kiya hai. Main apni career path par bahut mehnat ki hai, aur main ab tak bahut kareeb pahunca hoon. Aur main khatam karna chahta hoon kyunki main khud ke liye wo lakshya paana chahta hoon? Aur kya ye wo cheez hai jisse main junoon se kaam karna chahta hoon?"
12,"So you've made your statement. Are you ready to switch? Okay, good switch. So I use the internal critic.",routine,22_12,T,irq,,"Toh aapne apna statement bana liya hai. Kya aap taiyaar ho switch karne ke liye? Theek hai, accha switch kiya. Toh main apna internal critic use karti hoon."
13,"There's always time to pursue a career, but I need to focus on what's expected of me at this time, on the best age for having kids I have a loving boyfriend who is ready and wants to get married and settle down. And you are being selfish by just following a path that you can take at any time",story,22_13,P,id,,"Hamesha samay hai apna career pursue karne ke liye, lekin mujhe iss waqt mere parivar ki umeedon par dhyan dena hai, bachche paida karne ka sabse sahi umar par main ek pyaar bhare k boyfriend se judi hoon, jo taiyar hai aur shaadi karke settle ho jana chahta hai. Aur tum selfish ho kyunki bas ek aisi raah par chal rahe ho jo tum kabhi bhi chun sakte ho."
14,"an internal critic cues in the emotional side, in this case, the career side, been selfish. And notice your posture is very linear and you're upright. I noticed you kind of put your hand down a little bit when you're talking. Try to think of the internal critics, body movements. Try to act that out a little bit. Okay.",story,22_14,T,irq,,"Ek internal critic aapke emotional part mein signal deta hai, is case mein career side mein, aap khudgarz ho. Aur dhyan do aapka posture bilkul seedha hai aur aap seedhe kade hai. Mujhe pata chala ki jab aap baat karte ho to aap apne haath ko thoda neeche rakhte ho. Koshish karo ki aap internal critics aur body movements ko yaad karo. Koshish karo unhe thoda sa depict karne ki. Thik hai."
15,"Think it's accusation. You know, I think I like I just wanted to, like tell the emotional part that it's being stupid that it's, you know, you're you're you're not acting in the best interest of everyone else. Jump at it.",story,22_15,P,id,,"Main soch raha hoon yeh toh tujhe dosh lag raha hai. Mujhe lagta hai main chahata tha, jaise maine tere dil ki baat kaha, ki yeh paagalpan hai ki tu sabke liye behtar kaam nahi kar raha hai. Us par jhatke se utar aao."
16,You're gonna jump at the emotional side?,inactive,22_16,T,yq,,Kya tum emotional pal ko pakad doge?
17,Yeah.,inactive,22_17,P,ack,,Haan.
18,"So that's the internal critic, they respond back to the term critic from the emotional side. ",routine,22_18,T,gc,,"Isliye voh hai andar ki tarkik, woh dil se jawaab dete hai tarkik shabd se."
19,"Yeah, ",routine,22_19,P,gc,,"Haan,"
20,okay. So the internal critic is just called a selfish and one of the things is a response.,inactive,22_20,T,orq,,Theek hai. Toh the internal critic ko ekdum selfish kaha jaata hai aur ek cheez hai jiska naam hai response.
21,I feel like I'm being attacked. And I don't think it's wrong to think about myself and what I am truly passionate about.,story,22_21,P,od,,मुझे ऐसा लगता है कि मुझ पर हमला हो रहा है। और मुझे लगता है कि मैं अपने बारे में और वो चीजें सोचना गलत नहीं है जो मै
22,Let me interrupt you. So your hands are pointing back toward the career emotional self. What can you do with your hands that really embody that you want to communicate to the internal critic? Is there anything else you want to do?,routine,22_22,T,crq,,मैं आपका बीच में रुकना चाहूँ। तो आपके हाथ करियर भावनात्मी आत्मा की ओर इशारा कर रहे हैं। आप अपने हाथों से क्या काम कर सकते हैं जो आपको आंतरिक निंदक को संदेश देना चाहते हैं? क्या आपको कुछ और करना है?
23,the pointing towards me to protect myself from what the critics is saying. I just want to like push that back towards critic.,symp/reasoning,22_23,P,cd,,"""Woh mujhe protect karne ke liye point kar rahe hain, jo critics bol rahe hain se. Main bas usse critic ke taraf wapas push karna chahta hoon."""
24,"So continueand have used that motion there. You're, you're pushing the internal critic away. Okay.",inactive,22_24,T,crq,,"Toh jari rakho aur us bewegung ko wahan istemaal karo. Tum, tum apne andar ke nakharhe ko door kar rahi ho. Thik hai."
25,"So I don't need I don't need to feel guilty you know, I don't need to feel selfish for wanting to follow my dreams",routine,22_25,P,cd,,"So mujhe guilty feel karne ki zaroorat nahi hai, samajh lo, mujhe khudgarz feel karne ki zaroorat nahi hai apne sapno ka peechha karne ke liye chahte hue."
26,does the internal critic have something to say back?,inactive,22_26,T,yq,,kya internal critic ko kuch kehne ke liye hai?
27,No.,inactive,22_27,P,on,,Nahi.
28,So you've you've now pushed the emotional side is pushed the critical way.,routine,22_28,T,crq,,Tumne ab apni emotions ko dabaya aur critical tarike se push kiya hai.
29,"Okay. I think the critic, the critic feels like it understands where the emotional side of me is coming from. You know, like I can recognize why it's so important, then, like why working so hard is, is worth that, you know, sense of accomplishment that's going to come with it, how it's gonna, in the long run, help provide for all these extra things that I want to like my family in the future. I can see that.",story,22_29,P,cd,,"Thik hai. Mai samajhta hu ki kriti bhi meri emotional taraf se aa rahi samajh sakta hai. Jaise pata hai mai kyu itna ahem maanta hu, phir bhi kyu kathin mehnat karna, wo pata hamesha aayega. Mai janta hu ki isse meri parivaar or mere bhavishya ke liye anek chaahiye cheezein puri hongi. Mujhe woh dikhai deta hai."
30,"Alright, so internal critic is that hands down here is the internal critic. Right? It's an internal critic less angry, less assertive,",inactive,22_30,T,irq,,"Thik hai, toh andar ki ninda wahi hai jo ki andar ki ninda hai. Thik hai? Yeh andar ki ninda kam khafa, kam thos hai."
31,"less pushy, less pushy, less pushy. Yeah, it's not. Not as critical. Truthfully, it's just I feel like the the pressure is annoying Dwayne on either either shoulders",story,22_31,P,id,,"Kam zyaada dabav nahi hai, kam zyaada dabav nahi hai, kam zyaada dabav nahi hai. Haan, yeh nahi hai. Waqi, mujhe lagta hai ki dabaav donon kandhon pe Dwayne ko pareshaan kar raha hai."
32,So the critic is more separated now maybe a little bit but also has a different outlook.,routine,22_32,T,crq,,"तो क्रिटिक अब अलग हैं, शायद थोड़ा सा लेकिन अब उनके पास एक अलग दृष्टिकोण भी है।"
33,"more quiet. It's not like always yelling at me. Because I think it I mean, sometimes it might still say something but not in like the urgency that it had before.",routine,22_33,P,cd,,"Aur zyada shaant. Yeh meri taraf hamesha chilla chilla ke nahin bolti. Kyunki main sochta hoon, kabhi kabhi toh kuchh keh sakti hai lekin usme woh jhatpati nahin rehti jo pehle hoti thi."
34,So the critic has lost some of its vigor and determination.,routine,22_34,T,yq,,"Toh, kuchh hi samay pahle, draṣṭā khud ke prabal tvaṣṭa aur nishṭhā mein se kuchh kho chukā hai."
35,"Yeah, ",inactive,22_35,P,ack,,"Haan,"
36,to move back to the emotional?,inactive,22_36,T,crq,,Emotional par wapas jaane ke liye kya karna chahiye?
37,"I feel calmer. I feel like you know, the critic is, has always been a part of me. But that part of me It's more like, you know, it's it's not as assertive. It's not as you know, intense right now it's a call. And I think that the emotional part of me was able to win the argument per se, you know, just because that's, you know, what I want.",story,22_37,P,cd,,"Mughe asar saket lag raha hai. Mujhe aisa lagta hai ki aap jaante hain, nirnayak mera ek hissa hamesha se tha. Lekin vo hissa mere liye zyada tar, jaana- pahchaana hai. Vo abhi itna prabhavshaali nahi hai, aur na hi itna zor se bol raha hai, ye ek dawa hai. Aur main sochti hoon ki meree bhavnatmak hissa nyaya vyavahaar mein jit paa raha tha, bas kyun ki vo meree icchaa hai."
38,"So at the end of this conflict, after we split into two parts here, they have this conflict is eventually a decision is a decision to pursue a career or settle down. Do you feel you gain more clarity in that decision?",story,22_38,T,irq,,"Is conflict ke ant mein, jab hum do bhagon mein bathe hain, tab jo nirnay liya jata hai, wo ant mein kisi career ko anupasthit karne ya nishita karne par itefaq karne ke lie hota hai. Kya aapko lagta hai ki aap us nirnay mein adhik spashtata prapt karte hain?"
39,"Yeah. Because I feel like I, you know, I can stay on my decision is in has, you know, has been to stay on my career path, but now I feel less guilty for doing it.",symp/reasoning,22_39,P,id,,"Haan, kyunki mujhe aisa lagta hai ki main, pata hai, main apne decision par tik sakti hun ki meri jo career path hai, lekin ab main usko karne mein kam ahsaas mtlab mehsoos kr rahe hun."
40,"So that's, that's really been your decision all along. But the internal critic was harassing you this whole time? ",routine,22_40,T,yq,,Toh voh toh sach mein tumhari puri decision thi. Lekin kya tumhare andar ka aalochnak aapko pichle samay se pareshan kar raha tha?
41,Yes.,inactive,22_41,P,ack,,Haan.
42,And today you're able to kind of shove that internal critic back a little. And allow that internal critic to see how strongly you feel with the decision you've made.,routine,22_42,T,crq,,Aur aaj tum use thoda sa peeche karke apne andar ki sunvai ko thoda sa dabba sakte ho. Aur apni andar ki sunvai ko dikhao ki tum kitna strong ehsaas rakhte ho apni liye liye kiya gayi faisal par.
43,"Yeah, that I very much",routine,22_43,P,cd,,"Haan woh mujhe bahut pasand hai, magar"
44,do you feel is helpful technique?,routine,22_44,T,yq,,Kya tumhe yeh technique se madad ka ehsaas hota hai?
45,"Yeah, I do. I, you know, I think that separating the two sides helped me realize which one felt stronger.",routine,22_45,P,ack,,"Haan, main karti hoon. Main, pata hai, mujhe lagta hai ki do taraf ko alag karne se mujhe ehsaas hua ki kaun sa zyada taqatwar hai."
46,So he was able to give you some clarity.,routine,22_46,T,yq,,इसलिए वह आपको कुछ स्पष्टता देने में समर्थ था
47,Yes.,inactive,22_47,P,ack,,Haan.
48,"Right. All right. Well, let's once reflect on what's happened here, between now and the next session, okay, Bye, guys. Kind of a lot happened. And it seems like you've gained clarity for your decision. And then we'll pick up with the next session and see how things have progressed with. See if that internal critic is still harassing you or if it kind of stays back. And if you have more peace with a decision, that's not like a plan.",routine,22_48,T,gt,,"Theek hai. Sab theek hai. Accha, chalo ab hum ek baar sochen aaj kya hua hai, ab aur agle session ke beech mein, theek hai, bye, guys. Bhot saara kuch hua hai. Lagta hai tumhari decison ke liye tumhe clarity mili hai. Aur phir agle session mein hum dekhege ki kya progress hua hai. Dekhenge ki humara internal critic ab bhi takleef pahucha raha hai ya thoda peeche rehta hai. Aur agar tumhari decision ke saath ab zyada sukoon hai, toh woh ek plan ki tarah hai."
