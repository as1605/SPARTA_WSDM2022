1,Yes. Hi.,inactive,1.0,P,gt,,Haan bhai. Hi.
2,"Hello there. My name is Dr. Beji. I'm one of the new GP in the practice. And I'm seeing you today instead of Dr. Jones, who's your usual GP?",inactive,2.0,T,gt,,"Hello there. Mera naam Dr. Beji hai. Mai ek naya GP hoon is vyavasay mein. Aur aaj mai aapko dekh rahi hoon, Dr. Jones ki jagah, jo aapke aam GP hai?"
3,"Yes, he is. Yeah. ",inactive,3.0,P,id,,"Haan, woh hai. Haan."
4,"First of all, what would you like me to call you? ",inactive,4.0,T,gt,,"Pehle se batao, tumhe kya bulaana hai?"
5,"Oh, Julie os fine. ",inactive,5.0,P,gt,,"Oh, Julie bhi thik hai."
6,"Okay. Okay. But Julie, so what is it that's bought you to see me today?",symp/reasoning,6.0,T,gt,,"Thik hai. Thik hai. Lekin Julie, toh kya woh cheez hai jo tujhe aaj mujhe dekhne layi hai?"
7,"Well, it's the same thing that I see Dr. Jones about as my heart. ",symp/reasoning,7.0,P,id,,"Well, it's the same thing jise main apne dil ke baare mein Dr. Jones se discuss karta hoon."
8,"Yeah, I understand that you've been in to see him a few times over the last few months. Would you mind if I asked you to go over again what the problem is perhaps in your own words, so that I get an understanding of it. ",symp/reasoning,8.0,T,irq,,"Haan, mujhe samajh aa gaya hai ki tumne kuch baar use dekhne ke liye gaye ho last kuch maahino me. Kya tumhe koi aitraaz hai agar main tumse poochu ki phir se kaun sa samasya hai, shayad tumhare hi alfaz me describe karo, jisse mujhe uski samajh hogi."
9,"I just I keep getting these situations where my heart starts to really, really race like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. I get chest pains. I can't catch my breath and it's making me feel funny talking to you about And so my heart starts to race. I can't get my breath and I get chest pain. I  get very afraid. I'm gonna have to die",symp/reasoning,9.0,P,id,,"Mai bas jarr se is tarah ki halat mein fas jata hun jahan mere dil tez tarike se dhadakne lagta hai, dhadak, dhadak, dhadak, dhadak, dhadak, dhadak. Mere seene mein dard hota hai. Main saans nahi le pata aur is wajah se aap se baat karte hue mujhe ajeeb lagta hai. Aur is tarah se mera dil tez tarike se dhadakne lagta hai. Main saans nahi le pata aur mere seene mein dard hota hai. Main bohot dara hua ho jata hun. Mere ko lagta hai main marne wala hun."
10,and you're feeling a little bit anxious just here with me.,symp/reasoning,10.0,T,crq,,Aur tum yaha mere saath thodi pareshan mahsoos kar rahe ho.
11,Yeah I am just talking about it. I can feel it starting to come up.,inactive,11.0,P,cd,,Haan main abhi uske baare mein hi baat kar rahi hoon. Mujhe lag raha hai ki ye shuru hone lagega.
12,Take your time. Okay. So your heart starts to race really beats really fast and you feel like you can't catch your breath.,symp/reasoning,12.0,T,crq,,Apna time le lo. Theek hai. Toh apka dil jor se dhadkne lagta hai aur aapko esa lagta hai ki aap saans nahi le pa rahe ho.
13,"Yeah, that's exactly it. Yes. Yeah.",inactive,13.0,P,ack,,"Haan, woh bilkul hi hai. Haan. Haan."
14,How long has all this been going on for Julie?,symp/reasoning,14.0,T,irq,,Julie ko yeh sab kitne samay se chal raha hai?
15,"I think it's probably about six months, basically. ",symp/reasoning,15.0,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta hai ki yeh lagbhag six months ke baare mein hai, basically."
16,Okay. And can you remember what happened to start it all off?,story,16.0,T,irq,,Theek hai. Aur kya tum yaad rakh sakte ho ki sab kuch kaise shuru hua?
17,"Well, I think we have had some problems at work. And I felt more stressed about work than I normally do. And basically, I was just trying to get into town one day on a day off and it was very hot, very funny, hot days and it just happened. My heart just started. to race and race and race and I couldn't get my breath, I was just like gasping for breath. Then I start to get chest pains and it was just awful. And I managed to sit down and call my husband and he, he came out, he actually left work to come and get me. ",story,17.0,P,id,,"Accha, main sochta hoon ki hamare kaam mein humare kuch problems aaye hain. Aur mujhe kaam ke baare mein aksar se zyada tanaav mehsoos hua hai. Aur basically, mein ek din chutti par shahar jaane ki koshish kar raha tha aur woh din bahut garm tha, bahut maja-khela garmi wale din the aur woh achanak ho gaya. Mera dil tezi se dhadakne laga aur dhadakte-dhadakte-dhadakte, main apni saans nahi le paaya, bas ghas-gas kar raha tha. Phir mere seene mein dard hone laga aur woh bohot ghatiya tha. Aur mujhe baithne ki koshish ki aur apne husband ko call kiya, aur woh, haan woh, woh uss waqt se apna kaam chhodkar mere paas aane ke liye chala gaya."
18,Right. So that sounds like quite an unpleasant experience.,inactive,18.0,T,crq,,Sahi toh woh bohot hi naa-sukhdaayak anubhav lagta hai.
19,"Its was awful It frightenining, yeah",inactive,19.0,P,cd,,"Yeh tooh bura tha, yehi hotah darrane wala, yeah."
20,"and when that was happening to Julie, when you're in the middle of town, what was it that you thought was going on? ",story,20.0,T,irq,,"Aur Julie ke saath yeh ho raha tha, jab aap shehar ke beech mein hote haina, tab aapko kya laga ki kya ho raha tha?"
21,I thought I was having a heart attack I'm so afraid that that's is what's happening.,story,21.0,P,id,,Mujhe lag raha tha ki mujhe dil ka daura pad raha hai main itna darr gaya hai ye hi ho raha hai.
22,Right Okay.,inactive,22.0,T,ack,,Thik hai thik.
23,"So you know, start to try to avoid situations where I might get like that they see ya. ",inactive,23.0,P,gc,,"Toh tu jaanta hai, shuru se koshish karna shuru karo k jahan main wo dekh saku toh aisi baat na ho jaaye."
24,So what kind of things are you finding yourself avoiding?,story,24.0,T,irq,,Toh konsi cheezon se aap khud ko bachane ki koshish kar rahe hain?
25,I can't get into town now without my husband taking me My husband has to take me to from work. And then I also thought I shouldn't do anything to put any strain on my heart at all. So I don't do much exercise or anything at the moment or other things as well,story,25.0,P,id,,Abhi main town mein ja nahi sakti mere pati ke bina Mere pati ko mujhe kaam se lana padega. Fir maine socha ki main apne dil par koi bhi dabao na dalo. Isliye main abhi bhi exercise ya kuch aur vishayon par kam nahi karti.
26,"and other things, what sort of things you are not doing?",symp/reasoning,26.0,T,irq,,"Aur dusri cheezon ke baare mein, tum kis tarah ki cheezein nahi kar rahe ho?"
27,"personal things, personal things. ",symp/reasoning,27.0,P,id,,"खुद के चीज़, ख"
28,Okay. I guess I'm wondering if you're talking about your sex life there.,symp/reasoning,28.0,T,crq,,Theek hai. Mereko lagta hai ki tu apni sex life ke baare mein baat kar raha hai.
29,Yeah.,inactive,29.0,P,ack,,Haan.
30,Right.,inactive,30.0,T,ack,,thik.
31,"Now I just feel, you know that I shouldn't do anything like that, because it just might put too much strain on me.",symp/reasoning,31.0,P,od,,"Abhi ab mujhe lagta hai, pata hai ki mujhe aisa kuch bhi nahi karna chahiye, kyunki yeh mere liye bahut bojh ban sakta hai."
32,So you're avoiding sex in case that puts your heart rate up.,symp/reasoning,32.0,T,crq,,"Tum sex se bach rahe ho, uske karan tumhara dil ki gati badhne se bachao."
33,yeah yeah,inactive,33.0,P,ack,,haan haan
34,"Okay, How's that affecting things between you and your husband?",routine,34.0,T,irq,,"Thik hai, tum dono ke beech mein yeh cheezein kaise asar kar rahi hai?"
35,"My husband's getting really fed up with it to be honest. He's been really, really kind and really supportive. But I think it's starting to affect his life quite a lot now. So he wanted me to go to the pub last week and absolutely promised that I would, because I've begun to stop wanting to go out because I'm so afraid it's gonna happen. I promised and promised him I go to the pub. And then when it came to it, I just couldn't. I just sat on the sofa and it started happening again. And then I was worried that if I went to the pub, I'd actually like get ill in the pub. And then it's really embarrassing for everybody. So just that I couldn't go in, and I think he's getting a bit To the end of his tetanus because it just seems to come out of the blue. And I've never suffered from anything like this before.",routine,35.0,P,id,,"Meri pati ko yeh kaafi pareshaan kar raha hai, sach bolun toh. Voh bohot zyada meherbaan aur saathiyana hai. Lekin mujhe lagta hai ki yeh ab uski zindagi pe kaafi asar karne laga hai. Toh usne mujhe pichhle hafte pub jaane ke liye kaha aur poori guarantee di ki main jaaungi, kyunki ab main bahar jaane se darr hone lagi hun. Maine use poori guarantee di aur pub jaane ka vaada kiya. Lekin jab vaqt aaya toh main ja nahin saki. Mai bas sofa par baithi rahi aur fir se yeh sab shuru ho gaya. Aur fir main darr gayi ki agar main pub jaungi toh mujhe pub mein bimaar ho jaayega. Aur isse sabhi ke liye bohot sharm aayegi. Toh bas main ja nahin saki, aur mujhe lagta hai ki meri shaadi ke saare guarantee khatam hone wale hain, kyunki yeh achanak se ho jaata hai. Aur mujhe pehle kabhi kisi cheez se aisa hua nahin hai."
36,It sounds like he's getting to the end of his tether because it also sounds like you're pretty fed up with the whole thing as well. Julie,routine,36.0,T,crq,,Uski lug rha hai ki vo apni tether ki seema tak pahunch rha hai kyuki ye bhi lag rha hai ki aap bhi poore maamle se khub tang aa gaye ho. Julie
37,"Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah. ",inactive,37.0,P,cd,,"Haan, bilkul. Haan, haan."
38,"So just so that I've got the story straight. This all began about six months ago. Before that, had you had anything like this? ",routine,38.0,T,crq,,"Toh bas yeh wahi maine aapko kaha tha na. Yeh saari baat koi chheh mahine pehle shuru hui thi. Us se pehle, kya aapke paas kuch aisa tha?"
39,"No, not at all. I mean, I think we had a new manager at work, I work in a bank only and then we had a new computer system put in and so it became very much stressful for all the staff not just me. And that's I can sort of see that I was in a lot more pressure and that could be affecting me.",routine,39.0,P,on,,"Nahi, bilkul nahi. Main manta hoon ki hamare kaam pe naya manager tha, main sirf ek bank mein kaam karta hoon aur phir humare paas naya computer system laga diya gaya aur is wajah se sabhi staff ke liye bahut hi stressful ho gaya, sirf main nahi. Aur is wajah se maine dekha ki mujhe bahut zyada pressure mein tha aur ye meri parinaam par asar kar sakta hai."
40,"So just to make sure I've got the right the right way around. It began six months ago, pressure at work went to town you had the first of these attacks. And then since then you've had some more and now it's kind of got to the point that you don't want to go out to don't get to town by yourself. ",routine,40.0,T,crq,,"Toh bas yeh dekhne ke liye ki main sahi tarah se samajh raha hu. Yeh shuru hui char mahine pehle, kaam ki dabawat ne tumhe zyada pareshaan kiya, tumhe pehli bar yeh hamle huye. Fir uske baad aapke yahan aur bhi hogaye aur ab haalat waise hai ke aap yahan akele jaane ke liye nahi chahte."
41,"No, I don't want to risk it to be honest. ",symp/reasoning,41.0,P,cd,,"Nahi, mujhe honestly risk nahi lena hai."
42,"You know, you don't go to the pub, not socializing like you used to and you avoiding things like exercise and things like sex and having a bit of a taking its toll on your relationship. ",symp/reasoning,42.0,T,gc,,"Tu jaanta hai, tu pub nahi jaata, pehle ki tarah socialize nahi karta aur tu exercise jaise cheezo se aur sex se bachne ki koshish karta hai aur yeh ek relationship par asar daal raha hai."
43,Yeah yeah yeah.,inactive,43.0,P,ack,,Haan haan haan.
44,"Okay. Okay. And looking at your I know, you've had an ECG, Dr. Jones, organized for you a couple of months ago. ",symp/reasoning,44.0,T,yq,,"Okay. Okay. Aur tere dekhte hue mujhe pata hai ki, tujhe kuch mahine pehle Dr. Jones ne ek ECG karwaya tha."
45,Yeah,inactive,45.0,P,ack,,Haan
46,What have you been told about the results of that?,symp/reasoning,46.0,T,irq,,Tumhe kya bataya gaya hai uske natijo ke baare mein?
47,"Well Dr. Jones said that it was okay. And there were no problems. And, you know, I did feel relief, you know, because, obviously, there's been events in my family, my dad died of one, you know, 72. So I'm thinking it must be my heart. There must be something wrong with it right now. It did feel pleased when Dr. Jones said that. But on the other hand, nothing's changed. You know, I'm still getting exactly the same problems. Nothing, you know, not getting any help with it. I just feel a bit like well, so I haven't got a bad heart according to the experts, but I'm still getting all the same symptoms you kow worse and worse.",symp/reasoning,47.0,P,id,,"Okay, Dr. Jones ne bola ki theek hai. Aur koi problem nahi thi. Aur, pata hai, mujhe raahat mehsoos hui, kyonki, mere parivar mein kuch ghatnaayein hui hain, meri dad ne bhi ek se kal chali gayi, 72 saal ki umar main. So main soch rahi thi ki shayad mera dil kharab ho gaya hai. Abhi chaiye mujhe koi problem hogi. Jab Dr. Jones ne yeh bola tab main bahut khush hui. Lekin dusri taraf, kuch nahi badla hai. Pata hai, mujhe wahi problems ho rahi hain. Kuch help nahi mil rahi hai. Mujhe bass aisa lag raha hai, ki main abhi bhi, toh chalo, mere dil main koi problem nahi hai doctors ke hisaab se, lekin main abhi bhi wahi symptoms mehsoos kar rahi hoon, aur woh bhi kharab."
48,"So even though the your GP told you there's no, there's nothing to worry about with your heart. Do you still worry that There might be something wrong with your heart?",routine,48.0,T,crq,,"Toh kya aapki GP ne bataya ki aapke dil mein koi dikkat nahi hai, phir bhi aapko dil se kuch chinta hai? Kya aapko abhi bhi dar hai ki aapke dil mein kuch gadbad ho sakti hai?"
49,I can't understand it. What do you think of Dr. Julia?,routine,49.0,P,on,,Mujhe samajh nahi aa raha hai. Dr. Julia ke baare mein aapka kya khayal hai?
50,"I think I agree with Dr. Jones. I don't think there is anything wrong with your heart. The reason I say that is that you've had an ECG, which has come back perfectly normal. And usually if there was a problem with the heart the ECG would pick something up. Also, you've got none of the risk factors really for heart disease, because you you don't smoke, your blood pressure, from what I can gather from you notes has always been fine. You're fairly young. Before this, you were pretty fit and active. And also, I know you're worried about your dad having had a heart attack, but actually, he was a lot older than you are. And so you're not really in the same risk sort of bracket as he would have been. ",symp/reasoning,50.0,T,od,,"Main hinglish Translation:

Mujhe lagta hai ki main Dr. Jones se sehmat hoon. Mujhe lagta hai ki tumhare dil mein koi problem nahi hai. Main yeh kah raha hun kyunki tumne ECG karwaya tha, jo bilkul normal nikla hai. Aur aam taur par agar dil mein koi problem hoti toh ECG mein kuch na kuch dikhta hai. Aur tumhare paas heart disease ke khatre ki koi vajah bhi nahi hai kyunki tum smoke nahi karte, tumhara blood pressure, tumhari notes se jo mujhe samajh aya hai, humesha se theek raha hai. Tumafi kam umar ho. Iske pehle, tum bahut fit aur active the. Aur haan, mujhe pata hai ki tum apne dad ki heart attack se pareshan ho, lekin woh tumse bahut se umar ke the. Aur isliye tum waise risk bracket mein nahi ho jahan woh the."
51,Right.,inactive,51.0,P,ack,,Theek hai
52,"So I don't think that there is a problem with your heart. I guess what I'm what Is weather actually, what's going on is a little bit more what Dr. Jones thought weather actually this, this might be the anxiety that's giving you a lot of these symptoms. Have you ever thought it might be that rather than a heart problem?",symp/reasoning,52.0,T,od,,"मैं नहीं सोचता कि आपके दिल में कोई समस्या होगी। मुझे लगता है कि आपके साथ होने वाली बात वास्तव में क्या है, डॉक्टर जोन्स ने यह सोचा कि मौसम क्या है, यह थोड़े से अधिक है। असल में क्या है, यह आपको बहुत सारे लक्षण दे रहा है, यह चिंता हो सकता है कि यह चिंता हो सकता है कि हृदय समस्या से अ"
53,"I think I've been thinking more recently, it could be because my friend has like panic attacks. I've discussed it with her and she said, to be honest, it just sounds like that. I've always thought it was my heart. And what I can't understand is how my brain is making my heart start racing like it is. ",symp/reasoning,53.0,P,id,,"Mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe haal hi mein zyada sochna hai, shayad mere dost ko panic attack ho gaye hain. Maine uske saath is baare mein baat ki hai aur usne kaha hai, sach kehna toh yehi lagta hai. Mujhe hamesha yeh lagra tha ki yeh mere dil ki baat hai. Aur jo main samajh nahi paa raha hoon, yeh hai ki mera dimaag kaise meri dil ki dhadkan ko badha raha hai."
54,It's right. Okay. Has anyone explained to about anxiety and panic attacks?,routine,54.0,T,irq,,Ye sahi hai. Thik hai. Kya kisi ne aapko chinta aur ghabrahat ke bare mein samjhaya hai?
55,I don't really know.,routine,55.0,P,on,,Mujhe sachmuch nahi pata.
56,"Okay, well, perhaps it would be helpful to sort of hear a little bit more about that. What we have on top of our kidneys is two little glands and they called our adrenal glands. ",routine,56.0,T,id,,"Thik hai, toh shayad yeh zaroori ho ki hum uske baare mein phir se thoda sunen. Humare kidneys ke upar humare do chote glands hote hain aur hum inhe apne adrenal glands kehte hain."
57,Right.,inactive,57.0,P,ack,,Sahi hai
58,And they produce a hormone called adrenalin. Have you heard of that?,routine,58.0,T,yq,,Aur woh adrenalin kehte hain ek hormone banate hain. Kya aapne uske baare mein suna hai?
59," Yes, I have heard of that",inactive,59.0,P,ack,,"Haan, maine uske baare mein suna hai"
60,okay. And what adrenalin does is it prepares us for situations of fight or flight? Is that a term you perhaps remember from biology at school?,routine,60.0,T,yq,,Theek hai. Aur adrenalin ka kaam hota hai ki hamari taiyari karein ladhaye ya bhaag ke liye? Kya yeh ek shabd hai jo tum biology ke school se yaad rakhte ho?
61,I do. I do. Yeah. I Do,inactive,61.0,P,ack,,Main kar le. Main Kar le. Haan. Main Kar Loon.
62,you remember what we mean by fight or flies?,routine,62.0,T,irq,,Kya tumhe yaad hai hum kya matlab karte hain ladai ya udne ke dwara?
63,"I think like, if you're in a scary situation, you fight or you run away, basically your body sort of triggers that.",routine,63.0,P,id,,"Mujhe lgta hai, agar tu ek daravni sthiti mein hai, to tu lad or bhaag jata hai, basically tera sharir usko trigger kr deta hai."
64,Yeah,inactive,64.0,T,ack,,य
65,to do it.,inactive,65.0,P,gc,,iskaao ka khambha karna.
66,"Yes, exactly. It's what's released to allow you to do the flight or fight response in the adrenaline. So when your body needs to get ready to do something, it's surges out a load of adrenaline, and the adrenaline basically gets you ready for action. ",routine,66.0,T,ack,,"Haan, bilkul. Yeh woh hain jo jaari hai ki aapko adrenaline mein - flight ya fight ka prativarjan karne diya jaaye. Toh jab aapki body ko kuch karne ke liye taiyar hona ho, tab bahut saara adrenaline nikal jaata hai aur woh aapko action ke liye taiyaar kar deta hai."
67,Right.,inactive,67.0,P,ack,,Tik hai
68,"So it does things like it puts your heart rate up, it makes your breathing speed up, you're ready to run. It can sometimes make people feel as though their mouth is dry. It can sometimes make people feel a bit lightheaded. But those are the kinds of symptoms that you can get.",symp/reasoning,68.0,T,gc,,"Iss liye yah us tarah ki cheejen karti hai jaise ki aapki dil ki dhadkan tez kar deti hai, aapki saans ki raftar ko badha deti hai, aap tayyar ho jaate ho daudne ke liye. Kabhi kabhi yah logon ko apne munh par sookha mahsoos hone ke liye bhi bana sakta hai. Isse kuch logon ko thoda sa udas mehsoos ho sakta hai. Par ye voh tarah ke lakshan hain jo aapko ho sakte hain."
69,All of those actually Okay.,inactive,69.0,P,ack,,Sab sbka kandu shi h.
70,"What often happens with people with panic is that the first time that happens the first adrenaline release Out of the blue, perhaps at times of stress, and you mentioned that there was stuff going on at work, and you're feeling a bit stressed out and you're in town, it was a bit hot. So that may have been what was behind that very first panic attack. What happens to people is that once they've had one panic attack, they go on to have more.

71,Hmm.,inactive,71.0,P,ack,,Hmm.
72,"And the reason for that is that once you've had something like that happen to you, you're kind of there thinking, Oh, will this happen again? ",symp/reasoning,72.0,T,gc,,"Aur yeh isliye hain kyun ki jab aapke saath aisa kuchh ho jaata hai, tab aap wahan hain soch rahe hain ki kya phir se yeh ho jaayega?"
73,"Is that something that you are Absolutely sure. I have started to really monitor my heart And when it starts to race, I start to get worried. And then it starts getting faster and faster So it does feel that's",symp/reasoning,73.0,P,gc,,"Kya woh kuchh hai jiske baare me aap bilkul sure ho? Maine apne dil ki gati ko haqiqat me nigrani karne shuru kar diya hai Aur jab woh tez ho jaata hai, toh mujhe fikar ho jati hai. Fir woh aur bhi tezi se badhta hai Isliye mujhe aisa lagta hai"
74,"Yeah, you describing it Exactly. Julie, that's what we call hyper vigilance. So you they're kind of keeping a bit of an eye on your heart. And for most of us, our heart rate will go up and down all through the day, but most of us don't worry about it, because we don't notice it. ",symp/reasoning,74.0,T,ack,,"Haan, tum bata rahe ho ki bilkul ve hi. Julie, hum ise hyper vigilance kehte hain. Isliye tum apne dil par nazar rakhte ho. Aur aam tor par hamare liye, hamare dil ki dhadkan din mein bhar-bhar ke badalti rehti hai, lekin hum iski fikar nahi karte, kyunki hum ise nahi mehsus karte."
75,Right.,inactive,75.0,P,ack,,Theek hai
76,"But because you've had a panic attack you they're thinking, What's my heart doing? ",symp/reasoning,76.0,T,crq,,"क्यूंकि आपको एक घबराहट आई है, इसलिए वे सोच रहे हैं, मेरे हृ"
77,Yeah.,inactive,77.0,P,ack,,Haan.

80,"Right, So you get those kinds of anxious and they're very frightening, because you're thinking, Oh, my goodness me could my heart's on that makes you even more anxious, and that causes even more adrenalin to be released. ",symp/reasoning,80.0,T,gc,,"Haan, toh tum milti ho uss tarah ke anxious se jinke bahut dar lagta hai, kyun ki tum soch rahe ho, 'Arrey! Mere liye mere dil ka itna khayal rakhna kyunki yeh tumhein aur bhi anxious bana deta hai, aur yeh aur bhi zyaada adrenaline release karata hai."
81,Right,inactive,81.0,P,ack,,Sahi
82,And that makes the symptoms even more pronounced. And then that makes you believe even more that there's something wrong with you. Does that make sense to what might be happening?,routine,82.0,T,od,,Aur yeh aap ki liye aur zyada zahir hone waale lakshan hai.

85,"Yeah, like not walking to town or anything like that anymore. ",symp/reasoning,85.0,P,crq,,"Haan, jaise koi town tak paidal nahi ja raha ya kuch aisa hi kuchh."
86,"Exactly. And whilst in the short term that sort of alleviates your symptoms, because you don't have to get panicky, what's happening is that the more you avoid doing things, the less likely you are to ever get round to finding out whether or not anything awful, really happens. ",symp/reasoning,86.0,T,ack,,"Exactly. Aur jabtak ki aap choti marzi se aapke lakshan hi thik ho jaayein, aapko ghabrane ki jaroorat nahi padti, par kya ho raha hai ki jitna aap cheezein na karein, utna hi aapke chances bhi kam ho jaate hai ki kya sach mein koi ghatna ghati hai ya nahi."
87,Right yeah.,inactive,87.0,P,ack,,Sahi haan.

90,"Well, if we all started to tackle this as if it was an anxiety problem, there are a number of approaches, we can think about tablets. And we're gonna think about other kind of talking approaches. There are pros and cons to those and side effects and things that we need to discuss. So I'm just slightly watchful of the time, we seem to be coming to the end of today's session for the appointment, but all right, well, I wonder is whether we should meet again, perhaps next week, and look again, more carefully at some of the treatment options and think together about which might suit you best. ",routine,90.0,T,id,,"अच्छा, अगर हम सभी इसे एक एंग्जाइटी समस्या के रूप में समझें, तो कई पहलू हैं। हम दवाइयों के बारे में सोच सकते हैं। और हम अन्य बोलने के तरीकों के बारे में भी सोच सकते हैं। इन दोनों के लाभ और हानियों वाले हो सकते हैं और हमें चर्चा करनी पड़ सकती है। इसलिए मैं समय की देखभाल करता हूं, लगता है कि आज के सत्र का समापन हो रहा है, लेकिन ठीक है, क्या हम अगले हफ्ते फिर मिलें, और तब अधिक ध्यान से कुछ उपचार विकल्पों को देखें और साथ में आपको कौनसा सबसे अधिक उपयुक्त लगता है, यह सोचें?"
91,Okay,inactive,91.0,P,ack,,Theek hai
92,how would that sound?,inactive,92.0,T,yq,,woh kaisa lagega?
93,"You know, that's fine. That's fine. ",inactive,93.0,P,ack,,"Tu jaanta hai na, wo thik hai. Wo thik hai."
94,Any other questions before we end this session,inactive,94.0,T,yq,,Kuch aur prashn hai k bhai hum khatam se pehle?
95,"No, I will make an appointment to see you next week",inactive,95.0,P,ack,,"Nahi, main ek afspraak banau ki aap ko agle hafte milne ke liye"
96,I'll see you next week.,inactive,96.0,T,gc,,Main agle hafte tumhe dekhunga.
97,"Okay, thank you, doctor. ",inactive,97.0,P,gt,,"Thik hai, dhanyavaad, doctor sahab."
98,Pleasure. All right.,inactive,98.0,T,gt,,Maza. Theek hai.
