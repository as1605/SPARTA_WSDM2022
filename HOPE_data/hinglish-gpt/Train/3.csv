2,I'm doing well. Thanks for asking. So you're here at the agency today to seek counseling services?,routine,3_2,T,ack,,Main theek kar raha hoon. Thanks poochne ke liye. Toh tum aaj agency par counseling services ke liye aaye ho?
3,Yeah. My boss sent me over.,routine,3_3,P,ack,,Haan. Mera boss mujhe bhej diya.
4,"your boss said, Sure?",routine,3_4,T,crq,,"Tumhara boss bola, Sure?"
5,"There was this issue with a couple of the people that couldn't relate to my ideas and my boss solid has been kind of, you know, not working super well. So she wanted me to come over and talk about",symp/reasoning,3_5,P,cd,,"Ek issue tha do kuch logon ke saath, jo meri ideas ko samajh nahi paa rahe the aur mera boss solid hai, thoda kaam nahi kar raha tha. Is liye woh chahti thi ki main aa kar baat karoon."
6,she wants you to come over and talk about your relationship with your coworkers?,symp/reasoning,3_6,T,irq,,Vo woh tumse milne ke liye chahti hai aur tumhare saath apne coworkers ke baare mein baat karna chahti hai?
7,"Um, I think more just so that, you know, my ideas were just kind of higher than what they could really Understand, so maybe learn how to like how to talk to other people so that they can understand me.",symp/reasoning,3_7,P,id,,"Arre, mujhe lagta hai ki jyada se jyada, aapko mere vichaar unse alag hain jo woh samajh sakte hain, isliye shayad mujhe doosron se baat karne ka tarika seekhna chahiye taki ve mujhe samajh sakte hain."
8,"Okay, what would you mean by higher, like, your ideas",symp/reasoning,3_8,T,crq,,"Accha, aap higher ka kya matlab kar rahe ho, jaise, tumhare ideas"
9,"are higher, you know, just a little bit more intelligent, you know, I'm just at a level that other people can't always reach to, you just, you know, like just a little bit higher, sometimes a lot higher, but just on this team, they just couldn't understand, you know, my language or what I was saying, and it couldn't see the vision that I had.",symp/reasoning,3_9,P,cd,,"Meri intelligence thodi jyada hai, aap jaante hai, bas thodi si aur zyada, aap jaante hai, main bas ek level par hu jo ki mere colleagues ko hamesha haasil nahi ho paata hai, aap jaante hai, bas thodi si upper, kabhi kabhi kaafi jyada, par bas is team mein, wo mujhe samajh nahi pa rahe the, aap jaante hai, meri language ya jo main keh raha tha, aur wo mere vision ko nahi dikha paaye."
10,"Okay, so they were unable to reach your level of expression for this was like a project you're working on? And your boss recognized this difference, and thought that, that the counselor may be helpful. Yeah?",inactive,3_10,T,irq,,"Okay, toh woh tumhare yeh project jaisa job kar rahe the na iske liye tum kitne kaabil nahi the tumhara boss ne yahi anumaan kiya aur socha ki counselor helpful ho sakta ho. Haan?"
11,"Yeah. Yeah. Um, I think it's good, you know, so that my boss is happy that I went, but I think it could also be useful in the sense of, you know, other people are jealous of me a lot, and they just can't really relate to me. So it might be, you know, great to learn how to relate, you know, like, kind of understand what they're going through at their level.",symp/reasoning,3_11,P,id,,"Haan. Haan. Um, mujhe lagta hai ki ye accha hai, pata hai, meri boss ko khushi hogi ki main gaya, lekin mujhe lagta hai ki yeh bhi kaam ka ho sakta hai, you know, dusre log mujhse bahut jalan karte hain, aur woh mujhse relate nahi kar paate hain. Isliye shayad, achi baat hogi hum seekh sakein, you know, samajh sakein unka situation aur unke level par kya guzar raha hai."
12,"Again, you stay at their level. So are you meaning again, that they're kind of below you with skills?",symp/reasoning,3_12,T,crq,,"Fir se, aap unki level par rehte hain. Kya fir se aapka matlab hai ki woh aap se kuch kam hain hoshiyari mein?"
13,"yeah, they're just they haven't they haven't accomplished as much they have, you know, they don't know as many people, they're not hanging out with those prestigious ranks, you know, they haven't been educated to the quality that I have been. So they just sometimes it's hard for them to understand where I'm coming from, or you know, what I can see happening.",symp/reasoning,3_13,P,cd,,"Haan, woh woh hain, par woh itna bada kaam nahi kar paaye, pata hai, woh mere jaise zyada logon ko nahi jaante, woh un unchi darje wale logon ke saath ghumte nahi hain, pata hai, unhe meri tarah acchi tarah se padhayi nahi mili hai. Isliye kabhi kabhi unko samajhne mein thoda mushkil hota hai, ya pata hai, woh jo mujhe ho raha hai woh samajhne mein unko mushkil hota hai."
14,"Okay, so counseling can help you bridge that gap to go to communicate more effectively.",symp/reasoning,3_14,T,gc,,"Thik hai, toh counseling se apko madad mil sakti hai, us gap ko bridge karne ke liye taki aap communicate karne mein zyada asafal na ho."
15,"Yeah, so I think you know, so I can even better you know, I'm here but I want to be like here.",inactive,3_15,P,gc,,"Yeah, so I think you know, so I can even better you know, I'm here but I want to be like here.

Haan, toh mujhe lagta hai ki tu jaanta hai, toh main tujhe aur behtar kar sakta hu, main yahaan hu par mujhe yahaan jaise hona hai."
16,"When you say you're here at the first level,",inactive,3_16,T,gc,,"Jab tum kahte ho ki tum yahaan pe pehle level pe ho,"
17,"maybe like a seven but I want to like blow it out. The park, you know, like if 10 is here, I want to be higher than that. ",story,3_17,P,gc,,"Maybe yeh toh saat ka bhi ho sakta hai par main chaahta hun isse uuncha kar doon. Park, tum jante ho, agar 10 yahaan hai toh main usse uuncha hona chahta hun."
18,How would you plan on accomplishing that?,routine,3_18,T,irq,,Tum uss kaam ko kaise pura karne ka irada rakhte ho?
19,"Well, you know, I'm always getting recruited for these really prestigious classes and to speak places and people are always calling I'm a really large social media presence when people are constantly asking me for advice, you know, just about everything, because, you know, I've just accomplished so much that I can really help people because I just, you know, I've just been really lucky to just be good at so many things.",symp/reasoning,3_19,P,id,,"Accha hai na, you know, I'm always getting recruited for these vaise hi prestigious classes and to bol lena at places and log hamesha bolte hai that I'm a really large khaas social media presence when people are continuously mujhe advice dena chahte hai, you know, just about everything, kyunki, you know, I've just accomplished bahut saare kaam and I can really help people kyunki I'm just, you know, bahut lucky that I'm good at so many things."
20,"Okay, so it sounds like you're you have a lot of stress.",symp/reasoning,3_20,T,yq,,"Theek hai, toh lagta hai tumhe kaafi stress hai."
21,"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,3_21,P,ack,,"जी हाँ, ज"
22,"And maybe, from your understanding that people were just getting jealous because you seem to succeed in so many things.",symp/reasoning,3_22,T,orq,,"Aur shayad, tumhara samajhne se log jalan ho rahe the kyunki tum bohot se kaam mein kamyaab dikh rahe the."
23,"Yeah. You know, like, sometimes people just, it's hard to admit that you're just not as good or like you can't do it. Maybe you don't want to admit that I think I make them uncomfortable because I can.",story,3_23,P,od,,"Yeah. Tu hai na, like bohot baar log just, admit karna mushkil hota hai ki tu kuch khaas ni hai ya tu nhi kar skta. Shayad tu admit hi ni karna chahta ki maine naamard bana diya kyuki main aisa kar skta hun."
24,"So calcium help you to relate to them in a way that so how would they have a more productive way? How would they describe you? You know, given this level of difference on this, you're talking about how would they describe you, if I were to ask them, if I could ask them. Could you describe sample?",symp/reasoning,3_24,T,irq,,"Kya calcium tumhen unse judne mein madad karta hai kisi tarah se? Woh tumhen kaise bayan karenge? Tum jaante ho, is level ki farq par, tum kaise bayan karenge, agar main unse poochun, agar mujhe poochne ki ijazat mil jaaye. Kya tum sample ko bayan kar sakte ho?"
25,"Would they say? I think they would say that I have a lot of people that look up to me that I'm excellent at my job that, you know, like, I should really be vice Vice President, if not president, but I mean, I don't own the company. But I should really have a more significant position. that a lot of the presentations that are happening that I could probably do, but they don't want to, you know, other people need opportunities, but it would, it would be clear for everyone if I just did them.",story,3_25,P,id,,"Kya woh kehte? Mujhe lagta hai woh kehte ki mere bahut se log hain jo mujhe dekhte hain aur mere kaam mein shandar hain, aap jaante hain, jaise ki, mujhe sach mein up-Vice President banna chahiye, agar na president toh, lekin main company ka malik nahi hoon. Lekin main kisi aur se bhi badi position honi chahiye thi. Bahut si presentations ho rahi hai jisme main kar sakti thi, lekin woh nahi chahte, aap jaante hain, dusre logon ko mauka milna chahiye, lekin sab ke liye saaf hoga agar main hi karungi."
26,Would It be easier?,routine,3_26,T,yq,,Kya yeh aasaan hoga?
27,"Yeah, you know, easier, better, more people. It would just be it would be a great presentation if I did it. So we'll just cut away all the other stuff.",story,3_27,P,ack,,"Haan, tum jante ho, asaan, behtar, zyaada log. Bas yeh ho jayega ki agar main karta toh yeh ek badiya presentation hoti. Toh hum woh sab chhodo denge."
28,All those stuff. That's what your coworkers would include?,symp/reasoning,3_28,T,yq,,Wo sab cheezon ki needh hai. Wohi hai joh aapke coworker shamil kareinge?
29,"Yeah,",inactive,3_29,P,ack,,"Haan,"
30,yeah. Things that maybe detract from them.,routine,3_30,T,gc,,haan. Cheezein jo unka nuksaan kar sakti hain.
31,"Right. Like if you know, if I was doing the sales pitches, we could blow it out of the park. I mean, we'd be multimillionaires by now. So You know, it would get rid of all that, you know, the grunt work type of stuff, if I just did it myself,",story,3_31,P,id,,"Right. Agar tum jante ho, agar main sales pitches kar raha hota, hum phatisaar dete. Main matlab, ham ab tak arabs ke karodpati hote. Toh tum jante ho, yeh sab se chutkara pa lenge, sab us ghade kaam se, agar main khud hi kar leta."
32,does it frustrates you that you're not calling for every task?,symp/reasoning,3_32,T,irq,,kyaa tumko pareshaan karta hai ki tum har kaam ke liye nahi bulaa rahe ho?
33,"You're not recognized sometimes, but I've gotten really good at reminding people that they shouldn't be calling on me for every task. Because I'm, you know, sometimes you just have to show them, you know, I'm better than that person, or I could do it better. And I'm really good at that type of communication. So I've been able to secure a lot of positions that weren't given to me at first, because they realize like, Oh, she's better at it. So they can see your talent. ",symp/reasoning,3_33,P,id,,"Aap kabhi-kabhi pehchan nahi pate ho, lekin main bohot ache ho gayi hun logon ko yaad dilaane mein ki mujhe har kaam ke liye nahi bulana chahiye. Kyunki main, pata hai, kabhi-kabhi karna hi padta hai, dikhana hota hai, ki main uss insaan se behtar hoon, ya main wo kaam behtar kar sakti hun. Aur main iss tarah ke behtareen communication mein bohot ache hun. Isliye maine pehle se mujhe nahi diye gaye kaafi zyada achhe jagah obtain kar li usse, kyunki unhe pata chala ki, Oh, wo usse achhi hai. Isliye wo tumhara talent dekh sakte hai."
34,So they recognize you most of the time.,symp/reasoning,3_34,T,crq,,Isliye woh tumhe zyadatar pehchaante hain.
35,No I mean most of the time. Yeah,inactive,3_35,P,cd,,Nahi main matalab sabse adhik samay me. Haan.
36,How long have you been with this particular employer?,routine,3_36,T,irq,,Tum kitne samay se is khas employer ke saath ho?
37,"Um, maybe like six months, six months, maybe? Eight months. Okay.",routine,3_37,P,id,,"Hm, shayad kuch six mahine, six mahine, shayad? Eight mahine. Theek hai."
38,Can you tell me about the job you've had prior like what happened there?,routine,3_38,T,irq,,"क्या आप मुझे अपनी पिछली नौकरी के बारे में बता सकते हो, जैसे कि वहां क्या हु"
39,"an AI algorithm. They, so I got it, I got it to a really, you know, large leadership position. And then, you know, the other VP couldn't really see, see what I was going for. She couldn't relate to me and she, you know, she, she wasn't from the same type of like collegiate backgrounds that was kind of an issue. So I just outgrew what they had to offer. And then this company came in and made this tremendous offer with the you know, it was just, it was just fantastic. So I just had to make a move that was more strategic for me. And you know, that I could that I could even reach more. You know, I didn't I didn't want to be satisfied there.",story,3_39,P,id,,"Ek AI algorithm tha. Toh maine sab samjh liya, maine ek badi leadership position tak pahunch gaya. Fir, dusre VP ko mere iraade ka pata nahi chal paya. Woh mujhse relate nahi kar paayi aur uski bhi agarwadi tarah se jude hue academic background ki wajah se issue tha. Isliye maine unke pesh kiye jaane wale sab kuchh se baahar nikal gaya. Fir ek company aayi aur mujhe ek badiya offer diya hai. Woh kafi achha tha. Toh main wahan se alag hokar apne liye ek strategic move liya. Aur ab main aur bhi zyada tarakki kar sakta hu. Woh ek vaastavik deal thi. Isiliye main wahan par khush rehna nahi chahta tha."
40,You want to you want to shoot higher. You want to accomplish something greater?,symp/reasoning,3_40,T,yq,,Tum chahte ho ki tum uchcha sikhar par jaao. Kya tum kuch mahattvapoorn karne ki ichcha rakhte ho?
41,Yeah.,inactive,3_41,P,ack,,Haan.
42,more. So more stuff. You've already achieved some level of popularity.,symp/reasoning,3_42,T,yq,,Aur zyada. Toh aur zyada cheezein. Tumne pehle se kuch prasiddhi haasil kar li hai.
43,Yeah.,inactive,3_43,P,ack,,Haan.
44,"Alright, so your last ploy or the one before the place you work now, you just outgrew that. Can you tell me how that interaction went? Like? Did you quit? Or did they encourage you to leave? Like, what happened to kind of the last moments of that job?",symp/reasoning,3_44,T,irq,,"अलाइट, तो आपकी अंतिम चाल या जहां आप अभी काम करते हैं, वह आप ने ठीक किया। आप मुझे बता सकते हो कि उस मैत्रिकता में क्या हुआ? वैसे क्या आपने छोड़ दिया? या क्या वे आपको जाने को प्रोत्साहित किया? वैसे, उस नौकरी के आखिरी पलों में क्या हुआ?"
45,"Um, well, I mean,",inactive,3_45,P,gc,,"Aare, chalo, mera matlab hai,"
46,So you initiate it and you quit. At the same time. They had a few issues with type issues they have.,symp/reasoning,3_46,T,,,Itna shuru karte ho aur tum chhod dete ho. Ek sath. Unhe type ki samasyaon se kuch pareshani thi jo unke paas hai.
47,"They just said I you know, I talked too much or something like that, or I think there was an issue with somebody I was working with or something. But it was really it was another situation that just didn't. We just we weren't, we weren't communicating well, but in the end I had to do what was best for me. So because afterwards they were calling me and trying to get me back, but I was already here so that I wasn't gonna go back there.",symp/reasoning,3_47,P,id,,"Ussne do baatein hai, mujhe pata hai ki main bahut zyada baat karta hoon ya kuch aisa hua, ya main sochta hoon ki kisi ke saath mujhe kaam karne mein koi problem thi. Par sach mein woh ek aur situation thi jo kaafi achhi nahi thi. Hum theek se communicate nahi kar rahe the, par maine apne liye jo behtar tha, wo kiya. Isiliye baad mein woh mujhe phone karke wapas bulane ki koshish kar rahe the, par main pehle se hi yahan par tha, toh main vahan wapas nahi jaa raha tha."
48,So I have to quit the pursuit you to come,symp/reasoning,3_48,T,,,"Aso mai talna padenga, tere aane pe tujhe chhodna hoga."
49,yet for them again. Yeah. Which I told them was gonna happen.,inactive,3_49,P,,,Parantu is baar fir se ki wo keh diya tha ki yeh honewala hai.
50,You predicted that when you left,inactive,3_50,T,irq,,Tumne predict kiya tha ki jab tum chale gaye
51,"Yeah, it was like you're gonna you're gonna miss me cuz I'm the reason this company is flourishing.",story,3_51,P,id,,"Haan, yeh toh tha ki tu mujhe miss karne wala hai kyunki main hi hai jiski wajah se yeh company safal ho rahi hai."
52,So what did you tell them when they offered you,story,3_52,T,irq,,Tumne unko kya bola jab unhone tumhe offer kiya tha?
53,the chargeback that I was had gotten a phenomenal job and it was way better and that they lost it and they could just deal with it.,story,3_53,P,id,,Mujhe jo chargeback mila tha usne ek shaandaar naukri di thi aur wo bahut behtar thi lekin unhone uski haar kar di aur ab wo usse apne aap hi sambhal le.
54,"So you rejected them at that point, okay.",story,3_54,T,crq,,"Toh tumne unhe uss point pe reject kar diya, thik hai."
55,"Yeah. And I, you know, I want to make my boss happy, but I feel like it would be good. You know, I don't want to make people feel bad because they're inferior to me. And because they're not as successful. So if I could learn how to even talk with them so that I'm not, you know, so they don't feel bad about themselves.",story,3_55,P,cd,,"Haan bhai. Aur main, tu jaanta hai na, main apne boss ko khush rakhna chahta hu, lekin mujhe lagta hai ye accha hoga. Tu jaanta hai na, main logon ko bura nahi lagana chahta kyunki woh mere se kamzor hai. Aur kyunki woh itne safal nahi hai. To agar main unke saath baat karne seekh sakta hu to taki woh khud par buri tarah se na guzre."
56,"It's your boss putting, I mean, she encouraged you to come here today. Is she putting any pressure on you? Like, is this something that's strongly encouraged mandatory?",story,3_56,T,id,,"Arey bhaiya, your boss toh chala rahi hai yahan, matlab, wo aapko encourage karti hai aaj yahan aane ke liye. Kya wo koi dabav daal rahi hai aap par? Jaise, kya ye kuch aisa hai jo bahut zor se encourage kia jata hai compulsary?"
57,I think it's strongly encouraged. I think she has a promotion for me in mind. So it's probably just to set me up for that.,inactive,3_57,P,od,,Mujhe lagta hai ki isse majbooran encourage kiya jaa raha hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki usne mere liye ek promotion ki planning ki hai. Isliye yeh shayad sirf mujhe uske liye tayyar karna hai.
58,"So she's trying to help you for the future. Another advancement. So Sam, I'm going to get you on the calendar is to see a counselor open later this week. Is that work for you? okay? That does. So I'll get you set up for that. I really appreciate you taking the time with me it was helpful origin to see a counselor and we'll go from there. ",routine,3_58,T,yq,,"Toh voh teri madad karne ki koshish kar rahi hai, taki aane waale mein teri madad kar sake. Ek aur sudhar. Toh Sam, main tujhe kal ke baad khula counselor ke paas jaane ke liye taaiyaar kar doonga. Kya yeh theek hai tere liye? thik hai? Aisa hi karna hoga. Main tujhe uske liye set up kar doonga. Main tumhari mere saath vyateet waqt ka bahut shukriya karta hoon, yeh mujhe kaafi madadgaar laga aur hum wahaan se aage badhenge."
59,Yeah. Sure. Thank you,inactive,3_59,P,ack,,Haan. Zaroor. Shukriya.
