0,"Okay, Charles, let's take a look at your homework from last week the activity schedule.",symp/reasoning,78_0,T,id,,"अच्छा, चार्ल्स, हम आपके पिछले हफ्ते के होमवर्क को देखें। उस गतिविधि"
1,Not very much on it.,symp/reasoning,78_1,P,id,,bahut kam hai yaar.
2,"I'll take a look at it and see, well, you did complete most of it.",symp/reasoning,78_2,T,id,,"Main dekhe lunga aur dekhenge...uhh, tune jyada se jyada kar liya hai."
3,"I don't see the point. And I mean, how do you master watching TV or eating a meal? I, if I had tried to use chopsticks, I suppose it would have some mastery involved in but I, I didn't mess with chopsticks, okay. Food was okay. Hmm. But not, not great. Okay.",story,78_3,P,id,,"Mujhe point nahi dikhta. Aur main yeh keh raha hu, TV dekhna ya khana khane ko kaise sikhoge? Maine agar chopsticks istemaal karne ki koshish ki hoti, toh shayad woh sikhne mein kuch mehnat hogi, par maine chopsticks se khana nahi khaya, samjhe. Khana sahi tha. Hmmm. Lekin na hi kamaal ka, aur na hi bahut bura. Theek hai."
4,"So it was tough. And I just want to be clear, though, Charles that this is very typical though for many people that we work with. It's very difficult to complete homework worksheets, because things happen, right? I don't feel that Well, sometimes things get in the way. There's things that just prevent me from doing that. So I think our job together is to try to figure out what are the sort of barriers that make these sort of things difficult. So what would you say what would be some barriers that made it difficult to Your mastery ratings.",routine,78_4,T,id,,"Toh yeh bahut muskil tha. Aur main yeh saaf karna chahata hu ki Charles, yeh bahut aam baat hai jo bahut se logon ke saath hoti hai jinse hum kaam karte hain. Bahut mushkil hai homework worksheets complete karna, kyunki kuch cheezein aati hai, sahi? Main yeh feel nahi karta ki, kabhi kabhi cheezein raaste mein aati hai. Woh cheezein hai jo mujhe usse rokne se rok deti hai. Toh main sochta hu ki hamara saath saath kaam yeh hai ki hum dhoondhe ki kis tarah ke barriers hai jo in cheezon ko mushkil bana dete hai. Toh aap kya kehna chahenge, aapke kya barriers hai jo aapke mastery ratings ko mushkil bana dete hai."
5,"I don't enjoy anything. And I used to I used to enjoy it a lot of things. But I don't even I don't look forward to breakfast, particularly cup of coffee. The news is mostly bad and what if there is news? I mean, the paper doesn't carry much national news anymore. So, I mean, I have to eat, but I really don't see the point of a lot of things.",story,78_5,P,id,,"Mujhe kuch bhi maza nahi aata. Aur pehle mujhe bahut si cheezein pasand thi. Lekin ab mujhe ghante ki nahi, subah ka nashta karne ka bhi man nahi karta, bilkul coffee bhi. News mostly bad hi hoti hai aur agar kuch hai bhi toh? Mera matlab, newspaper ab zyada national news nahi carry karta hai. Toh, mujhe toh khana hi padega, lekin bahut si cheezon ka koi fayda nahi hai mere liye."
6,"Okay. Okay. Well, I think something that will be useful for both of us, Charles is to collaboratively work together and figure out how we can look at the perceived benefit of doing some of these things. versus the cons. So there's a worksheet that I have called a decisional balance worksheet. And it basically takes two separate decisions. One decision is to engage in activities, and there's some benefit to doing that. And then another decision would be to not engage in activities. There's benefit to that. But there's also cost to both of those decisions. So I think one objective way for you to look at this worksheet would be to determine what are the sort of things you could do and determine whether there's more benefit or cost to completing that? What do you think about that?",story,78_6,T,id,,"Thik hai. Thik hai. Theek hai, mujhe lagta hai ki hum donon ke liye kuch faydemand hoga, Charles, agar hum saath milkar kaam karenge aur ye dekhenge ki hum kuch cheezein karne ka kya labh ho sakta hai. aur nuksaan. To mere paas ek worksheet hai, ek faisli santulan worksheet, jisko maine do alag faisle ke liye bulaya hai. Ek faisla to activities mein shamil hone ka hai, aur usmein kuch fayda hai. Aur phir doosra faisla hai ki activities mein shamil na ho, aur usmein bhi fayda hai. Lekin dono faislon ke liye bhi kharch hai. To mere khayal se yeh worksheet ko dekh kar aap ek tarah se decide kar sakte hain ki aap kya kar sakte hain aur dekh sakte hain ki iska kitna zyada fayda ya kharch hai? Iske baare mein aapko kya lagta hai?"
7,"Well, that would depend on the activity. I know but okay. I could, I could get in touch with somebody I could call a friend. Maybe try to meet somebody for lunch.",routine,78_7,P,id,,"Thik hai, ye baat activity par nirbhar karegi. Pata hai par koi baat nahi. Main kar sakti hu, main kisi ko friend keh sakti hu. Shayad kisi ke saath lunch karne ki koshish karu."
8,"Okay, that's a great idea. So what would be a benefit of calling a friend or meeting someone for lunch?",symp/reasoning,78_8,T,irq,,"Thik thik hai, yeh bahut acchi idea hai. Toh kya dost ko call karne ya kisi se lunch karne ka kya faayda hoga?"
9,"Well, I would, I would enjoy the company. Okay, and wouldn't be as lonely I suppose.",symp/reasoning,78_9,P,id,,"Achcha, main karunga, main company ka aanand lunga. Thik hai, aur akela bhi na hounga shayad."
10,"Okay, that sounds great. So sounds like one benefit would be you'd enjoy the company. Yeah. And you wouldn't be as lonely. So I'd write that down. Okay, good.",routine,78_10,T,ack,,"Okay, ye toh bahut accha lag raha hai. Toh lagta hai ek fayda hoga ki aapko company ka maza aayega. Haan. Aur aap akela bhi nahi mehsus karenge. Toh main ye note kar leta hoon. Achcha, theek hai."
11,"Company company and said not as lonely not only. That's good, okay.",routine,78_11,P,id,,"Company Ne Company Bola aur kaha ke sirf akela honewala nahi hai. Wo accha hai, thik hai."
12,"Okay, can you think of the downside to potentially doing that?",routine,78_12,T,irq,,"Okay, kya tum imagine kar sakte ho ki usko karna se nuksaan kya ho sakta hai?"
13,"Well, one downside might be that he wouldn't be interested in having lunch with me. I haven't been a whole lot of fun lately. And, or he might be busy and might not not might not be able to have lunch.",story,78_13,P,id,,एक नुकसान हो सकता है कि वह मुझे के साथ दोपहर का भोजन करने में दिलचस्पी नहीं रखेगा। मैं हाल के कुछ समय से काफी रोमांचक नहीं हो। और वह या तो व्यस्त हो सकता है और शायद कि वह दोपहर का भोजन न कर पाए
14,"Okay, or",inactive,78_14,T,ack,,"Teek hai, ya fir"
15,he might want to talk about what's going on in my life and I'm ready We don't want to talk about that let somebody talk about it with you course. Okay.,story,78_15,P,id,,Usko meri zindagi mein jo ho raha hai uske baare mein baat karna hai aur main taiyar hun. Hum nahi chahte hai ki uske baare mein baat kare koi aur aapke saath uske baare mein baat kare. Theek hai.
16,So it sounds like the most practical one of those would be that he may be busy.,routine,78_16,T,id,,Toh aisa lag raha hai ki usme se sabse kaam ka hai yeh ki woh shayad busy ho.
17,Right? That could be the downside. Is that right? Okay. might not be able to come. Sure.,routine,78_17,P,yq,,Sahi toh? Voh nuksaan ho sakta hai. Kya voh sahi hai? Thik hai. Aa pao na. Pakka.
18,"Okay. So I'd write that is a great job Charles with the top two boxes with the first decision. So let's move to the second decision, which would be to stay the same and there's some benefit to that and there's some cost to that as well. Sure. Okay, Charles, so we completed the worksheet. So what's your overall impression about the benefits of changing versus the cons and staying the same?",routine,78_18,T,id,,"Ok. So, main likhega ki Charles, yeh bahut achha kaam kiya hai top do boxes ke saath pehle faisla ke saath. Toh chalo doosra faisla par chalte hain, jo rahaan hai wahi rehne dena aur usme kuch faayda hai lekin usme kuch nuksaan bhi hai. Theek hai. Charles, toh humne worksheet puri kar li hai. Toh tere overall impression kya hai changing karne ke faayde aur cons se rahne ke faaydo ke baare mein?"
19,"Well, it makes sure that the, the benefits outweigh the cons. If, if I make the change if I don't make the change I'll be doing just what I've been doing and I'll be getting up wondering, what's the point? And well still be lonely. And",symp/reasoning,78_19,P,id,,"Accha, yeh yakeen dilaata hai ki the, the fayde nuksaan se jyaada hai. Agar, agar main badlaav karta hoon toh main karunga wahi jo main pehle se kar raha tha aur main uthkar sochunga, yeh karna ka matlab kya hai? Aur phir bhi tanha rahenge. Aur"
20,"Those are good observations, Charles. So, which activity doesn't make the most sense to try for homework this week?",routine,78_20,T,yq,,"Woh acchi observations hai, Charles. Toh, is hafte homework ke liye kaun sa activity sabse zyada theek nahi lag raha hai?"
21,"Well, I call somebody I think, Okay.",routine,78_21,P,ack,,"Mujhe lagta hai ki main kisi ko call karta hoon, thik hai."
22,"Okay, that's a good observation. So, let's say for homework, then you tried to call someone to get together with a friend. And how about also trying to complete a full day of the activity schedule, and completing both the mastery and the pleasure ratings? What do you think about that?",symp/reasoning,78_22,T,orq,,"Thik hai, yeh ek acchi observation hai. Toh, homework ke liye, tumne kisi ko call kiya tha ek dost ke saath milne ke liye. Aur kya tum poora din ka activity schedule bhi complete karne ki koshish karoge, aur dono, mastery aur pleasure ratings bhi complete karoge? Tumhe kya lagta hai iske bare mein?"
23,Sure. Okay.,routine,78_23,P,od,,Theek hai. Accha.
24,"Okay. And if it gets Difficult, which again, that's pretty normal for that to take place. If it gets hard, we can talk about it next time and we can problem solve together and figure out how to remove those barriers. Does that sound good?",routine,78_24,T,yq,,"""Theek hai. Aur agar yeh mushkil hone lage, toh woh samanya hai ki aisa ho jaata hai. Agar yeh mushkil ho jaaye, hum agli baar uske baare mein baat kar sakte hai aur saath mein mushkilaat ka hal nikal sakte hai. Kya yeh sunaai de raha hai?"""
25,"Sure. Okay, okay.",inactive,78_25,P,op,,"Haan, Thik hai, Thik hai."
