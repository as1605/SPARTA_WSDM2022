1,Good.,inactive,8_1,P,gt,,Acha hai.
2,What's been going on?,inactive,8_2,T,irq,,Kya chal raha hai?
3,Been a little anxious about a shopping habit that I have,symp/reasoning,8_3,P,id,,Thoda si pareshan hokar main apni ek shopping aadat ke bare me hoon.
4,talk about that?,routine,8_4,T,yq,,Woh baat karo?
5,"Yes, Well, I have to buy everything in pairs or in twos. And if I only have one thing I won't buy it I'll put it back or I'll look around the store for another thing so that I have two things to buy.Y",symp/reasoning,8_5,P,id,,"Haan, dekh, mujhe sab cheezon ko jodkar ya do-do ki pairon mein khareedna padta hai. Aur agar mere paas sirf ek cheez hai to main use nahi kharidungi, main use lautakar rakh dungi ya fir dukaan mein idhar-udhar dekhungi ki mujhe doosri cheez mil jaaye taaki main do cheezein kharid sakun."
6,"So when you go into store, if you just have one thing you want to buy one item you went there for you will buy a second item or even more just Second,",routine,8_6,T,irq,,"Toh jab tum store mein jaoge, agar tumhare paas sirf ek cheez khareedne ke liye jana tha, jiske liye tum wahin gaye the, toh tum ek doosri cheez bhi khareed loge ya aur bhi zyada, bas."
7,sometimes it can be more as long as it's reached the minimum of two.,symp/reasoning,8_7,P,id,,"Sometimes yeh ho sakta hai ki it's zaada ho, bas itni der mein agar kamse kam do tak pahuncha hua ho."
8,"So you have to leave having purchased a minimum of two, right? Or if you can't find something else, you won't buy it at all. Exactly. So So zero would also be acceptable.",symp/reasoning,8_8,T,orq,,"Tumhe ko toh kam se kam do karid kar chhodna hoga, na? Ya fir kuch aur nahi milta toh bilkul nahi kharidoge. Sahi baat hai. Toh zero bhi chalega."
9,Zero would be acceptable.,symp/reasoning,8_9,P,od,,Zero acceptible ho jayega.
10,"But one, ",symp/reasoning,8_10,T,orq,,"Par ek,"
11,"no, no, no, I can't do just one guy can't do one. Okay. Now, it's got to be two or more.",symp/reasoning,8_11,P,od,,"Nahi, nahi, nahi, main sirf ek vyakti nahi kar sakta. Thik hai. Ab do ya do se adhik vyakti hone chahiye."
12,And what happens that has ever been the occasion where you've only purchased one thing?,symp/reasoning,8_12,T,irq,,"और इससे क्या हो गया है कि कभी ऐसा अवसर हुआ है, जहां आपने केवल एक चीज़ खरी"
13,I can't really remember one. I'm sure there has been but I can't really remember one.,symp/reasoning,8_13,P,id,,Mujhe ek sachmuch yaad nahi aa raha hai. Main sure hu ki hogaya hoga par mujhe sahi se yaad nahi aa raha hai.
14," So for all this period of time, you have successfully either purchase nothing, or two or more items.",symp/reasoning,8_14,T,orq,,"Toh itna samay ke liye, tumne safal roop se ya toh kuch bhi kharida nahi, ya do ya adhik cheezen khareedi hain."
15,"Oh, yeah. I have to it's very anxiety producing if I don't know",symp/reasoning,8_15,P,od,,"Oh, haan. Mujhe karna hai varna yeh bohot anxiety produce karta hai agar mujhe pata nahi."
16,how anxiety producing,symp/reasoning,8_16,T,irq,,Yeh chinta utpann kaise karega?
17,"it, I just feel like something bad will happen. If I don't keep it to two or more.",symp/reasoning,8_17,P,id,,"Main hoon na, mujhe bas lagta hai ki kuch bura ho jayega. Agar main usse do ya usse zyada nahi karta."
18,"You know, what would happen? give a specific.",routine,8_18,T,irq,,"Tu jaanta hai, kya hoga? ek vishesh suchna de."
19,"Well, for example, like my family would be in a car accident, or I would hit deer or you know, get fired from my job.",story,8_19,P,id,,"Toh, for example, jaise hi meri family ko car accident mein ho jata hai, ya toh main deer ko hit kar leta hu ya phir, you know, mujhe apne job se nikal diya jata hai."
20,"So something really, really bad will happen. This is hurtful for you. This is causing you pain. ",symp/reasoning,8_20,T,yq,,"Kuch toh bahut hi, bahut hi bura hone wala hai. Yeh tumhare liye dardnak hai. Yeh tumhe dard de raha hai."
21,Yes.,inactive,8_21,P,ack,,Haan. (
22,"And this would happen. This would really happen on any shopping trip where you just want one thing you'd be reminded, so if you went in wanting more than one thing, it's not a problem, right?",symp/reasoning,8_22,T,irq,,"Aur yeh hoga. Yeh bilkul hoga har shopping trip pe jahan aap sirf ek cheez chaahte hain aap ko yaad dilaaya jaayega, toh agar aap ek se zyaada cheezon ke liye gaye, tab bhi yeh koi masla nahi hai, na?"
23,It's if I only really need one thing And then I can't just buy that one thing that I need.,symp/reasoning,8_23,P,id,,यदि मुझे एक ही चीज चाहिए हो और फिर मैं उसी एक चीज को खरीदना ना मुझे आवश्यक हो।
24,"Alright, so how often does this happen? Where you are in a situation where you want to make a purchase of just one item? And you have to you have to change because the anxiety ",symp/reasoning,8_24,T,irq,,"Thik hai, toh kitni baar yeh hota hai? Jahaan tum kisi sthiti mein ho jahaan tum sirf ek cheez kharidna chahte ho? Aur tumhe badalna padta hai kyunki chinta ho."
25,"daily,",symp/reasoning,8_25,P,id,,"Roz,"
26,daily?,routine,8_26,T,yq,,Roz?
27,"yeah, because I mean, if I go grocery shopping or if I go clothes shopping or for any kind of money transactional thing, you know, which I would encounter daily pretty much it happens",symp/reasoning,8_27,P,ack,,"Haan, kiunki yaar, agar main kirane ki dukan ya phir kapde ki dukan jaata hoon ya fir kisi bhi tarah ki paise se judi cheez ke liye, pata hai na, jise main rozana bahut saral hai"
28,I would like fill up your car gasoline.,symp/reasoning,8_28,T,gc,,Mujhe aapke car mein petrol bharwana hai.
29,Oh then oh bipac accom.,inactive,8_29,P,gc,,Arre fir bipac ke saath.
30,So it has an effect that level two.,inactive,8_30,T,yq,,So us par doosra level ka asar hota hai.
31,Yeah.,inactive,8_31,P,ack,,Haan.
32,"So you're thinking it almost like the number of transactions has to be more than one. I mean, it has to be two or zero.",symp/reasoning,8_32,T,irq,,Toh tum soch rahe ho ki transactions ki sankhya ek se zyada honi chahiye. Yaani ki do ya fir koi bhi honi chahiye.
33,"Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. No. Or vitamins or number of transactions? Yeah. Because see if I get gas, then I have the gas in my car. That's the thing.",story,8_33,P,id,,"Haan, mujhe lagta hai. Haan. Nahi. Ya to vitamins ho, ya phir transaction sankhya? Haan. Kyunki dekho, agar mujhe gas mil jaaye, tab mere paas gaadi mein gas ho jaye. Yeh to cheez hai."
34,"That's one transaction and one thing and one thing, okay. And then. Okay, so that's one product, right? And you need another product. Right? So you really can't feel your car without going inside the station. Store.",story,8_34,T,irq,,"Woh ek transaction hai aur ek cheez hai aur ek cheez, theek hai. Fir. Theek hai, toh woh ek product hai, sahi hai na? Aur tumhe ek aur product ki zarurat hai. Sahi hai na? Toh tumhe sach mein apni car ko petrol pump ke andar jaane bina nahi chala sakoge. Dukaan."
35,NO,inactive,8_35,P,ack,,"""नही"
36,"So it doesn't matter that there's more than one gallon going in, is because it's the same product. ",story,8_36,T,yq,,"Toh koi farak nahi padta ki zyada se zyada ek gallon jaa raha hai, kyunki wo ek hi product hai."
37,Exactly. Yes.,inactive,8_37,P,ack,,ठीक है।
38,"So I could see now this, this would be more of a daily thing. You said, Right. Yeah. Because at first I was thinking daily. That's a lot of individual shopping trips, but it applies to all transaction. ",symp/reasoning,8_38,T,irq,,"Ab maine ye dekh sakte hain, ye zyada tar ek roz ka kaam hoga. Tumne kaha, Sahi hai. Haan. Kyunki pehle mujhe roz ka khayal tha. Ye bahut saare alag-alag shopping safar hai, lekin ye sabhi transactions par lagu hota hai."
39,Exactly. Yeah. I did really realize that that way. But it does. Yeah. Yeah.,symp/reasoning,8_39,P,id,,Haan. Haan. Mujhe sach mein pata chala ki waisa hi hai. Par aisa hai. Haan. Haan.
40,So this is a fairly significant source of anxiety for you.,routine,8_40,T,irq,,Ise source of anxiety hamare liye kaafi significant hai.
41,"Yes, it is. It does. Pr I get, you know, like, builds up in me and I feel it.",routine,8_41,P,id,,"Haan, yehi hai. Yeh karta hai. Jab mein samajhti hoon, tumhe pata hai, jaise, mere andar se bhar jaata hai aur mujhe mehsoos hota hai."
42,"So let's talk about that. And help me to understand this better. So let's say that you went to a convenience store, and just had one thing in mind, what might be a potential item that you would gum? gum, right? So you want to go in and you just want to buy a pack of gum. That's all you really want. That's why you stopped at the store. ",story,8_42,T,irq,,"Chalo chalo baat karte hai iske baare mein. Aur meri madad karo isko behtar tareeke se samajhne mein. To chalo maano ki tumne ek convenience store pe jaake, sirf ek cheez ka socha tha, toh kya woh cheez ho sakti hai jise tum chabao? Chabana, sahi hai na? Toh tum andar jaao aur sirf ek pack chabane ka hi khareedna chao. Wahi tumhari asli khwahish hai. Isiliye tumne store pe rukha tha."
43,Right,story,8_43,P,ack,,Sahi hai
44," So you go in, you have any thoughts? Now we talked in the past about automatic thoughts, these thoughts just kind of come in, right. So are there any thoughts in there happening when you're walking into the store?",story,8_44,T,irq,,"Toh tum andar jaate ho, tumhare pass koi khayal hain? Abhi hum pehle aapni automatic khayal ke baare mein baat kar rahe the, woh khayal khud se aa jaate hai, sahi? Toh kya tum store mein jaate waqt kuch khayal aate hai?"
45,"Yeah, I start. I start with what do I need? Why am I here? You know, I need a pack of gum. And then it's instant anxiety that what else am I gonna get? What else can I get to make it the two?",story,8_45,P,id,,"Haan, main shuru karta hun. Main shuru karta hun ke mere paas kya chahiye? Kya main yahan kyun hoon? Pata hai, mujhe ek pack gum ki zaroorat hai. Aur phir turant ghabrahat ho jaati hai ke aur kya le sakta hun? Aur kya aur le sakta hun jisse yeh do ban jaaye?"
46,"All right. So the thought is What else can I get? Yeah, like this one, the past will be two has to be two. It has to be two. That's not that's Yeah. So that's also possible more demanding. Yeah. So it has to be.",story,8_46,T,orq,,"Bas thik hai. toh yeh soch raha hai ki Main aur kya pa sakta hoon? Haan, jaise yeh wala, pehle do hoga do zaroori hai. Yeh do hona hi chahiye. Woh nahi hai, wo haan. Toh yeh bhi possible hai ki zyada demanding ho. Haan. Toh yeh hona hi chahiye."
47,Yeah. So I guess the first thought is what else? What else do I have to get? Yeah. And then so jumps right,story,8_47,P,od,,Haan. Toh main sochta hoon ki pehla khayal ye hai ki aur kya? Aur mujhe aur kuch praapt karna hai ya nahi? Haan. Aur phir seedhe chala jaata hai.
48,to the anxiety. So is the anxiety,story,8_48,T,irq,,चिंता को भी हो जाता है। यही है वह
49,"It starts going down. Okay,",story,8_49,P,id,,Yeh niche jaane laga hai. Theek hai.
50,so it's really gradually,story,8_50,T,yq,,Toh woh sach mein dhire dhire hai.
51,"Yes, but it is really it is really Yes. Once it completely gone. When I'm done that",story,8_51,P,op,,"Yes, magar yeh sach hai ki yeh sach hai. Ek baar wo bilkul khatam ho gaya. Jab main uska khatma kar dun."
52,"Alright, so you so really the the worst anxiety would be approaching the store entering in that moment of uncertainty. When you don't know the second Yeah,",symp/reasoning,8_52,T,yq,,"Thik hai, toh tu sach mein sabse bura anxious hoga jab tu dukaan ke paas ja raha hai aur uss asmaan mein uncertainty ka waqt aa raha hai. Jab tu nahi jaanta ki kya hone waala hai."
53,absolutely. All right.,symp/reasoning,8_53,P,ack,,"Absolutely karo, thik hai."
54,"Okay. So if you could relieve that anxiety, that would be one of your goals. ",routine,8_54,T,yq,,"Thik hai. To agar tu us chinta ko kam kar sake, toh vo tere lakshyo mein se ek hoga."
55,That would be fantastic. Fantastic.,routine,8_55,P,op,,"Uff, yeh toh fantastic hi hoga. Fantastic."
56,All right. So let's think about this way. Do you? Do you know the reason that you do this? You have any guesses?,routine,8_56,T,orq,,Theek hai. To chaaliye is baare mein sochhte hain. Kya tum karte ho? Kya tumhe pata hai ki tum iska kaaran kyu karte ho? Kuch shaakhein hain tumhare paas?
57,"I would guess that. I mean, we've talked about you my dad had some bad experiences I had I sound awful. Yeah, they've, they were difficult. So I wonder if that's not somehow linked to this behavior somehow. Being impossibly",symp/reasoning,8_57,P,od,,"Mai toh guess kar sakta hun. Matlab, humne teri baare mein baat ki thi, mere dad ne kuch bura anubhav kiya tha, main toh bura lag raha hoon. Haan, woh, unke liye mushkil the. Toh shayad ye kisi tarah is vyavahar se jude hain. Hona bhi nahi chahiye ye sab."
58,Alright. So you've been through some really tough times to put it mildly. And what You're afraid of if you only buy the one item? Is something safety related happening?,symp/reasoning,8_58,T,irq,,"Arey. So you've been through some really difficult situations, to put it lightly. Aur agar tum sirf ek cheez kharidoge toh kya darr hai? Kya koi suraksha se sambandhit baat ho rahi hai?"
59,Yes. Yes. Like the car accident or the Yes. Safety. Definitely my personal safety or my family's safety.,symp/reasoning,8_59,P,id,,Haan. Haan. Jaise ki car accident ya phir haan. Suraksha. Bilkul meri vyaktigat suraksha ya meri parivaar ki suraksha.
60,And I guess security like the,routine,8_60,T,irq,,Aur main soch raha hoon ki security jaisi hi hogi
61,"security Yeah. And yeah, security.",routine,8_61,P,id,,"""Security. Aur haan, security bhi."""
62,So safety and security. They're at risk for you.,symp/reasoning,8_62,T,yq,,"""Toh suraksha aur surakshitata. Unhe aapke liye khatre me hai."""
63,Yes.,inactive,8_63,P,ack,,Haan.
64,"When you don't follow this role, the rule and I will Yeah. So if we think about it in terms of the cognitive model, we talked about the core beliefs and the intermediate beliefs, which are the attitudes and assumptions expectations, so the core belief here the only thoughts when it might be",story,8_64,T,orq,,"Tum ye rule nahi follow karoge toh mei bhi nahi karunga. Aisa hi hai na ki agar hum ise cognitive model mein sochein, toh humne core beliefs aur intermediate beliefs discuss kiye the, jo ki attitudes aur assumptions expectations hote hain. Iski core belief yahi hai ki bas vohi vichar honge jab iske chances honge."
65,"well, now that you said that, or you know, pointed out those safety security issues, I didn't really realize that but it is. Maybe that just that I'm not okay, I'm not",symp/reasoning,8_65,P,od,,"Accha, abb jab tumne yeh bola ya fir tum jante ho, un suraksha surakshitata samasyao ko dikha diya, maine woh sach mein pehle nahi samjha tha lekin hai. Shayad woh sirf yeh hai ki main thik nahi hoon, main nahi hoon."
66,"I'm not okay. I'm not safe. I am vulnerable,",symp/reasoning,8_66,T,irq,,मैं ठीक नहीं हूँ। मैं सुरक्षित नहीं हूँ।
67,"vulnerable. Yeah, I'm vulnerable. Am I an exposed? exposed to danger to?",symp/reasoning,8_67,P,id,,Mujhe khuli aur khona-khona lagta hai. Main khula-danwaan hun. Khatare se khula-danwaan hun kya?
68,Sure at risk? Yeah.,symp/reasoning,8_68,T,irq,,Pakka risk mein hai kya? Haan.
69,That's my rule.,inactive,8_69,P,id,,Yeh meri niyam hai.
70,"And then when a situation presents itself, which would be an impending transaction. That's the situation we talked about how the situation blends together. With that, in this case rule that intermediate. So when they come together, what's that automatic thought?",story,8_70,T,irq,,"Aur jab wo halat khud ko pesh kare, jo ek nazdiki len-den hoga. Yeh hai wahi halat jiski humne baat ki thi ki kaise yeh halat ek saath milte hain. Iss ke sath, iss maamle mein beech ka kaanoon hota hai. To jab wo ek saath aate hain, usse kya lagta hai?"
71,When the situation and,inactive,8_71,P,id,,Jab haalat aur
72,"trends potential transactions approaching you, and you handed me a belief I need to buy everything",story,8_72,T,irq,,"त्रेन्ड्स की संभावित लेन-देन, आपको नज़दीक से आ रहे हैं, और आपने मुझे एक विश्वास"
73,in tears. What else am I getting in?,inactive,8_73,P,id,,"Haaye, mujhe aur kya mil raha hai? Ansoo bahate hue."
74,And then what's the behavior? That is a product of that automatic thought of I do you buy the second item? Yeah. And the feeling is the feeling of falls.,story,8_74,T,irq,,"Aur phir kya hua? Woh ek prakriya hai jisse us automatic vichaar ka utpaad hota hai, ki kya main tumhe doosri cheez khareedoun? Haan. Aur woh ehsaas hai falls ka ehsaas."
75,that follows that purchase of,inactive,8_75,P,id,,wo logon se writing Krna purchase of ke follow kreyo
76,"well, the follows on Mac thought, oh, anxiety, anxiety, and then what's the feeling that follows the purchase? Yeah. Relief relief. Alright. So can you see how the mechanism what's happening to you could be explained one explanation through through the cognitive load",symp/reasoning,8_76,T,orq,,"acha, yeh Mac ke follow karne wale hai soche, oh, chinta, chinta, aur phir khareedne ke baad kaisa mehsoos hota hai? Haan. Sukoon sukoon. Tik hai. To kya aap dekh sakte hai ki aapke saath kya ho raha hai, ek vichaar se kaise samjhaya ja sakta hai through through the cognitive load."
77,there much it didn't sit very well.,inactive,8_77,P,od,,Woh bahut zyada baitha nahi.
78,"Alright. So let's talk about the rule of the Rule of Two. Now we, we, we talked before, we're talking about cognitive therapy, about useful and less than useful thoughts, right? functional and less functional or dysfunctional. thoughts. Do you think that sitting here now, not so much necessarily in the store? I know that's probably a different thought process. But talking with me now, do you see a causal connection between purchasing two items and a safety or security breach?",story,8_78,T,irq,,"Thik hai. Toh chalo hum baat kare Rule of Two ke rule ke baare mein. Ab hum, hum, hum pehle bhi baat kar chuke hai, hum cognitive therapy ke baare mein baat kar rahe the, useful aur kam useful thoughts, sahi aur kum sahi ya phir benaam thoughts ke baare mein. Kya tum sochte ho ki abhi yahan baithne se zyada store mein purchase karne se kya hume safety ya security breach ka khatra hai?"
79,"Yeah. I mean, there's no I recognize you recognize your Work and stuff that it's not. It doesn't make sense. It's not a useful, a useful thought maybe",inactive,8_79,P,id,,"Haan. Matlab, mein kehna chahta hoon, iss baare mein I teri Work ko recognize karta hu aur yeh sab cheezein hai jo nahi hai. Yeh toh bilkul sense nahi karta. Yeh ek useful thought nahi hai, shayad."
80,it's not a useful in this case thought munei useful intermediate belief.,inactive,8_80,T,orq,,यो मुनेरुसोंले यो विषयमा उपयुक्त हुँदैन भन्ने त चिन्ता
81,"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,8_81,P,od,,"Haan, haan."
82,"So you recognize that you appreciate that. There is not a link between Elio purchasing here. And in either direction, though, right meaning, so you realize that, that if you buy to, this doesn't necessarily keep you safe either. So you can't introduce safety or the process of risk of being unsafe, you can't introduce risk or safety through your transacting behavior.",symp/reasoning,8_82,T,irq,,"Toh tumhe pata hai ki tumhe yeh pata hai. Yahaan Elio ke khareedne se koi sambandh nahi hai. Aur kisi disha mein bhi, sahi matlab hai, isliye tum samajh rahe ho, ki agar tum khareedte ho, toh yeh aapko surakshit nahi rakhta hai. Isliye tum apni vyavahar se suraksha ya ghatna se bachne ke risk ko dikhate nahi, risk ya suraksha ko apne vyavahar ke through laana nahi sakte."
83,That's very true. Yeah.,routine,8_83,P,id,,Bilkul sach hai. Haan.
84,Does that make sense?,routine,8_84,T,yq,,Kya woh samajh mein aata hai?
85,"Yeah, it does. It really does. I Can't it doesn't make what you're saying makes sense. But it doesn't make sense to introduce safety or either side of the point.",routine,8_85,P,ack,,"Haa, ye krti hai. Ye sach me krti hai. I can't bolne mein sense nahi karta ki tum kya bol rahe ho. Lekin safety introduce karna ya to kisi bhi point ke do taraf sense nahi karta."
86,So do overs or rest are not influenced by your behavior.,routine,8_86,T,yq,,Toh kya garbari se phir se karna ya aaram karna humare vyavhar par prabhavit nahi hote hai.
87,Yeah.,inactive,8_87,P,ack,,Yeah ha.
88,"But that's not what your mind is telling you. That's not what your thoughts are telling you. That's logical. And you can sit here with me. And it's not easy to say, but you can say, Yeah, I don't see a link.",routine,8_88,T,orq,,"Parantu, voh tumhare mann ko batara nahi hai. Voh tumhare khayal bata rahe hai. Voh logical hai. Aur tum mere saath yaha baith sakte ho. Aur kehna aasan nahi hai, lekin tum keh sakte ho, haan, mujhe koi rishta nazar nahi aa raha."
89,"Yeah, I don't see a link, but I know what I feel and what I feel is that impending doom, if you will.",routine,8_89,P,od,,"Haan, main koi link nahi dekh raha par main jaanta hoon keh mujhe kya mehsoos hota hai aur mujhe mehsoos yeh hai keh honewala khatra, agar aap chahe toh."
90,"So let's talk about that moment. So in this moment, maybe a little anxious now, but you can kind of see how, right you can't protect yourself or cause harm to yourself or anyone else. By buying to or failing to buy to write in the store, or wherever you make the transaction, different story. So you have, let's, let's go a different direction. I talked about how you walk into a store, and you think, well, I get those the phone, right? And you end up getting something else. Yes, the anxiety then kind of goes away. And we'll come up the next time that happens. But it's a way it's gone for that moment. So, I want you to kind of stay with me as I go through another scenario. And you maybe have figured out what I'm going to do here, but",routine,8_90,T,orq,,"Toh chalo uss pal ke baare mein baat karenge. Iss pal mein, thoda sa anxious hone lage ho, par tum dekh sakte ho ki, tum khud ko bachane ya khud ko ya kisi aur ko nuksaan pahuchane ki koshish nahi kar sakte ho. Jaise ki agar tum store se kuch kharidte ho ya kharidhne se refrain karte ho, woh alag baat hai. Toh tumhe, chalo, hum kuch aur direction mein jaa sakte hain. Maine baat kari thi ki tum store mein jaate ho aur sochte ho ki, haan, mujhe woh phone lena hai, par tum kuch aur le aate ho. Haan, phir anxiety thodi kam ho jaati hai aur next time jab yeh ho sakta hai toh jaan chhoot jaati hai. Par yeh uss pal ke liye gayab ho jaata hai. Toh, main chahta hoon ki tum mere saath raho jab main ek aur scenario ke baare mein baat karunga. Aur shayad tumne samajh liya hoga ki main iss scenario mein kya karne wala hoon, par..."
91,I need it in your scenario. Okay.,routine,8_91,P,od,,Mujhe teri situation mein chahiye. Theek hai.
92,"So maybe GM isn't the ideal example but you see my right yeah. See, you go into the now you go to the store, you realize you only have enough resources to make the one transaction and you really want it so zero is not. So, now walk me through the thoughts and the feelings",story,8_92,T,irq,,"Toh shayad GM perfect udahran nahi hai, lekin dekho mera point toh sahi hai na. Samjhe, ab tum abhi jaate ho dukaan mein, tab tumhe pata chalta hai ki tumhare paas sirf itne resources hai ki ek hi transaction kar sake aur tumhe sach mein chahiye hai toh zero ho nahi sakti hai. Toh ab mere saath apne thoughts aur feelings ko explain karo."

The patient has the urge to look for another things around the store if they have only one thing to buy. They are okay to not buy anything at all too. The patient clarifies it applies to any money transactions which has to be two or zero. The patient experiences worse anxiety when they enter a shop without knowing the second item. The patient believes that this behavior is linked to their personal and family's safety. They feel vulnerable. The patient feels relieved when they buy two items. The patient can have bearable anxiety triggered just be talking about one transactions. The therapist suggests to buy one coffee, and once it is done a 100 times, the patient's anxiety would get exhausted. The patient agrees to try and affirms they didn't feel to link this to safety and security. This can reduce their symptoms. The therapist gives another suggestion to buy gasoline alone and get back home. If they successfully get back home, that a mark of completion and victory to the patient. The therapist asks to respond them with adaptive response for the two, and make note of their experience.",,,,,
