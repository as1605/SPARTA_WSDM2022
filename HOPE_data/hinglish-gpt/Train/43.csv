I'm thinking about these poor girls. And, you know, it's the government, like, the government has cameras everywhere, and they can watch what I'm doing it all times. And it's, you know, it's exhausting. So I can see how he would think I'm depressed. Because, you know, I'm bored. I, you know, I'm not sleeping well, and I'm not eating because what if they poisoned my food? You know, they're poisoning water all the time. So, you know, it is scary and it is affecting anybody.

Aur, pata hai, yeh sarkar, matlab, sarkar ke paas cameras hain har jagah par, aur wo mere saare kaam ko dekh sakte hain. Aur yeh, pata hai, bohot thakaan hai. Isliye main samajh sakta hu ke wo soch raha hoga ki main depressed hu. Kyuki, pata hai, boredom hai. Pata hai, main achi tarah se nahi soch raha hu aur main khana bhi nahi kha raha hu kyuki kya pata kahi wo mera khana zeharila na banaye? Pata hai, wo har waqt paani ko zehreela kar sakte hain.

34,Were there any beliefs like this before? Two months?,routine,43_34,T,irq,,"""Kya pahle aisi koi bhavnaayein thi? Do mahine?"""
35,"I mean, yes. I've always been aware that the government you know, is probably up just to things that they probably shouldn't be and that they have access and abilities beyond, you know, the normal person. But after I saw the kidnapping, I had proof and so it's it's gotten worse because I feel like they know that I know.",story,43_35,P,id,,"Main bata raha tha, haan. Mujhe humesha se pata tha ki sarkar, tu jaanta hai na, woh shayad aise cheezon ko karte hain jo shayad unhe karna nahi chahiye aur unke paas pahunch aur kshamata hai, normal insaan ke muqabale mein. Lekin jab maine kidnapping dekhi, mere paas saboot aa gaye aur isliye woh aur bhi bura ho gaya hai kyunki mujhe lagta hai ki woh jaante hain ki main jaanta hoon."
36,"So you felt this way for a while, but seeing what you saw two months ago that made you more short?",routine,43_36,T,irq,,"Tu abhi thodi der se aise hi mehsoos kar raha tha, par jab tune do mahine pehle jo dekha tha jo tujhe aur kamzor bana diya?"

38,because I have proof Have you ever been treated for depression in the past?,symp/reasoning,43_38,T,irq,,"Kyunki mere paas saboot hai, ki kya aap pehle kabhi depression ka ilaaj karvaya hai?"
39,"Yes. My dad has taken me before when he was worried about me. But I, you know, it's never really been depression. It's always been something else. Like, I'm fine. I just, I'm aware of what's going on around me. And I don't think my dad understands that I don't think the places he takes me understands that. So",story,43_39,P,id,,"Haan. Mere papa pehle mujhe le chuke hain jab wo mujhe chinta thi. Lekin main, tu jaanta hai, yeh hamesha depression nahi tha. Hamesha kuch aur hi tha. Jaise, main theek hoon. Bas, mujhe pata hai ki mere aas-paas kya ho raha hai. Aur main nahi lagta ki mere papa ko yeh samajh aata hai aur mujhe le jaane waale jagah ko bhi nahi samajh aata hai. Isliye."
40,"what have the people at the places where he has taken, you know, what have they said about your condition?",symp/reasoning,43_40,P,irq,,"Tum jaante ho, jahaan woh gaya hai, logon ne kya kaha hai teri haalat ke baare mein?"
41,"Um, you know, they, they try to say the same thing that you know, I'm depressed or whatever, but, you know, I know I know the truth and sometimes I just have to play along.",symp/reasoning,43_41,P,id,,"Arre, tu jaanta hai na, woh, woh koshish karte hai ki wohi cheez bol de ki main depressed hoon ya fir kuch bhi, lekin, tu jaanta hai na, main jaanta hoon ki sachai kya hai aur kabhi kabhi mujhe bas sath dena padta hai."
42,Just play along with it.,routine,43_42,T,gc,,Bas inapr muje uske sang khelna hai.
43,"Yeah, because, you know, this is what the government wants, they want me to look crazy. So there's nothing I can do about it.",story,43_43,P,gc,,"Haan, kyunki, tu toh jaanta hai na, yeh hi hai jo sarkar chahti hai, unhe mujhe pagal dikhaiye. Isiliye main kuch nahi kar sakti."
44,You think they want to discredit you?,routine,43_44,T,irq,,Kya tumhe lagta hai ki unhe tumhe badnaam karna hai?
45,"Because if I if, you know, it's kind of like smearing my good name. They see me in and out of different agencies and appearing crazy. You know, obviously a lot of people don't believe the story they choose not to believe where they get paid off. And they write what they write on my file but it's not true. I'm just know what's going on.",story,43_45,P,id,,"Because agar main agar, tum jaante ho, it's kind of like meri acchi reputation ko kharab kar raha hai. Wo log mujhe alag alag agencies mein dekhte hain aur timepass karte hain. Tum jaante ho, waise toh bahut saare log meri story pe believe nahi karte, wo apni marzi se decide karte hain ki unhe maanna hai ya nahi. Aur wo log meri file mein likhte hain jo unhe likhna hota hai, lekin sach toh yeh nahi hai. Main bas jaanta hoon ki kya ho raha hai."
46,Because you know what's going on. That's what's led to all these occurrences. This is This has led to the symptoms.,story,43_46,T,id,,Kyunki tumhe pata hai kya ho raha hai. Wahi ho raha hai jo in sab ghatnaon ka karan hai. Yah hi hai jo lakshanon ki taraf le gaya hai.
47,"Yeah, like lately Yeah. Like, you know, I haven't been asleep, you know, and, you know, I feel guilty about what's going on. Right. mean that I know and that, you know, I feel it's hard for me to help them, like with, you know, cameras everywhere and I came to the grocery store without being watched. And I know they're watching me so you know, I I do everything else was too, you know like I go to work I do the chores, because I have to make sure they see me going to work chores.",story,43_47,P,id,,"Haan, abhi tak Haan. Jaise tum jaante ho, mai so nahi rahi thi, aur tumko pata hai, aur mai is baat se thoda pareshan hun. Theek hai. Yeh matlab hai ki mai jaanti hun aur, tumhe pata hai, mujhe unki madad karne mein mushkil hai, jaise, tumko pata hai, har jagah cameras hai aur mai grocery store gayi bina dekhe hue ja rahi hun. Aur tum jaante ho, ki woh mujhe dekh rahe hai, toh main dusra sab kuch karti hun, tumko pata hai jaise mujhe kaam pe jaana hota hai, jaise mai kaam karta hun, kyunki mujhe unhe dikhaana hota hai ki mai kaam pe ja raha hun."
48,So you see you kind of play along.,routine,43_48,T,crq,,"Toh tum dekhte ho, tum thoda sa khelte bhi ho."
49,Yeah.,routine,43_49,P,cd.ack,,Haan.
50,All right. So do you ever have any thoughts related to death or dying or anything like that?,routine,43_50,T,yq,,Theek hai. Kya tumhare mann mein kabhi mrityu ya maut se judi koi vichar aate hain ya kuch aisa?

53,You worried about what?,routine,43_53,T,irq,,Tum kis baat se pareshan ho?
54,"I mean. I'm worried about the government, you know, destroying My life, you know, but I don't want to die and I don't think they're going to kill me. I think that'd be too easy. And it would just be more proof.",story,43_54,P,id,,"Mai to ghabra rahi hu sarkaar ke baare mein, pata hai, wo meri zindagi ko barbaad kar degi, pata hai, lekin main marna nahi chahti aur mujhe lagta hai wo mujhe maarne waale nahi hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki wo bahut aasaan hoga, aur ye saboot ki baat hogi."
55,So there'll be more proof that the way you've seen this real,routine,43_55,T,crq,,Isliye zyada sabooth hoga ki jaise aapne yeh haqeeqat dekhi hai
56,"correct, because obviously I'm trying to tell people about it. And if I suddenly show up missing, like there, people are going to know. So I know that they're not going to hurt me, but they could make me look crazy and I'm worried about my life. Like them worried in my life.",story,43_56,P,cd,,"""The baat is sach, I'm trying to sab log se batao about it. And agar I suddenly go missing, jaise wahaan, log ko pata chalega. So I jaanu ki they won't nuksaan me, but they could make me dikhaa crazy and I'm worried about my jeene ki khatra. Like, unke worries are hamari zindagi par."""
