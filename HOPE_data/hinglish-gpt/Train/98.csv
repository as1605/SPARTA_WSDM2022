8,"Well, that's great.",inactive,98_8,T,op,,"Achha, woh bohot accha hai."
9,"Okay. So ever since I got back from my exchange semester Actually, I've been feeling kind of anxious about graduating later than my friends because of the exchange semester itself. Because I need to take some extra subjects and that means I need to take an extra semester too. So the biggest possibilityis that I'm going to be left behind from all of my peers. So, that kind of make me anxious and yeah, I'm kind of butterflies at the back.",symp/reasoning,98_9,P,id,-2.0,"Okay. Toh ever since I got back from my exchange semester toh I've been feeling kind of restless about the fact that I will graduate later than my friends because of the exchange semester itself. Kyunki mujhe kuch extra subjects bhi lena hoga and that means I will have to take one more semester. So the biggest possibility hai ki I'm going to be left behind from all of my peers. So, isiliye I feel anxious and yeah, I'm kind of having butterflies at the back."
10,"Okay, so you're saying that you're feeling anxious and you're worried that that you're going to be left behind by your friends? The fact that they're in their graduate before you. So what is exactly bothering you is that you know, you think your friends are gonna all gore or the things that you need to catch up with some subjects that you left for your exchange program?",routine,98_10,T,irq,,"Thik hai, toh tu keh raha hai ki tu chinta mein hai aur tu chinta kar raha hai ki tere doston ke dum se tu peeche chhoot jaayega? Yeh baat jo hai ki wo tere se graduate karne ke pehle hai. Toh kya pakka tujhe pareshaan kar raha hai yeh hai ki tereko pata hai, tere dost sab jaayenge ya jo subjects hai unme tu catch up karne ki zaroorat hai jo tu apne exchange program ke liye chhod diya tha?"
11,"Well, yeah, oh, the first one is because that I'm not ready yet to be left with all my friends, and then also because if I need to take an extra semester then it also means that I need to pay an extra tuition for the semester, right?",symp/reasoning,98_11,P,irq,,"Aare, haan, waise, na pehli wala toh uska matlab hai ki main apne sare doston ke saath chodne ke liye abhi taiyar nahi hoon, aur phir bhi, agar mujhe ek aur semester lena padega toh yeh bhi matlab hai ki mujhe ek aur fees deni hogi us semester ke liye, sahi toh na?"
12,"Oh, I see. Okay. Are you paying your tuition for yourself? Or is anybody supporting you?",routine,98_12,T,yq,,"Oh, Main samajh gaya. Thik hai. Kya tum apne fees khud bhar rahe ho? Ya koi aur tumhari madad kar raha hai?"
13,"Well, no, my parents paid for me.",routine,98_13,P,id,,"Haan, nahi, mere parents ne mujhe ke liye pay kiya."
14,Okay. Your parents? ,routine,98_14,T,crq,,Thik hai. Tumhare maa-baap
15,"Yeah. And that's why I feel bad for them to so that they have to pay for my tuition or a nice dry semester when actually it should be done in this like in my semester, but it's taken me years. Okay.",story,98_15,P,cd,,"Haan. Aur yeh hi wajah hai ki main unke liye dukhi hoon ki woh mere fees ya ek achcha sa khushk semester ke liye unko pay karna padta hai, jabki asal mein yeh mere semester mein hona chahiye, par ab tak mujhe saalon lag gaye hain. Theek hai."
16,But but does your parents know that they are has to pay another extra semester?,routine,98_16,T,yq,,Lekin kintu tui to? Tui dekhis ki tui char barak din are bol hain?
17,"Um, no, I haven't. ",routine,98_17,P,on,,"Nahi, maine nahi kiya hai."
18,You haven't tell them?,routine,98_18,T,yq,,Tumne unhe bataaya nahi?
19,Yes.,routine,98_19,P,op,,Haan.
20,Do you think you will tell them?,routine,98_20,T,orq,,kya aapko lagta hai ki tum unhe bataoge?
21,"Yeah, I think probably I should tell them. ",routine,98_21,P,od,,"Haan, main soch rha hun ke shayad mujhe unhe bta dena chahiye."
22,"Yeah. And how do you think they will react to like, how can you think?",routine,98_22,T,orq,,Haan. Aur tume lagta hai ki woh kaise react karenge jaise:- Tum soch sakte ho?
23,"Well I don't think they will be mad or something, I think. I think they will be just fine with paying for another semester, but it's just that I feel I feel bad for them ",symp/reasoning,98_23,P,od,-1.0,"Well main nahi sochta ki woh pagal honge ya kuch, main sochta hoon. Main sochta hoon ke unhe doosre semester ke liye bhugtaan karne mein koi parvaah nahi hogi, lekin bas yeh hai ki mujhe unke liye afsos hai."
24,"Yeah, yeah, I understand. Okay. So, um, regarding tuition fee, you already know, you already aware that your parents are using that they're not going to be you know, taking it very seriously and you know, that they're gonna be just fine. That they have to be another extra semester for you. Okay, so relating to The thing that you mentioned before, what about now you're conditioned that you have to catch up with some of the subjects that you left behind for your exchange program. Are you doing okay with catching up with the subjects?",routine,98_24,T,irq,,"Haan, haan, main samajh raha hoon. Thik hai. Toh, um, tuition fee ke bare mein, tumhe pata hai na, tumhe pata hai ki tumhare maa baap ke use kar rahe hain, wo bahut seriously lenge aur tumhe pata hai ki wo sirf theek honge. Aur tumhe pata hai, ki tumhare liye ek aur extra semester hona hoga. Thik hai, toh jo tum pahle bata rahe the, abhi usse total kaise haal hain, ki tumhe kuch subjects ki catching up karni padegi jo tumhare exchange program ke liye chod diye the. Kya tum subjects ke sath theek ho raha hai?"
25," Well, yeah, actually, I I don't have any particular difficulties in catching up with the subjects. And yeah, I think I'm doing just fine. ",routine,98_25,P,id,,"Haan, haan, sach, main koi khaas pareshaani nahi hai mere subjects ki understanding se. Aur haan, mujhe lagta hai main kaafi achha kar raha hoon."
26,"You're doing just fine. All right. Okay. So from the story that I've heard from you, what I get is that your parents have no burden that they have to pay another extra tuition for one extra semester for you. Yeah. And that you're also catching up with your subjects just fine. There's no problems. Right. Yeah, that's true. Okay, and one more question. What about your thesis preparation?",routine,98_26,T,irq,,"Tum theek kar rahe ho. Sab sahi hai. Theek hai. To suna hua kahani se mujhe samajh aaya ki tumhare maa-baap ko koi bojh nahi hai ki woh tumhare liye ek aur semester ke liye aur ek extra tution dena padega. Haan. Aur tum apne subjects ko bhi theek se samajh rahe ho. Koi problem nahi hai na. Theek hai. Haan, yeh sach hai. Aur ek aur sawaal. Tumhare thesis ki taiyaari kaisi chal rahi hai?"

28,"Okay. All right. That's, that's great. So you've, you've started out pretty well. So you already finished your first chapter. Mm hmm. Okay, so now summarizing, from all the stories that I've heard, the only issues I think that you're anxious and you're worried that you're going to be left behind by your friends. Yeah. And if I may suggest you I think you can, you know, write down the things or like make lists, the things that you've been done great during your seven year bachelor degree. Yeah, yeah. Cuz you know, right all year because you're, you went for an X Change program, and that's something to be proud of. You don't have to worry about you know, you have to catch up with the subjects and stuff because you can great jobs. You will On an exchange program, and maybe other friends that are going to be graduating soon be don't have the same experience as you are. So it's something that he has to be happy about. Okay. And maybe regarding your thesis preparation, if I suggest you you can make a timeline for your preparation so that you can visualize really about your exact plan towards graduating. So maybe it can also help you graduate faster. You know, it's possible. Yeah. Yeah. Like you can make.

That's, that's great. Toh aapne bahut achha start kiya hai. Aapne pehla chapter toh already complete kar liya hai, bilkul. Okay, toh summarize karte hai, jaise maine suna hai, aapko sirf ek hi problem hai, ke aapke dost aage nikal jayenge aur aap akele reh jayenge. Haanji. Aur agar main suggest karun toh aap, you know, measure kar sakte hai, ya list bana sakte hai, ki aapne apne 7 saal ke bachelor degree mein kya kuch achievements haasil kiye hai. Haan, definitely. Because aap toh exchange program pe gaye the, aur yeh toh bahut badi baat hai. Aapko koi fikar nahi karni chahiye, ki aap subjects aur studies mein peeche ho rahe hai, because aap bahut badiya jobs kar sakte hai.
