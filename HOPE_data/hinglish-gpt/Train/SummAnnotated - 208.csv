",routine,208_11,P,id,,"Arrey yaar, bas kuch hafte hi toh hain. Lekin pata nahi kya ho raha hai, sab bahut hi accha chal raha hai. Mujhe samajh nahi aa raha hai. Mujhe yakeen nahi ho raha hai ke woh bas gaya."
12,"Right. What was it that happened Jane to bring, bring that relationship to an end?",symp/reasoning,208_12,T,irq,,"Theek hai. Kya hua tha ki Jane ne kiya, usne uss rishte ko khatam kar diya?"
13,"Well, like I said, because it was going so well, you know, I asked I asked him to move in, right. And he said that he didn't want to. And we ended up arguing and getting into big fights And then he said he was going and you know, I begged him not to, but you know, he still went anyway.",symp/reasoning,208_13,P,id,,"Toh, maine kaha tha na, kyunki sab kuch acha jar aha tha, toh maine pucha use ki woh rehne aaega mere saath. Aur usne mana kar diya. Fir hum ladne lage aur bade bade jhagde huye. Fir woh kehta hai ki woh ja raha hai aur maine use roka, par woh toh phir bhi chala gaya."
14,So was it after he had gone that you cut?,symp/reasoning,208_14,T,yq,,फिर क्या तुमने कट किया था जब वह चला गया था?
15,Yeah.,symp/reasoning,208_15,P,ack,,Haan.

17,"Well  he's gone, I just felt so I just couldn't bear the pain anymore. ",symp/reasoning,208_17,P,id,,"""Welkam, woh chala gaya. Mujhe bas aisa laga ki mujhe aur dard bardha nahi sambhal paungi."""
18,Right,inactive,208_18,T,ack,,Sahi hai
19,"And my voices which is incessant, And I just you know just want to get rid of all the pain all the voices and so you know just, you know just cut myself.",symp/reasoning,208_19,P,id,,"Aur meri awaaz jo lagatar hai, aur main bas jaanta hun ki saare dard aur awaazein se chhutkara pana chahta hun, isliye bas, tum jaante ho, main bas khud ko kaat leta hun."
20,And did that help with the pain and the voices?,symp/reasoning,208_20,T,irq,,Aur kya usse dard aur awaazon mein madad mili?

I just made it feel better.",symp/reasoning,208_21,P,id,,"Haan, haan, bas haan, mujhe matlab aapne dard ko door kar diya aur aaj raat ko khoon dekhne ka kuchh hai hi kuchh, its fine. Main bas usko behtar kar diya."
22,"So, with the cutting is this something that you've, you've done before",routine,208_22,T,crq,,"Toh, kya tumne pehle ye kaato ke saath kiya hai?"
23,I am doing this since I Was teenager.,symp/reasoning,208_23,P,cd,,Me yeh kar raha hu kyunki main kishor umar se hi hu.
24,Right. Okay. And it sounds like there are times when you do it when it it helps.,routine,208_24,T,crq,,Thik hai. Theek hai. Aur lagta hai ki kabhi kabhi tum ise karte ho jab ye madad karta hai.
25,Yeah.,inactive,208_25,P,ack,,Haan.
26,Right,inactive,208_26,T,ack,,Thik hai
27,and takes the pain off.,symp/reasoning,208_27,P,cd,,aur dard ko dur karta hai.
28,Right. And are there any downsides to the cutting?,symp/reasoning,208_28,T,yq,,Thik hai. Aur koi nuksaan toh hia cutting karne ka?
29,"Well, yeah, I mean, it's been painful  I suppose the main things. My arms and legs are a mess. ",symp/reasoning,208_29,P,ack,,"Haan, haan main maanta hu ki bohot takleef ho rhi hai, magar mere haath pair toh poore dard mein hain."
30,"Right. Okay. Okay. And you mentioned Jain voices, And I know you've spoken to doctors about them before. ",routine,208_30,T,crq,,"Thik. Thik. Thik. Aur tumne Jain awaaz ki baat ki, aur main jaanta hun tumne pehle unse baat ki hai."
31,Yeah,inactive,208_31,P,ack,,Arrey
32,"but can I just ask you a few more questions about and please, if that's okay. Okay, can you tell me? How long is it that you've been hearing the voices?",symp/reasoning,208_32,T,irq,,आप बस मुझे कुछ और सवाल पूछ सकते हैं और बस यह बता सकते हैं कि आपको सुनाई दे रही आवाज़ों से कब से पता है?
33,That since I was a teenager as well.,symp/reasoning,208_33,P,id,,Maine tabse hi kishor tha jabse.
34,"And do you know other is, how many voices are there or who they are?",symp/reasoning,208_34,T,irq,,"Aur kya tumhe pata hai ki, kitne awaaz hai ya unki pehchaan kya hai?"
35,I don't know who they are. It's mainly my stepdad.,symp/reasoning,208_35,P,id,,Mujhe nahi pata ki woh kaun hai. Yeh mainly mere stepdad hai.
36,Right.,inactive,208_36,T,ack,,Thik hai
37,He just tells me how dirty I am and right. How horrible I am.I don't know sometimes it's my mom as well.,routine,208_37,P,id,,Woh bas mujhe bata deta hai ki main kitna ganda hoon aur sahi hoon. Kitna bura hoon. Mujhe kabhi pata nahi hota ki kabhi kabhi yeh meri maa bhi hai.
38,What kind of things Does your mom say?,routine,208_38,T,irq,,Tumhari maa kya tarike se kehti ho?
39,I think maybe she says about things in my life.,routine,208_39,P,id,,"Mein sochta hoon, shayad woh meri zindagi ke bare mein keh rahi hai."
40,Right. Okay. And how often is it that you get these voices,symp/reasoning,208_40,T,irq,,Theek. Thik hai. Au Kitni baar tumhe yeh aawaazein milti hain?
41,"out there all the time Yeah, generally the sort of sitting there butAnd then you sometimes the louder than others and it's like the other night, the mice will have been in the room. ",symp/reasoning,208_41,P,id,,"Hinglish Translation:

Sahi mein, sab waqt vaha baitha rehta hai, jaise ki vaise hi vaha baithe hue rahte hai lekin kabhie kabhie toh zyada shor hota hai aur aise lagta hai jaise kal raat, chuho ne kamre mein reh liya."
42,Right. Did you think they were in the room?,symp/reasoning,208_42,T,irq,,Right. Kya tumhe lagta tha ki woh kamre mein hai?
43,"No, I mean, I know that they're not there But it's like they're just so loud in my head.",symp/reasoning,208_43,P,id,,"Nahi, matlab, mujhe pata hai ki woh wahin nahi hai Lekin mere dimaag mein woh bahut shor macha rahe hain."
44,So can I just clarify that other voices seem as though they're inside your head? Or was it like my voice coming through your ears?,routine,208_44,T,irq,,Kya main bas yeh saaf kar sakta hu ki kya aapke dimaag mein dusre awaaz aisi lag rahi hai jaise woh aapke andar se aa rahi ho? Ya yeh mere awaaz ka matlab tha jo aapke kaano se sunai diya tha?
45,"No. So inside inside your head, yeah",symp/reasoning,208_45,P,id,,"nai. So andar andar tera head, yeah"
46,okay. Okay. Okay. And am I right in thinking that they they trouble you more at times when you get stressed out?,symp/reasoning,208_46,T,yq,,Theek hai. Theek hai. Theek hai. Aur kya main sahi soch raha hu ki unhe jab aap stress mein aate hain tab aapko zyada pareshani hoti hai?
47,"Yeah, right. ",symp/reasoning,208_47,P,ack,,"Haan, thik hai."
48,"Okay. Okay. Can I ask you a few more general questions about how you are in your mood? How, how would you say that you, you feel generally kind of in yourself.",routine,208_48,T,irq,,Okay. Okay. Kya mai thode general sawaalon se pooch sakta hun ki tum khud mein kaisa mahsoos karte ho? Kya tum apne mood ke baare mein kahna chahoge ki tum generally kaisa mehsus karte ho?
49,"Most of the time, it's not just like being me.",routine,208_49,P,id,,"Aksar saare waqt, yeh mere jaisa nahi hota hai."
50,Sounds as it can be very difficult sometimes. It sounds like you've used cutting in the past to help are there any of the things that you do to help when you feel really bad.,routine,208_50,T,gc,,"Sometimes, it can be terribly difficult. It feels as if you've resorted to cutting in the past to cope. Are there any other things that you do to feel better when you're in a really bad state?"
51,"Drinking, smoke few spliffs now and then so much now, in the past I don't know, I just had a funny thing about food, you know it's all i binge and then just throw it back up again. ",symp/reasoning,208_51,P,gc,,"Peete peena, thodi si suttan pee lekin ab bahut zyada, pehle pata nahi, bas mujhe kuch chakkar khane ka tha, tu jaanta hai ki mai poori tarah se binge karta hoon phir usey upar phir se chod deta hoon."
52,"Okay, and that was in the past, but but not recently.",symp/reasoning,208_52,T,crq,,"ठीक है, और वह पहले की बात थी, लेकिन हाल ही में नहीं"
53,I haven't done it recently.,symp/reasoning,208_53,P,cd,,मैंने हाल ही में यह नही
54,"And can I ask Jane, it sounds like when you cook the other night, you were doing it, sort of to kind of get rid of the pain. Can I just clarify where you're doing it to try and kill yourself.",routine,208_54,T,yq,,"और जेन को मैं पूछ सकता हूँ, यह सुनने में आता है कि जब आप दूसरी रात खाना पका रहे थे, तो आप इसे ऐसे कर रहे थे, जैसे दर्द को स्वभाव से दूर करने की कोशिश करने के लिए। क्या मैं स्पष्ट कर सकता हूँ"
55,No.,routine,208_55,P,on,,Nahi.
56,Okay. Have there ever been times in the past when you have tried to kill yourself?,symp/reasoning,208_56,T,orq,,Theek hai. Kya aapse kisi pehle samay mein kabhi khud ko maarne ki koshish ki hai?
57,"late teens, then around when it was 19 I don't know. It just got to a point where I didn't want to be anymore. So I took some tablets",symp/reasoning,208_57,P,id,,"Late teens, fir 19 ho gaya tab mujhe pata nahi tha. Bas ek point tak pahunch gaya tha jab mai aur nahi rehna chahta tha. Isliye maine kuch tablet li."
58,So that was in your late teens and at the time you took the tablets because you wanted to be dead. Is that right?,symp/reasoning,208_58,T,crq,,Toh uss zamane tum aapke kishore kaal mein the aur tab aapne tablets liye kyunki tum mar jaana chahte the. Kya yeh sahi hai?
59,Yeah,inactive,208_59,P,ack,,Haan
60,"Okay. Okay, but you've not wanted to be dead since that time in your late teens? ",routine,208_60,T,yq,,"Theek hae. Haan, par tere late teens mein uss waqt se teri maut nahi hui thi?"
61,No.,routine,208_61,P,on,,Nahi.
62,Okay. Can I ask a few more general questions about your home situation? Who is it Is it is there anyone at home with you?,symp/reasoning,208_62,T,irq,,Thik hai. Kya mai aap ke ghar par aapke parivaar ke baare mein kuch aur sawaal puch sakta hun? Kaun hai woh? Kya ghar par koi aapke saath hai?
63,"Well my daughter used to live with me, okay But right now she is gone to live with her dad now",symp/reasoning,208_63,P,id,,"Well mere beti mere saath rehti thi, thik hai Lekin abhi woh apne pita ke saath rehne chali gayi hai"
64,Right? So she's gone to live with her dad that quite recently,routine,208_64,T,irq,,Sahi na? Toh usne apne dad ke saath rehne ko ji liya hai jo ki kafi haal hi mein hua hai.
65,a year ago,routine,208_65,P,id,,Ek saal pehle
66,and what was what was that about?,routine,208_66,T,irq,,Aur Woh kya tha?
67,she just couldn't cope with the fact that I was cutting myself might run into friends. She knew it was happening. And I suppose I suppose one of the big things as well as relationships I have,symp/reasoning,208_67,P,id,,"Uski bas is baat se samna kar nahi sakti thi ki main apne aap ko kaat rahi thi, dost se mil sakti hun. Usko ye pata tha ke ye ho raha hai. Aur I guess, ye ek badi baat hai mere rishto me."
68,the relationships you had?,routine,208_68,T,yq,,tere paas kya rishte the?
69,Hmm,routine,208_69,P,ack,,Hmm ह
70,Can you tell me a bit more about that?,symp/reasoning,208_70,T,irq,,Kya aap mujhe uske baare mein thoda aur bata sakte hain?
71,"Like the one we just had with Mark, you know, starts off being great. And then I got, I got really scared, really scared that they're gonna leave and then turns into a fights and they end up leaving anyway. ",symp/reasoning,208_71,P,id,,"Jaise humne Mark ke saath abhi-abhi kiya tha, tum jaante ho, shuru shuru mein bahut accha tha. Magar phir main dar gaya, bahut dar gaya ki woh jaane wale hain aur phir yeh jhagde mein badalta hai aur ant mein woh chale jaate hain anyway."
72,Right. And it sounds like your daughter struggled with that.,symp/reasoning,208_72,T,crq,,Right. Aur woh aisa lagta hai ki tumhari beti ko uske saath ladaai karni padi thi.
73,"Yeah, I mean, I suppose she didn't whether she was coming out going really",symp/reasoning,208_73,P,cd,,"Haan, main, main maanta hoon, mujhe lagta hai usse pata nahin tha ki woh nikalne ja rahi hai ya sach mein ja rahi hai"
74,"Okay. Well, there are lots of relationships like that. ",inactive,208_74,T,gc,,"Okay. Toh, aise bahut saare rishte hote hain."
75,Yeah.,inactive,208_75,P,ack,,Haan.
76,Okay. You've seen Jane a few people in the past you've seen a couple of psychiatrists and a couple of counselors. As anything that anyone's done for you before been particularly helpful.,symp/reasoning,208_76,T,gc,,"Thik hai. Tumne pichle kuchh logon ko Jane dekha hai, aur kuchh psychiatrists aur kuchh counselors bhi dekhe hain. Kya kisi ne tumhare liye koi kaam kiya hai jo sachmuch madadgaar raha ho?"
77,I've been crap was Philip being passed from pillar to post.,routine,208_77,P,gc,,"Main zumbeen crap tha, Philip ko yahan se wahan tak bheja ja raha tha."
78,So you've not found anything that people have done particularly helpful in helping you to manage your relationships and your cutting and the things that seem to go wrong for you.,symp/reasoning,208_78,T,crq,,So kya tumne kuchh bhi nahi paya hai jisme logon ne tumhari rishton aur tumhari dhadkhan ko sambhalne mein kafi madad ki ho aur woh cheezein bhi jo tumhare liye kharab lagti hai?
79,"Its llike nobody's listening to me, You know, I think you're the only person who's actually sat and listened to what I've got to say,",symp/reasoning,208_79,P,cd,,"ये तो ऐसे ही लगता है कि किसी को मेरी बात सुनाई नहीं दे रही है, तुम जानते हो, मुझे लगता है कि तुम ही वह व्यक्ति हो जो मे"
80,"what do you think it would be worse? Given that this this has been such a long standing problem clearly does get gets in the way, quite a lot of aspects of your life. Do you think it would be worth us? meeting again one more time, and perhaps having a think together about how the service could best support you with this?",routine,208_80,T,orq,,"Tum sochte ho ki yeh bura hoga? Ishki jo itni der se hai, issme kafi saare pahlu hai jo tumhari zindagi mein tang aa sakte hai. Kya tu sochta hai ki humare liye mehfooz hoga? Hum phir se ek baar milna chahiye, aur shayad ek saath yeh sochna chahiye ki hum tumhe isme se behtar se behtar kaise madad kar sakte hai?"
81,"What do you mean one more time? Can I see you, you know, properly. ",routine,208_81,P,crq,,"Kya tum ek aur baar keh rahe ho? Kya main tumhe dekh sakti hoon, tumhe pata hai, sahi tarike se."
82,"Well, the way that we work here in this department is that we we see people once or twice and try and think with them about the best place for them to be and then refer them on to the most appropriate parts of the service. So it wouldn't be usual for me to see. See you more than once or twice Strain",routine,208_82,T,cd,,"Hamara yahan kaam karne ka tarika ye hai ki hum log jis department mein kaam karte hain, usmein logon ko ek ya do baar dekhte hain aur unke saath unke liye sabse accha jagah sochne ki koshish karte hain aur phir unhein service ke sabse uchit part mein refer karte hain. Isliye aam baat nahi hai ki main aapko ek ya do baar se jyada dekhun. Aankh se aankh milana"
83,"Yeah like I said, You're the only person that's listened to me.",,208_83,P,od,,"Haan jaise maine kaha, tum hi wo ek vyakti ho jo mujhe suna hai."
84,I know it's very difficult to open up to people and I know that you have opened up here today and it can feel quite hard that you're not going to continue to see me but it is the way that we work here is to pass you on to somebody who is perhaps a bit more appropriate for your needs Jane. So would it be okay for me to book you in to come back and see me say next week for a second appointment and we can perhaps have a think of where to go from there.,routine,208_84,T,gc,,Mujhe pata hai ki logon se kholna bahut mushkil hota hai aur main jaanta hoon ki aapne aaj yahaan khol diya hai aur ye bahut mushkil ho sakta hai ki aap mujhe aage nahi dekhenge par hum yahaan isi tarah kaam karte hain ki aapko kisi aise vyakti se jod diya jaaye jo aapki zarurat ke liye shayad thoda zyada upyogi ho Jane. To kya mere liye aapko aane ke liye next week ki date book karne mein koi problem nahi hogi? Hum doosri appointment ke liye phir se mil sakte hain aur fir se soch sakte hain ki kahaan se aage badhna hai.
85,That'd be okay.,inactive,208_85,P,gc,,हो सकता है। (
