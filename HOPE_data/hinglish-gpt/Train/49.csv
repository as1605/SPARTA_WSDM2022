But I begin to yell caused a big commotion because I was so frustrated and angry. She actually was about to call the police escort me out. And I don't think I'm even allowed to go back to the driveway anymore.",story,49_6,P,id,,Main apne fiance ke uniforms ko pickup karne ke liye dry cleaner jata hu aur waha par lady ne use ball bag jaise ek saath bandh diya aur maine isse bahar nikalne ke liye use alag karne ke liye pucha toh woh mujhe police bula rahi thi.

Par, mujhe ab pachtavaa ho raha hai ki sab khatam ho gaya hai. Maine socha bhi hai. Lekin maine samajh nahi aaya ki mujhe kutte ki wajah se itna gussa kyu aaya tha."

I kind of just break down and just become extremely upset with everything around me.,symp/reasoning,49_13,P,on,,Kuchh nahi jo main sach mein soch sakta hun tabhi jab main overwhelmed ho jata hun. Mujhe bahut kuch karne ke liye hai. Main bas toot jata hun aur apne aspaas ke sab kuchh se bahut upset ho jata hun.
14,"Alright, so you're getting upset you have some anger",symp/reasoning,49_14,T,crq,,"Theek hai, tu upset ho raha hai kyunki tujhe gussa aa raha hai."
15,any other time that you're feeling angry,symp/reasoning,49_15,T,irq,,Agar aapko kabhi bhi gussa aaye to kisi aur waqt ho uss samay
16,when I go to the go workout at the kickboxing class I'm like the go all out like I use that as like a release. I'm punching the bags of shame before I actually had hurt my wrist last week. I just go all out in there and my trainer kind of notices like are you okay? And I'm like it's just relief kind of gained all the anger I had been out so.,story,49_16,P,id,,"Jab main go karne jaati hu go workout pe kickboxing class mein toh main waise hi go all out karti hu jaise main use kisi tarah ka release ki tarah se use karti hu.

Aur main khush hone lagti hu kyunki waha pe saara gussa jo mere andar tha, uska release ho jata hai."

Yahi wajah hai ki gussa badh raha hai."

So it's kind of like just feel overwhelmed, I guess not take it out.",symp/reasoning,49_21,P,cd,,"Mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe bahut pareshani ho rahi hai kyunki bahut saari chizon ke saath ghul mil gaya hai.

So",story,49_25,P,id,,Mujhe ghar ki dekhbhaal karne ka matlab ye nahi hai ki main kuch kaam nahi karta. Bas ghar ki dekhbhaal aur bachcho ke saath rehna bahut mushkil hai. Isliye mai ghar ki dekhbhaal karta hoon.
26,see a lot of responsibilities in the home.,routine,49_26,T,crq,,Ghar mein bahut saari zimmedariyaan dekhni hai.
27,Guess all of the responsibilities all,routine,49_27,P,cd,,Hinglish: Guess sabhi responsibilities?

Mujhe breakfast pakana sure karna tha mujhe lunch lena hai sure karna tha. Mujhe income ke liye dinner taiyaar karna tha aur baccho ki homework mein help karna tha. Meri zindagi mein itna kaam hai ki lagta hai jaise ki non-stop, catering, catering, catering, cater kar rahi hoon aur lagta hai ke mujhe break nahi mil raha hai aur koi madad bhi nahi mil rahi hai, har roz bas yahi kaam rehta hai."
32,You're doing everything and has always been this way.,routine,49_32,T,crq,,Tum sab kuch kar rahe ho aur hamesha se yahi hota hai.
33,Not always but it seems it's been like this for some time.,routine,49_33,P,cd,,"Not always, par yeh toh lagta hai ki yeh kaafi samay se aisa hi hai."
34,Okay. Where you're really just doing everything in the home.,routine,49_34,T,irq,,Achha. Jahan aap really ghar mein sab kuch kar rahe hain.
35,Everything.,inactive,49_35,P,id,,Sab kuch.
36,I want to ask you,routine,49_36,T,irq,,Mai tumse poochna chahta hu
37,"Can I ask you or mention a few words? Right? I would like you to, if you're okay with this exercise, tell me the first thing that comes to mind like and you can buy say a word, you can offer several responses. But try not to invest a lot of thought into the response more just what occurs to you. Oh, but does that make sense? ",story,49_37,T,irq,,"Kya mujhe kuch baat poochni ya kuch shabd batane ki ijazat hai? Sahi hai na? Agar aap is exercise se sehmat hai toh main aapse chahta hoon ki aap mujhe jo pehla khayal yaad aata hai voh bataye aur aap ek shabd bol sakte hai, aap kuch jawaab bhi de sakte hai. Lekin jyada soch kar jawaab dene ki koshish na karein, bas jo aapke dimaag mein aata hai voh batayein. Oh, lekin kya yeh samajh mein aata hai?"
38,Yeah.,routine,49_38,P,ack,,Haan.
39,All right. So the first word is,routine,49_39,T,irq,,Theek hai. Toh pehla shabd hai.

52,of constant struggle,routine,49_52,P,id,,लगातार जंग की
53,extremely controlling.,routine,49_53,P,id,,बहुत ही न
54,So do you see any,routine,49_54,T,irq,,So kya tu koi dekhta hai?
55,themes and in the words that you provided back,routine,49_55,T,irq,,themes aur tumhare dwara di gayi shabdo mein wapas milenge
56,Seems like everything is like really controlled and,routine,49_56,P,id,,Lagta hai sab kuch bahut zyada niyantrit aur controlled hai.
57,"structured, ",routine,49_57,P,id,,संर
58,controlled and structured?,routine,49_58,T,irq,,Niyantrit aur sehyoji?
59,What's the source of that controlling structure? Is there a source of it?,symp/reasoning,49_59,T,irq,,Ye controlling structure ka source kya hai? Kya iska source hai?
60,A lot of it may come from my fiance. Now that I'm thinking about it.,symp/reasoning,49_60,P,id,,Mujhe pata hai ki uska ek bada hissa shaayad mere pichhe se hai. Abki baar jab main soch rahi hoon tab.
61,"Somebody told me you're thinking,",routine,49_61,T,gc,,Kisi ne mujhe bataya ki tum soch rahe ho.
62,"because I feel that he doesn't give me the freedom or the ability to do a lot of the things that I would like to do like work, and I think he should help more with the kids around the house and do things and I shouldn't have to do everything. And I feel like that's probably why I'm so frustrated because I felt that I don't have any help. It's like I'm single, and I'm doing everything on my own. So this project where the bulk of my frustration is coming from",story,49_62,P,id,,"I am feeling like he is not allowing me to do many things that I want to do, like my job. He should be more involved in taking care of the children and household tasks. I should not have to do everything on my own. This is the main reason for my frustration. It's as if I am single and handling everything alone. This project is the source of most of my frustration."
63,So as you're telling me this and you're explaining kind of that relationship with your fiance What are you feeling?,routine,49_63,T,irq,,"Toh jaise aap mujhe ye bata rahe hain aur aap apne fiance ke saath ristey ki baat samjha rahe hain, aapko kya mehsoos ho raha hai?"
64,"I'm feeling angry and disappointed. Like I don't really know if I want to further anything because well it'd be like this forever just like angry, frustrated",symp/reasoning,49_64,P,id,,"Mujhe gussa aur nirash mahsus ho raha hai. Jaise main sach me jaanti hi nahi hu ki kya mai kuch aur aage badhana chahti hu kyunki pata nahi ye sab kab tak aise hi chalta rahega, gussa aur besabar hone ki tarah."
65,is a similar to the anger that you've been experiencing recently. Like at the dry cleaner places.,symp/reasoning,49_65,T,gc,,Yahaan ek anger hai jo aapko haal hi mein ho raha hai. Jaise dry cleaner places par.
66,It's far worse than it but it's like I think that's where why I'm always so upset and angry.,symp/reasoning,49_66,P,gc,,Yeh bahut bura hai par yeh mujhe usse bahut zyaada gussa dilata hai kyunki mujhe aisa lagta hai ki wahan hi woh sab hamesha pareshan aur gusse waale ho jaate hai.
67,Serious thinking that maybe that relationship or something part of that relationship is what's really causing the anger.,symp/reasoning,49_67,T,gc,,Shayad yeh soch vichar hai ki shayad uss rishte ya uss rishte ke kuch hisse mein hi narazgi paida ho rahi hai.
68,"Yeah, cuz I feel alone at the same time completely. Like I'm not in a fair relationship is like I'm in control and I don't have freedom to do anything. I don't have help and it's just it's laying a lot of stress on me.",symp/reasoning,49_68,P,gc,,"Haan, kyunki mujhe akela mahsoos hota hai aur saath hi poori tarah se bhi. Jaise ki main ek sahi rishte me nahi hu, jaise ki main apne aap par control me hu aur kuch bhi karne ki azadi nahi hai. Meri madad nahi hai aur bas yahi meri par bahut saari tanav hai."
69,So is this is your talk about this do you feel like this is new information you're kind of realizing something that you didn't realize before,symp/reasoning,49_69,T,crq,,Kya yeh tumhara is baare mein baat hai? Kya tumhe lagta hai ki yeh nayi jaankari hai? Kya tum samajh rahe ho ki tum pehle se nahi samjh rahe the?
70,"it because honestly, I kind of I never really focused on that aspect of it. I kind of just thought that's the way it should go. And I just thought I was angry because I just hate bad deeds. I've never really looked deep into it because I try so hard to make everything in my family, right. So I kind of really don't pay attention, I kind of ignore it. But now that I'm thinking and pointing out different things, than into how I really feel.",symp/reasoning,49_70,P,cd,,"Honesty sahai, maene jaise us aspect pe kabhi focused hi nahi kiya. Maene socha tha ki waise hi hona chahiye. Aur mujhe gussa aata tha kyunki mujhe bura kaam se nafrat hai. Mae kabhi us cheez ko gehre se dekhne ki koshish nahi ki kyunki maene apni family mein sabko sahi karne ki koshish ki. Isliye maene dhyaan nahi diya, maene usko ignore kiya. Lekin ab sochke aur alag alag cheezon ko batane pe, mujhe pata chal raha hai ki mujhe asal mein kaisa lagta hai."
71,"So you feel this, this kind of big moment in terms of awareness.",routine,49_71,T,crq,,"Toh aapko lagta hai, yeh, yeh awareness ke liye bada hi mahtva-purna pal hai."
72,"Definitely because I don't think I would have like I said, I think I'm kind of try to hide it and really don't focus much on it because I want things to be perfect. So they got a kind of ignore it.",story,49_72,P,cd,,"Pakka kyunki mujhe lagta nahi ki mujhe pasand aaya hoga, main samjh raha hu, mujhe chhipane ki koshish kar raha hu aur ispe zyada dhyan nahi de raha hu kyuki mujhe cheezon ko bilkul perfect banana hai. Isliye main thoda ignore kar raha hu."
73,"Okay, so maybe through this session, you develop more insight about what's contributing to the anger.",routine,49_73,T,orq,,"Okay, toh shayad is session ke zariye aap ko gussa mein kya kuch madad kar raha hai, is baare mein aur zyada samajh hone lagti hai."
74,"Yeah, definitely. Cuz I would just go off for no reason at all and just later to think about like, why did I even do it?",routine,49_74,P,od,,"Yeah, definitely hai. Kyuki main bilkul aise hi bina kisi wajah ke chale jaati thi aur baad me sochti thi ki, maine woh kyun kiya?"
75,"But But this source of anchor, this relationship, you recognize this is maybe more causal or more contributing? Yeah. Where's the other objects of your ad? If you weren't really sure,",routine,49_75,T,irq,,"Lekin lekin yeh anchor ka source, yeh rishta, tumhe samajh aata hai ki shayad yeh zyada causative ya zyada contribute karne wala hai? Haan. Tumhare ad ke doosre objects kahan hain? Agar tum bilkul sure nahi the,"
76,"I wasn't sure at all. Why. But with that, I definitely could see the reasons why.",routine,49_76,P,id,,"Main bilkul hi na sure tha. Kyu. Lekin iske saath, main bilkul woh wajah dekh sakta tha kyu."
77,"All right, chess move. I feel like we've made some progress here. And I'd like you to between now and next session, if you're comfortable with it, kind of reflect on what themes have maybe come to the surface, what informations may have been revealed to you a little bit. And we can pick up there and explore this further with the anger issue. So that's like a good plan.",story,49_77,T,gc,,"Thik hai, chess move. I feel ki we've made some progress here. Aur main chahta hoon ki tum ab aur agle session ke beech, agar tum comfortable ho toh, thoda sa socho ki kaun se vishay saamne aaye honge, aur tumhe kuch jaankari mile hogi. Phir hum wahan se shuru kar sakte hain aur anger issue ko aur explore kar sakte hain. Toh yeh ek accha plan hai."
78,"Yeah, definitely. Definitely. It's good.",inactive,49_78,P,ack,,"Haan, zaroor. Zaroor. Accha hai."
79,"Well, I appreciate you coming in today, and I'll see you in week. Okay. Thank you.",inactive,49_79,T,gt,,"Bhai, mujhe tere aaj aane ka bahut saara samman hai aur hum saath hai ek hafta mein. Okay. Dhanyavad."
