1,I've been working still on the fear of leaving the home for extended periods of time like vacation. And it's been a little harder recently because I have this plan trip with a friend of mine coming up in a few months and that's kind of been weighing on my mind.,symp/reasoning,64_1,P,gc,,"मैं घर छोड़कर लंबे समयों तक जैसे छुट्टियों के लिए काम कर रहा हूँ, लेकिन आज भी डर से काम कर रहा हूँ। और हाल ही में थोड़ा कठिन हो गया है क्योंकि मेरे एक दोस्त के साथ कुछ महीनों में यात्रा का प्लान है और उस बात से मेरे मन पर बोझ है।"
2,Whereas the trip to?,symp/reasoning,64_2,T,irq,,Yeh trip kahaan ki taraf ja raha hai?
3,Georgia,symp/reasoning,64_3,P,id,,"""ज"
4,how long way,symp/reasoning,64_4,T,irq,,Kitna lamba rasta hai?
5,"she wants to go like six days Yeah, I'm not sure with work and school and everything I can make the full six days and plus I'm a little nervous to go that long.",symp/reasoning,64_5,P,id,,"wo chahti hai ki wo chahe jao chahhate hain liye cheh din Haan, main kaam aur school ke saath poora chahe six din nahin bana sakta aur uske alawa main thoda ghabra aur lamba jana hai."
6,So that's a long time for you.,symp/reasoning,64_6,T,gc,,Toh yeh tumhare liye ek lamba samay hai.
7,It is yes.,symp/reasoning,64_7,P,gc,,Yeh hai.
8,So when did you discover this trip was going to be,symp/reasoning,64_8,T,irq,,So kab tak aapne yeh pata kiya ki yeh trip hone waala hai
9,"actually last Just a few days ago, she messaged me and said, Hey, you want to go with me and we'll go golfing and swimming. I love golfing. Like, I know I want to go. But I just had these just a little nervous about leaving",story,64_9,P,id,,"Actually last Just a few days ago, usne mere ko message kiya aur bola, Hey, tum mere saath aana chahte ho aur hum golf aur swimming par jaayenge. Main golf khelna bahut pasand karti hoon. Jaise, mujhe pata hai ki mujhe jana hai. Par bas mujhe thoda nervous lag raha hai jaane se."
10,"a little nervous? So when she made that call, ",symp/reasoning,64_10,T,irq,,"Kya tum thodi ghabraayi ho? To jab usne woh call kiya,"
11,"I was just a couple days ago, was the first thought he had kind of I can't go that long. That was my first thought. That's, that's too long. But he was like, wow, this would be great. I want to go down there golfing so bad and get away from the cold weather. So I mean, my immediate thought was no, not that long. But yes, I'm gonna go.",story,64_11,P,id,,"Main bus kuch din pahle hi, vah soch raha tha ki main itni lambi yatra nahi kar sakunga. Yeh meri sabse pehli soch thi. Yeh bahut lamba hai. Lekin vah soch raha tha, wow, yeh bahut achha hoga. Main vahan golf khelne jaana chahta hu aur sardi se door jana chahta hu. To mere man mein turant yahi vichar aaya ki nahi, itni lambi yatra nahi. Lekin haan, main jaa raha hu."
12,"Alright, so so to kind of conflicting thoughts, right. So one, one is like, never go that long, six days, way too long. And the other one is that would be enjoyable. You enjoy that? ",symp/reasoning,64_12,T,irq,,"Theek hai, toh aise thode se conflicting khyaal hain, samjhe? Toh ek, ek hai ki kabhi itni der tak nahi jaana chahiye, be hai lambe. Aur doosra hai ki mazedaar hoga. Kya tumko maza aayega?"
13,Absolutely.,symp/reasoning,64_13,P,ack,,पूर
14,Yeah. So which way you're leaning right now.,symp/reasoning,64_14,T,irq,,Haan. Toh abhi tum kis taraf ke rukh mein jaa rahe ho.
15,I want to go to go for six days. Maybe just like a long weekend,symp/reasoning,64_15,P,id,,Main chahata hu ke 6 din ke liye jaaun. Shayad bas ek lambi chutti ki tarah
16,"3, 4 days?",symp/reasoning,64_16,T,irq,,"Tin, 4 din?"
17,two would be ideal but the idea of it two three days Yeah.,symp/reasoning,64_17,P,id,,"Do teen dinon tak ideal hoga, lekin iski aisee vichaar kya hai ki do dinon ke baad, haan."
18,So what we think is causing this worry about being gone more than two days?,symp/reasoning,64_18,T,irq,,To hum sochte hain ki kya ye soch ka karan hai ki hum do din se zyada gayab hone ki chinta kar rahe hain?
19,"I don't know. I mean, I've always as a late teenager in my 20s I've always had just nervous to leave home I don't as much as I love being home I love to travel to and you know, do different things. It's just, I guess I'm just afraid something to happen when I'm not around.",story,64_19,P,id,,"Mujhe nahi pata. Main toh matlab hai, mai hamesha se ek late teenager se apni 20s mein bas ghabraati rehti thi ghar se jaane se. Mai ghar pe hona pasand karti hu magar ghoomne aur alag alag cheezein karne mein bhi maza aata hai. Bas, shayad mai bas is baat se darrti hu ki jab mai nahi hu tab kuch ho jaayega."
20,"Not to you're afraid something will happen to your, your house or,",story,64_20,T,crq,,"Kisi chinta mat karo, kuchh aapki ya aapke ghar ko ho jayega isse."
21,"well, I have pets so we're about them. My parents are getting older, so I worry about them. Mainly, like my immediate family, mainly, I guess my dad, because he's had a history of heart attacks and then my pets that's such as for something to happen, I will be there.",story,64_21,P,cd,,"Achha, maine pets rakhte hain, toh main unke baare mein chinta karta hoon. Meri maa-baap budhde ho rahe hain, isiliye main unki fikar karta hoon. Mostly, meri immediate family, mainly meri papa ke baare mein, kyunki unhe dil ke daurey ke kuch pehle bhi hue the, aur phir meri pets ke baare mein bhi, kyunki kuch ho gaya toh main wahan hoga."
22,"And how about when you were younger? You said this Problems found for was the same thing, the same thing. So mostly family and now some pets,",story,64_22,T,irq,,Aur tum bachpan mein jab tum chote they? Tumne kaha tha ki yeh Problem found yahi waise hi cheez thi. Toh zyadatar family aur ab kuchh paltu janwar.
23,my pets then to see if that's,story,64_23,P,id,,Mere pets tab dekhte hain ki kya vo hai.
24,"yes, your feelings are there fighting one another. Absolutely. And right now the feeling the thought anyway, have you know I would like to go on the trip. is winning But the fear thought was kind of dragging, dragging you down. Yeah. So what's the sensation of anxiety here?",story,64_24,T,irq,,"Haan, tere feelings ek doosre se lad rahe hain. Puri tarah se. Aur abhi jo feeling hai, woh soch se bhi zyaada powerful hai, tu jaan le ki mujhe trip pe jaane ka mann hai. Lekin darr ki soch thoda sa tere ko neeche kheechne ki koshish kar rahi thi. Haan. Toh yahaan tension ki feeling ka kya ahsaas hai?"
25,"Yeah, I get anxious. Yeah, my heart gets feels like it's heavy my chest feels heavy and I just all these thoughts go through my mind like, you know, I know my parents um I can watch my pets but they may not take care of them like I would I don't know it's just I mean that you know they've always will take care of all my no but they'll miss me and they might tear my house up I don't all these thoughts in my mind that seem crazy to me.",story,64_25,P,id,,"Haan, mujhe anxiety hoti hai. Mere dil ko bojh jesa lagta hai aur mere seene mein bhi bojh jesa lagta hai aur mere dimaag mein yeh saare khayal aate hai jaise, aap jaante hai, mere parents sab kuch sambhaal lenge par shayad meri tarah nahi, main nahi jaanti, bas yehi ki unhein meri kami mehsus hogi aur woh mere ghar ko kharab kar sakte hai, mere dimaag mein yeh sab khayal aate hai jo mujhe pagal sa lagte hai."
26,"So it seems like an endless stream of worries. Yeah. Surrounding family and pets. And what might happen. So really, that's that's it, right? This is what might happen. It's the uncertainty, right? So is anything ever happened?",story,64_26,T,irq,,"Toh aisa lagta hai ki yeh ek anant chintao ka dhaar hai. Haan. Apne parivaar aur paltu janwar se ghire hue. Aur kya ho sakta hai. Toh sach mein, yehi baat hai, thik hai? Yehi ho sakta hai. Yah anishchayta ka vishay hai, samjhe? Toh kya kabhi kuchh hua hai?"
27,"No, no",story,64_27,P,on,,"Nahi, nahi"
28,Okay. So so far all worrying. And anxiety really hasn't paid me dividends.,symp/reasoning,64_28,T,irq,,Thik hai. Ab tak sab chinta ka vishay tha. Aur anxiety sach mein mujhe koi fayda nahi diya hai.
29,"Yes. And now that I'm older when I was younger, I probably wouldn't like it overnight. But now that I'm older yes, I do I just say, I got to live my life and they'll be okay. I just try to tell myself they're in good hands. If something happens somebody Oh, call me but then I feel like oh, but I want to be hours away. I'm a plane ride away. And then I get thinking about that, but I do go. ",story,64_29,P,id,,"Haan. Aur ab ki mai bada ho gaya hun jab mai chota tha, shayad mujhe raat bhar yeh pasand nahi hota. Lekin ab ki mai bada ho gaya hun, haan, main toh bas yahi kehta hun, mujhe apni zindagi jeezna hai aur sab theek ho jayega. Mai khud ko samjhane ki koshish karta hun ki vo achhe haathon mein hai. Agar kuch bhi ho jata hai toh koi mujhe call kar dega lekin fir bhi mai sochta hun ki mai door kitni ghante hoon. Mai ek plane ride ki doori par hoon. Fir mai uske bare mein sochne lag jata hun, lekin mujhe jaana zaruri hai."
30,But you didn't in the past,routine,64_30,T,crq,,Lekin tumne peechle mein nahi kiya
31,no,routine,64_31,P,on,,nahee
32,So something changed. What changed?,routine,64_32,T,irq,,Kuchh to badal gaya. Kya badal gaya?
33,I don't know.I really,routine,64_33,P,on,,Mujhe nahi pata. Main sach me.
34,"right? So not sure what change but used to not go, now you do go. So when you're down there, or wherever you go in the trip, you're feeling better, like you're enjoying yourself. But you're also worried at the same time.",story,64_34,T,irq,,"Sahi na? Toh doubtful hun ki kya change hua hai par pehle jaaneka nahi jata tha, ab jaata hai. Isliye jab tu wahaan neeche hai, ya trip par kahi jaaye, tab tujhe badiya lagta hai, jaise ki tu maza le raha hai. Par saath hi saath, chinta bhi hoti hai."
35,"Not too well. Once I get there, I'm usually okay. Maybe the first night I get a little worried. And then maybe when I'm getting ready to come home, I'm like a little anxious, I'm ready to get home to make sure everything's okay.",story,64_35,P,id,,"Thoda sa theek nahi. Jab tak main wahin pahuch jaati hoon, main aam taur par theek hoon. Shayad pehli raat thodi chinta hoti hai mujhe. Aur phir ghar jaane ka waqt aa jaata hai, tab thodi pareshani hoti hai, ghar jaakar sab kuch theek hona dekhne ke liye."
36,And the rest of the time.,routine,64_36,T,irq,,Aur baaki ke samay.
37,"I'm usually Okay. I'll get some alcohol involved. So he kind of limits my anxiety. But once I get into like playing the golf and all that, I really do allow myself to enjoy it. It's just it seems like it's going and coming. That's",story,64_37,P,id,,"Mai usually thik thak hu. Mai kuch alcohol pee leta hu. Isliye wo thoda meri chinta ko kam karta hai. Magar jab mai golf khelne lagta hu, tab mai khud ko maje lene ki anumati deta hu. Bas aisa lagta hai ki wo ja raha hai aur fir wapas aa raha hai. Ye to aam baat hai."
38,"alright, so the problem really isn't when you're there. The problem is now leading up to it and maybe just the first half day, your day when you're there, and maybe the last half day or two there.",symp/reasoning,64_38,T,gc,,"Theek hai, toh problem bilkul jab tum waha ho, koi nahi hai. Problem hai ab uske pehle aur shayad bas pahla aadh din, jab tum waha ho, aur shayad baaki aadh din ya do din tak."
39,"It's like a plane. Like I don't have a problem, right, like flying out. But it's the thinking like, while I'm waiting for the plane like, Whoa, what if we What if a terrorist is on there? What if we crash? I'll think about all that before, but once I'm there and on the plane is right, take off. I'm fine. I'm completely fine. not anxious. It's leading up to the actual event that makes me anxious.",story,64_39,P,id,,"Itna plane jaisa hai. Jaise mujhe koi samasya nahi hai, thik hai, udhar jaane mein, par sochne hai jaise ki, main plane ke liye intezaar kar raha hun, oh bhai, kya agar hum se plane mein ek aatankwadi hoga? Kya agar hum plane se gir jayenge? Main sabse pahle sab kuch sochta hun, par ek baar wahan pahunch ke plane pe hoon, sab thik hai. Main bilkul thik hun. Chinta nahi hai. Par sacchai ke paas pauchne se pehle mujhe chinta hoti hai."
40,"I suppose anticipation. So that's that's the worst part. All right, so the period between now when you leave, it's gonna be the worst part. ",symp/reasoning,64_40,T,od,,"मुझे आन्तरिता का अनुमान होता है। तो वैसे तो यह न की यह सबसे खराब हिस्सा है। हाँ, इसलिए बात हुई कि अभी जब तुम ना चलोगे, तो उ"
41,"Yes, ",symp/reasoning,64_41,P,ack,,"Haan,"
42,but she'll probably stock up.,routine,64_42,T,gc,,Lekin wah stock kar legegi.
43,Probably. But I'll have changed my mind probably a dozen times before actually say yes.,routine,64_43,P,gc,,Shayad. Par mujhe ek do baar haan bole se pehle shayad main apna decision badal lungi.
44,And when you do go on Twitter.,routine,64_44,T,irq,,Aur jab aap Twitter pe jayein.
45,Yeah.,routine,64_45,P,ack,,Haan.
46,something could happen. Certainly sure. But it Hasn't so far,routine,64_46,T,irq,,Kuch to ho sakta hai. Zaroori nahi ki ho. Par iss waqt tak nahi hua hai.
47,I don't know. I try not to think that for,routine,64_47,P,on,,Mujhe nahi pata. Main uss baare mein sochne ki koshish nahi karta.
48,"alright, so you'll, you'll return?",routine,64_48,T,yq,,"thik hai, toh tum wapas aaoge?"
49,Yeah. Still doesn't stop me from worrying when I get these trips planned.,routine,64_49,P,id,,Haan. Par mujhe chinta karne se rokta nahi jab mujhe ye trips plan karna padhta hai.
50,"Yeah, so the probabilities of it really doesn't. That doesn't alleviate the Worry, worry still there. Right. Even though you know the worry is probably going to transition to enjoyment and looking forward to that that doesn't ",story,64_50,T,irq,,"Haan, toh uski probabilities se sach mein koi farak nahi padta. Worry ko kam nahi karta, wo abhi bhi wahi hai. Sahi hai. Waise bhi, tumhe pata hai ki wo worry anand ke taraf badal jayegi aur hum uske anand ki taraf umeed kar rahe hain, lekin wo bhi abhi nahi."
51,No not at all,story,64_51,P,on,,Nahi bilkul bhi nahi
52,that doesn't leave anything at all.,routine,64_52,T,irq,,wo kuchh bhi nahi chhodta.
53,like I gotta get my house cleaned up and make sure my animals or everyday have enough food and I preparing to leave.,story,64_53,P,id,,Mujhe apna ghar saaf karna hai aur apni animals ke liye har roz kaafi khana taiyaar karna hai aur main tayyar ho rahi hu apne jana ke liye.
54,"Preparing is productive, right? Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Well, how would the thoughts see you feel more connected to the warring?",routine,64_54,T,irq,,"Preparing karna productive hai, na? Haan, wo toh samajh mein aata hai. Haan. Toh, tumhe yeh mehsoos hone lagega ki tum ladai se zyada jude hue ho?"
55,"Probably like, like, I want to, I want to say, I don't know I really it's kind of a word. Like I want to, like I can't say bye Not to my parents or I can't, you know, say bye enough to my pets like I feel like I like I don't I don't know, I don't really care. That's, I guess part of the problem. I don't know what I'm connecting it to.",story,64_55,P,id,,"Probably jaise, jaise, main chahati hoon ki, main kahna chahati hoon, mujhe pata nahi main sachme ek shabd ki tarah. Jaise main chahati hoon, jaise main apne parents ko bye nahi keh sakti ya phir main apne pets ko bye nahi keh sakti, mujhe lagta hai main jaise hi main nahi janti ki main ise kya jod rahi hoon."
56,So if you don't tell them goodbye enough time.,routine,64_56,T,gc,,"""So agar tum unhe kafi baar goodbye nahi bolo toh."""
57,"Yeah, I don't know, maybe I sound so.",routine,64_57,P,ack,,"Haan, mujhe pata nahin, shayad main aise hi lagta hoon."
58,"Oh, it sounds like maybe if you don't say if you don't say goodbye enough times and settled that, that you'll feel guilty if something happens maybe that you regret it ",story,64_58,T,od,,"Arre, yeh sunne mein lagta hai ki agar tu goodbye nahi bole toh, agar tu settle na kar, toh ho sakta hai ki kuch ho jaaye aur phir tu khud ko dosh dena chahega."
59,maybe.,routine,64_59,P,ack,,ho sakta hai
60,so that so that's the focal point of this thing's night in some way. Right?,routine,64_60,T,yq,,Isliye is cheez ki raath ka mukhya kendro mein se hai. Sahi hai na?
61,Let me go for a few days.,routine,64_61,P,gc,,मुझे कुछ दिनों के लिए जाने दो। (Muj
62,And the way you start to let go is when you tell them,routine,64_62,T,crq,,"And jab tum unko bolte ho, tab shuru hone lagti hai tumhari chhutti."
63,Yeah.,routine,64_63,P,ack,,Haan.
64,So So what do you find yourself doing? You say goodbye and then then leave and then come back? Or,routine,64_64,T,irq,,Tu kya aise hi karta rehta hai? Tu alvida kehke chala jaata hai aur phir laut ke aata hai? Ya fir...
65,"do I just finally say, bye? I'll talk to you later love you. You know, I'll check in when I land or whatever and then that's it. Then it's like, I just have to try to breathe and just put those thoughts behind me. Because once I say it, it's like, Okay, that's it. I'm gone.",story,64_65,P,id,,"kya main bas finally bye boloon? main baad mein baat kar loon tumse jaanta hoon. main jab bhi utroon tumse zaroor baat karoonga. iske baad, bas main saans le kar uske khayal ko peeche chhod doon. kyunki jab main bol doon, bas, wohi hai. main chala gaya."
66,"But you're but your thoughts are still coming thoughts are still come in and say, You should have said, goodbye one more time.",story,64_66,T,gc,,"Par tum toh par tumhara khayal ab bhi aa raha hai aur kehte hue aate hue, Tumhe ek aur baar alvida kehna chahiye tha."
67,No. I just know that doesn't come to my mind,routine,64_67,P,gc,,Nahi. Mujhe bas pata hai ki yeh mere dimaag mein nahi aata.
68,that you didn't say goodbye well enough.,routine,64_68,T,gc,,जो तुमने अच्छी तरह से अलविदा नही
69,I don't know.,routine,64_69,P,gc,,मुझे नहीं पता ह
70,The property was the property of saying goodbye. This you feel like you're not doing well enough.,routine,64_70,T,gc,,यह प्रॉपर्टी विदाई बोलने की प्रत्यक्ष होती थी। इससे आपको वैसा महसूस होता है कि आप ठीक से
71,"Maybe it's just the fact that I'm leaving. I shouldn't leave. say that, you know, maybe I feel like I maybe it's just the guilt of leaving.",story,64_71,P,gc,,"Shayad ye keval ye baat hai ki main ja raha hoon. Main nahi jaana chahiye. Keh do, pata hai, sayad mujhe lagta hai ki shayad ye sirf jaane ka dosh hai."
72,So the act of leaving itself Leave shoot guilty. And what are you guilty of?,routine,64_72,T,irq,,To chhodna ka kaam khud hi Leave shoot gunehgaar hai. Aur tum gunehgaar kya ho?
73,Not being there if something happens.,routine,64_73,P,id,,Kuch ho jaye toh wahan na hona.
74,So abandon,routine,64_74,T,gc,,Toh chhoddena
75,maybe,routine,64_75,P,gc,,Shayad.
76,for a short time neglecting them for a short time.,routine,64_76,T,gc,,कम समय के लिए उन्हें अनदेखा कर दें। कम समय तक उन्ह
77,Probably maybe I did feel a little guilty.,routine,64_77,P,gc,,Shayad maine thoda sa dosh mahsus kiya.
78,And now you're in more of a caregiver role than you were then.,routine,64_78,T,od,,"Aur ab tum adhik se adhik ek caregiver ka role nibha rahe ho, tab tum usse pehle se zyada."
79,"Maybe a little bit I mean, I've always been. I'm the youngest of mine, me and my sister, but my parents have always looked up to me to be the responsible one and make sure everything's taken care of so I probably kind of loud myself. To take on that role of the caregiver moreso or be at the more responsible one of the two.",story,64_79,P,id,,"शायद थोड़ा -सा मैं मतलब है कि, मैं हमेशा रहा हूँ। मैं मेरे दोनों बहनों में सबसे छोटी हूँ, लेकिन मेरे माता-पिता हमेशा मुझे जिम्मेदार शख्स के रूप में देखते रहे हैं और सब कुछ संभालने के लिए देखते रहे हैं, तो शायद मैं अपने आप को थोड़ा ज्यादा बढ़ा चढ़ा के दिखाती हूँ। संभालने वाले के रूप में उस जिम्मेदारी को लेने के लिए या दोन"
80,"So to be the responsible one, there needs to be guilt when you leave, I guess",routine,64_80,T,crq,,"Toh zimmedari nibhane ke liye, jab tum chale jate ho toh afsos bhi hona chahiye, main sochta hu."
81,"maybe I should stay home and be responsible person and they don't make me feel guilty. They say go have a good time. Your baby's ugly. Okay, we'll take care of what I mean. I know they're in good hands. That's that's what's makes it so difficult. I know they'll be okay. But I just feel like a probably shouldn't go.",story,64_81,P,cd,,"Shayad main ghar par rehkar zimedaar aadmi banna chahiye aur ve mujhe apatti nahi hone denge. Ve kehte hai jaake mazze karo. Tumhara baby ugly hai. Theek hai, hum dekh lenge jo main keh raha hu. Mujhe pata hai ki ve surakshit haathon me hai. Yehi baat mushkil banati hai. Mujhe pata hai ki unhe kuch nahi hoga. Par main bas yeh mehsoos kar raha hu ki mai shayad ja na chahiye."
82,So there's not another person driving the skill towards you. That's me. Just coming in from the side.,routine,64_82,T,yq,,Toh koi aur driver nahin hai jo tumhari taraf yeh skill leke ja raha hai. Woh main hun. Sirf taraf se aa raha hun.
83,Yeah.,inactive,64_83,P,ack,,Haan.
84,"So if I, if I leave, well, I'm responsible. And if I leave, something bad will happen. And that'll be on me.",routine,64_84,T,crq,,"So agar main, agar main chhod du, toh main zimmedar hoon. Aur agar main chhod du, kuchh bura ho jayega. Aur woh mere upar hoga."
85,"Now when they're to fix it, or take care of it or make it better, like I put it on somebody else that have to do with that. Yeah.",routine,64_85,P,cd,,"अब जब वे उसे ठीक करने या उसका ध्यान रखने या उसे बेहतर बनाने के लिए हो रहे हों, तो मैं उसे किसी दूसरे को सौंप देता हूँ जो उससे संबंधित है। हाँ।"
86,So fear of being caught as irresponsible.,routine,64_86,T,crq,,Aise dar hai ki avyavaharik hote samjha jaye.
87,Maybe Yeah.,inactive,64_87,P,cd,,Maybe Haan.
88,"And you could be a few left to just take you a day's travel or whatever, however far away. ",routine,64_88,T,crq,,"Aur tum sirf kuchh door tak aa sakte ho, bas ek din ki yatra mein, ya jo bhi ho, kitni hi door tak."
89,Yeah.,inactive,64_89,P,cd,,Haan.
90,"Right. So yeah, but that's that's still doesn't help relieve anxiety now when you come back, because ",routine,64_90,T,irq,,"Thik ho. Haan, par wo ab bhi teri chinta ko kam nahi karta jab tu wapas aata hai, kyunki"
91,"no, not really. Because it's like, I want immediate access. Like, I want to be able to be right there within minutes if they need me.",story,64_91,P,id,,"नहीं, बिल्कुल नहीं। क्योंकि ये ऐसा है, मुझे तुरंत पहुँच चाहिए। जैसे कि, मुझे मिनटों के भीतर ही उस जगह पर होना चाहिए जहाँ वे मेरी जर"
92,Have you ever taken a trip that was like within,routine,64_92,T,irq,,क्या आपने कभी ऐसा ट्रिप किया है जो आपको अंदर से ही
93,"I mean, not it's not as bad but yeah, there's back there. Stay with us. For an overnight there's some of the way up sometimes I'm thinking I should just stay home. Or I could be right in the same town sometimes that if I'm, I wake up at five in the morning, I just get up and go home because I just get really start feeling really anxious and I want to be home.",story,64_93,P,id,,"Mera matlab ye hai, ki thoda sa galat nahi par haan, wahan piche hai. Humare saath raho. Raaton ko bhi kuch raasta upar hai aur kabhi kabhi main sochti hu ki ghar hi rah sakti hu. Ya phir main wahi sheher me hu kabhi kabhi agar main paanch baje subah uthu toh bas ghar jaake so jati hu kyunki mujhe bohot ghabrahat hone lagti hai aur ghar pe hona chahti hu."

I know that's, that appears to be causing more anxiety than thinking the worst But you have more chances? Well, one way you have more chances to test out these step responses at work because it's more or less a daily thing, right? five days a week, or whatever it is. So some of those adaptive responses that we kind of worked on together, right? You could apply those. And you know, think about that the responses are not always short. Right? The automatic thoughts could be short. It can even be images, do not necessarily even complete sentences, right? Like maybe have an image of your cat in an unfortunate situation. So it's not necessarily spelled out in English, like a sentence, but adaptive responses. Well, they could be images too, but the ones I'm talking about are really sentences that you're repeating back consciously to yourself. So it's important to have them prepared and ready to go. So I often ask clients To kind of write them out and have them available. So that when that thought comes about, and it seems like you're pretty good at identifying, you know, what thoughts are triggering anxiety you would read eventually would have to read because you've memorized initially you'd read the automatic thought I mean, the upside of the adaptive response and that would counter the deal on that thought. Okay, might not the first time might not the second time but over time we believe it and I found that it changes how often and how intense to aback thoughts come in. Conscious thinking, adaptive responding, does that make sense?",story,64_160,T,id,,"Toh apne practical behaviors implement kar rahe hai jo ki kaam me kaam aate hai aur isse humne house ko surakshit banane me bhi kaam kiya hai aur unhe plants se dur rakha hai. Isliye main sochta hu ki agar aapko theek lagta hai toh yaha par ek raasta hai ki hum work ko pehle point ke roop me istemal kare, main jaanta hu ki aapke paas trip hai, jo ki darr se jyada hai, lekin kya aapko zyada chances hai? Ek tareeka hai ki aap work me in step responses ko test karne ke liye jyada chances hai kyuki wo rozana ka kaam hai, saath hi adaptive responses bhi hai jo humne saath me kaam kiye hai, unhe apply kar sakte hai. Aur yaad rakhein ki responses hamesha chote nahi hote, automatic thoughts chote ho sakte hai, images bhi ho sakte hai, wo humesha poore sentences nahi hote, shayad aapke paas kisi bhayanak halat me apke cat ki image ho. Toh ye English ke complete sentences nahi hai, lekin adaptive responses hai. Aur mein baat kar raha hu wo sentences jo aap khud ko conscious tarike se repeat kar rahe hai, isliye unhe tayyar rakhna aur haath me rakhna bahut zaruri hai. Main apne clients ko aksar likhne ke liye kaha karta hu aur unko available rakhte hai, taaki jab wo thought aaye, aap usse identify karne me kaafi acche ho, ki konsi soch aapko anxiety de rahi hai, usme eventually aapko padhna padega kyuki initially aap yaad kar rahe hai, phir aap automatic thought padhenge, matlab adaptive response aur usse aap wo thought ko counten kar paoge. Theek ho sakta hai pehli baar nahi, doosri baar nahi lekin dheere dheere toh hum uspe yakeen karenge aur maine dekha hai ki isse back thoughts aana aur wo kitne intense hai, wo badal jate hai. Conscious thinking aur adaptive responding, kya ye sahi lagta hai?"
161,"That's us. Because like I said, I kind of said these things to myself anyway, I just didn't realize that's what was probably lessening the anxiety because I do say that things those things to myself pretty frequently when I say I have to go to work, or else you guys won't be able to take care of didn't even dawned on me that that's",routine,64_161,P,gc,,"Voh hum hai. Kyunki jaisa maine kaha tha, main khud hi in baaton ko bolta tha, bas mujhe pata nahi tha ki yeh hi cheezein anxiety ko kam karne mein help karti thi kyunki mai apne aap se kaafi baar yeh hi kehta hun jab mujhe kaam par jaana hota hai, nahi toh tum log meri achhe se dekhbhaal nahi kar paoge. Mujhe kabhi pata hi nahi chala ki yeh hi hai."
162,"you've already adapted Yeah, you've already used cognitive behavioral techniques, in a way to reduce anxiety. So what we're really doing is just expanding and formalizing what you've already been doing to achieve some success.",routine,64_162,T,orq,,"Tumne already adapt kar liya hai Haan, tumne already cognitive behavioral techniques ka istemaal kiya hai, ek tarah se anxiety ko kam karne ke liye. Isliye hum kya kar rahe hain, bas tumhare iss safal hone ke liye jo kaam tum pehle se kar rahe the usko badhane aur formalize kar rahe hain."
163,"That makes sense. Definitely, yes.",routine,64_163,P,ack,,"Ye baat samajh me aati hai. Zaroor, haan."
164,"So, if you could, between now and next session, write down some of the adaptive responses that we discussed the ones you've already used and, and then work to identify the automatic thoughts at work, and then come up, work to identify them, and then consciously repeat those, those that the responses back when you have those thoughts, okay, so you're really repairing self talk, adaptive responses, with the automatic thoughts, that thought comes right? And then you have the adaptive response. And you're repeating it, you know, it's an internal, you're pitting and just thinking it unnecessarily odds out loud, although, that would surely be okay to not know, your coworkers, you know, respond something like that.",story,64_164,T,gc,,"""So, agar tum kar sakte ho, abhi aur agla session ke beech mein, kuch samay ke liye vichar likho adaptive pratikriyaon ke, jinhe humne discuss kiya hai jo pehle se hi aapne istemaal kiya hai, phir unhe pehchaan ne ki koshish karo aur phir usme se unhe pehchan kar, unhe jaan boojh kar dohrana, theek hai, toh tum apni khud se baat, adaptive pratikriyaaon ke saath, us automatic vicharon se mein theek kar rahe ho, wahi soch aati hai na? Aur phir tumhe adaptive pratikriya mil jati hai. Aur tum usee dohra rahe ho, yaani ke, aapke mann mein, halki se aawaz se, chaahe aap jaane anjaane mein soch rahe ho, lekin, woh zaroor theek hai, apne saathpanno se nahi puchna, tumhare colleagues, kuchh aisa hi uttar denge."""

So I can like, there's a thing you can, you can remote access to your house, and there's a button your animal can push and call you. And I've talked to him at work. I'm like, Well, my cat calls me y'all. I really thought about it seriously, that I could check one that would lessen my anxiety would have to go home, I could just look in and see what they're doing. I have thought that some of my co workers know I can't worry about them. So yeah, they would help support me and not be so anxious.

172,"Yeah. So you know, maybe like a one to 10 with 10 being the worst, okay, and measure it when you first had that experience of it. I'm pretty sure you can measure fairly accurately, you've experienced it for a long time. You suffer with it for a long time. And then after applying the adapter response, especially after a few minutes, applying a few times, maybe shoot for ones, see what it is that and note that, again, the beginning of might not see much of a change at all. Right? So be persistent with it. Okay. Give it a chance to work and see how it does. Okay. We'll start there and we'll kind of review how you do that. And then we'll work toward the things Analyze the bigger stressor right? And we'll see what we can do in terms of planning adaptive responses for that. Okay. So a good plan. Yes.",story,64_172,T,gc,,"Haan. Toh tujhe pata hai, shayad ek se 10 tak scale hai, theek hai, aur usko measure karle jab tum pehli baar uss experience ka hui thi.
