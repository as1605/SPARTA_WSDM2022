1,I want to completely cut out fast food. I want to have more set meals and I just want to eat healthy food. Okay.,symp/reasoning,1_1,P,id,,Main to fast food ko puri tarah se ignore karna chahta hoon. Mujhe zyada fixed meals chahiye aur main bas sehatmand khana khana chahta hoon. Thik hai.
2,I think I at least needs to go to the grocery. Okay. ,symp/reasoning,1_2,P,id,,Mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe kam se kam grocery store jaana hoga. Theek hai.
3,Is that something that you haven't been doing?,routine,1_3,T,irq,,Kya yeh woh kuch hai jo tumhare dwaara abhi tak nahi kiya gaya hai?
4,"No, not lately. I've just been grabbing food at work, or going through fast food on the way home. Okay.",routine,1_4,P,id,,"Nahi, abhi abhi nahi. Office mein sirf khana khane ka bahana bana rahi hu ya phir ghar jaate waqt fast food pe chaa jati hu. Theek hai."
5,"Like, I just haven't had the energy or desire to go and I've also been been working a lot trying to save up money for the baby. Finding the time might be hard. Okay,",routine,1_5,P,id,,"Bhai, maine bus itna energy ya ichha nahi hui hai ki main jaau aur maine bhot kaam bhi kiya hai, bachche ke liye paise bachane ki koshish kar karke. Waqt nikalna thoda mushkil lag sakta hai. Thik hai."
6,"I used to go every week on Sunday. And I used to already have a list in mind before I went,",routine,1_6,P,id,,"Main hamesha har Sunday chale jaya karta tha. Aur pehle se hi meri list banke taiyaar hoti thi, tab main jaata tha."
7,That would probably make it more likely for me to go. I don't have to be at work until the afternoon that day. So I can maybe go asleep and a little bit maybe at like 10 o'clock on Sunday.,routine,1_7,P,id,,शायद वह मुझे जाने के लिए अधिक संभावित बना देगा। मुझे काम पर शाम को ही होने की ज़रूरत नहीं है उस दिन। इसलिए मैं शायद दोपहर तक सो सकता हूं और शायद दोपहर के 10 बजे तक मेरे लिए थोड़ी नींद आ सकती है।
8,"Well, lately when I haven't felt like doing things that I really need to do, I'll give myself a reward. And I know that there's this great bakery on the way. So if I tell myself, if I go to the grocery, then I can stop by the bakery on the way home, then I may be more likely to go.",symp/reasoning,1_8,P,id,,"चलो, हाल ही में जब मुझे वो काम करने की ज़रूरत होती है लेकिन मन नहीं करता, तो मैं अपने आप को इनाम देता हूँ। और मुझे मालूम है कि रास्ते में एक बहुत अच्छा बेकरी है। तो अगर मैं खुद को बोलूं कि अगर मैं ग्रोसरी स्टोर जाऊं तो होमवार्ड जाते समय उस बेकरी पर रुक सकता हूँ, तो मेरे काम को करने जाने की संभावना बढ़ सकती हैं।"
