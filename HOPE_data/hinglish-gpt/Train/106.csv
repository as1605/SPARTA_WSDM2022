3,"alcohol and marijuana. How recently was this DUI? About a week ago? Okay, so what's been going on when that happened?",symp/reasoning,106_3,T,irq,,"Sharab aur marijuana. Yeh DUI kab hua tha? Lagbhag ek hafte pehle? Theek hai, to tab kya ho raha tha?"
4,"Um, well, I am going to have to go to courtsoon. And I know that I'm probably gonna have to go I'd like treatment or something like that, but I really just don't want to. So I just, I'm just coming here becauseI don't know maybe I can like get out of it if I'm gettingsome type of treatment. But yeah,",symp/reasoning,106_4,P,id,,"Umm, well, mujhe court jaane ke liye jaana padega kuch samay mein. Aur main jaanta hoon ki mujhe shayad ilaaj ke liye jaana hoga ya kuch aisa hi, par main sach mein nahin chahta. Toh main yahan aaya hu kyunki mujhe yeh nahi pata ki agar mai koi tarika dhund ke nikal jaau. Par haan,"
5,get out of it. You mean get out of the charge?,routine,106_5,T,crq,,Iska hamse nikal ja. Tumhara matlab hai ki charges se bahar nikalo?
6,"Yeah. I mean, I feel like they're probably gonna make me like go to like rehab or something like that. And I don't want to do that.",routine,106_6,P,cd,,"Haan. Mera matlab hai, mujhe lagta hai ki unka udeshya ho sakta hai ki woh mujhe rehab mein bhej denge ya kuch aisa. Aur main woh nahi karna chahta."
7,So you feel like you can get out of the rehab or two.,routine,106_7,T,orq,,Tumhe lagta hai ki tum rehab se ya to aage badh sakte ho ya do se.
8,I don't know. I really am not sure.,inactive,106_8,P,od,,Mujhe nahi pata. Main sach mein yaqeen nahi rakhta.
9,"So at this recent arrest, you realize it may be a value to stop using which really don't want to Yeah, stuck there.",routine,106_9,T,yq,,"Is recent arrest mein toh tumhe samajh aa gaya hoga ki yeh ek achcha mauka hai ki hum woh cheezein band karein jo hum karna bilkul bhi nahi chahte. Haan, wahan fas gaye the."
10,Yeah kind of,inactive,106_10,P,op,,haan thoda sa
11,when you drink Do you ever socialize the same time?,routine,106_11,T,yq,,क्या आप पीते हुए कभी समय पर सामाजिक संवाद करते ह
12,I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like at my house,routine,106_12,P,id,,I mean kabhi-kabhi main bars jaake aur waise hi cheezon mein jaata hu par adhiktar time toh bas apne ghar mein rehta hu
13,alone so do the marijuana,routine,106_13,T,crq,,अकेले हो तो मैरीजुआ
14,yeah I mean I like a few people that are like smoke with but usually just kind of like by myself and myself every day so it was with people,routine,106_14,P,cd,,"Haan main toh kuch logon ko pasand karta hoon jo shisha saath karte hain, lekin aam taur par main apne aap ko pasand karta hoon aur har din apne aap ke saath hota hoon, isliye logon ke saath hota tha."
15,so it doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using now early sweetie losing,symp/reasoning,106_15,T,id,,"So it na lagta hai jaise tum sach mein chinta kar rahe ho ki agar abhi aap istemal karna chhod do toh tumhara social support kho sakte ho, pyaari."
16,um this this alcohol and I want to take it for pain relief qualities Yeah. ,symp/reasoning,106_16,P,id,,ये alcohol है और मुझे इसे दर्द से राहत प्रदान करने के लिए लेना है। नोनसेंस
17,Any other reasons um,routine,106_17,T,yq,,Koi aur kaaran hai kya?
18,it's just easier,routine,106_18,P,id,,Yeh bas aasan hai.
19,forget about problems Yeah. So affects your mood in a positive way.,symp/reasoning,106_19,T,id,,Problems ko bhool jao. Haan. Isse aapki mood mein positive tareeke se farq padta hai.
20,Yeah like I get like I like the feeling once I'm drunk,symp/reasoning,106_20,P,ack,,"Haan mujhe pata hai ki mujhe shayad ek ya do chadh chadhke maatra kaar sakta hai, lekin mujhe uss feeling ki khushi hoti hai jab mein nasha karta hoon."
21,Have you use since you had to do it?,routine,106_21,T,yq,,Tumne use kiya jab tumhe ye karna pada?
22,"Um, I haven't drank but I've as a situation. ",routine,106_22,P,id,,"Arre, I haven't piya par main ek situation mein tha."
23,So you have the use it takes away pain for you to take swings xiety feels good. But then you have these consequences of the law. And you figure those two things out.,routine,106_23,T,id,,Toh tumhari use se dard door hota hai aur tum swings lete ho toh xiety acchi lagti hai. Lekin fir tumhare paas law ke consequences hote hain. Aur tum dono cheezo ko samajh jaate ho.
24,I don't know. I don't know if there is what was your wealth of knowledge. So like not as just,routine,106_24,P,id,,Mujhe nahi pata. Mujhe nahi pata ki kya tumhare paas itni saari jaankari thi. To aise hi nahi
25,You can imagine that. So it was a good the other side. Can you imagine having further it says law enforcement like more charges in the future.,routine,106_25,T,yq,,Tum soch sakte ho. Toh woh dusra taraf acha tha. Kya tum soch sakte ho ki aage chalkar shayad kanoon suraksha mein aur zyada ilzaam honge.
26,I guess I hadn't really considered that.,inactive,106_26,P,on,,Mujhe lagta hai maine is baat ko asli taur par dhyaan nahi diya tha.
27,So you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not a really heavy consequence. And you'll be more careful in the future.,routine,106_27,T,yq,,Tuu aisa soch sakta hai ki tu ye aarop haraa sakte hai ya fir kuch zyaada bhaari saza na ho. Aur tu bhavishya mein zyada saavdhaan rahega.
28,"I don't know. Yeah, I guess so.",inactive,106_28,P,on,,"Mujhe nahi pata hai. Haan, main toh sochta hoon ki haan."
29,"So with that thinking, you continue to use as you were, that you would take out the part that got you in trouble.",routine,106_29,T,id,,"So usi soch ke, tum jaise the, aise hi chalte raho, jaise tumne uss hisse ko nikal diya jo tumhe mushkil mein daal diya tha."
30,Yeah.,inactive,106_30,P,ack,,Haan.
31,First you have to get out of trouble this time.,routine,106_31,T,id,,Pahle tumhe is baar mushkil se bahar nikalna hoga.
32,Yep.,inactive,106_32,P,ack,,Haan.
33,"So if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana, would you continue to use it?",routine,106_33,T,yq,,"Agar aap alcohol aur marijuana ke binah dard aur chinta ko dur kar sakte hai, to kya aap uska istemal jari rakhege?"
34,I just couldn't imagine,routine,106_34,P,id,,Mai bas imagine hi nahi kar sakta tha
35,So there's a social component here.,routine,106_35,T,id,,Toh yahaan ek social component hai.
36,"Yeah, a little bit. I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like nine five jobs. They don't drink every day. But I do. But like on the weekends, like all of my friends who I",routine,106_36,P,ack,,"Haan, thodi si. Main ape he mei zyada by tail jyuki keu ki samatna meri yaar nauhi nauhi nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau nau Laikin mere doston ke saath, ve jo ki, mainu jyada apni yaar sab viek mei kaam karn di jedi hain. Ve har roz nahee peek rehe hain. Par mei karta hoon. Per he hafte, ki sach mei, main apne he dostyon ja tho ja."
37,"So even if you had no anxiety, no pain You'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends. How would they respond if you went out with them? I didn't drink.",routine,106_37,T,irq,,"Toh agar tumhe koi chinta nahi hai, koi dard nahi hai toh kam se kam tumhe apne doston se woh interactions toh chhodne honge. Unki kya pratikriya hogi jab tum unke saath bahar jaoge? Maine pi nahi."
38,"Um, they probably just like wouldn't understand it, because we all go out and we get like really drunk and",routine,106_38,P,id,,"yo, they sahi mein just don't get it, kyunki hum sab nikaal ur and get drunk like crazy"
39,So it'd be socially awkward. straining the relationships with your friends. So the quitting alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you,routine,106_39,T,id,,"Toh aapko socially uncomfortable ho jayega. Aapke friends ke saath rishtey thakela hojayenge. Toh sharab aur marijuana chodna, jaise ki istemaal band karna, woh aapke liye sahi raha nahi lagta."
40,know.,inactive,106_40,P,gc,,"""Jaante"
41,But then you have this distressing situation which is making you second guessed some of it.,routine,106_41,T,id,,Lekin phir tumhare pass yeh pareshani wali stithi hai jiski wajah se tum khud ko kuch samjhane lage ho.
42,"Yeah, I mean, it's making me think that like, maybe I, I need to, like make a change. I just can't see that. That's the change I'm making. So",routine,106_42,P,ack,,"Haan, main toh soch raha hoon ki jaise, shayad maine, mujhe badalne ki zarurat hai. Bas main dekh nahi pa raha hoon. Woh hi to badlaav hai jo main kar raha hoon."
43,"you need to make some change. Yeah, but not the alcohol. Drugs.",routine,106_43,T,id,,"आपको कुछ बदलाव करने की जरूरत है। हाँ, पर शराब नहीं। ड"
44,"Yeah, yeah.",inactive,106_44,P,ack,,"Haan, haan."
45,Something else could change.,inactive,106_45,T,id,,Kuch aur badal sakta hai.
46,"Yeah, I don't know what but",inactive,106_46,P,on,,"Haan, mujhe pata nahi kya hai, par..."
47,"So you could reduce your usage, avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal. Would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety of the pain?",routine,106_47,T,irq,,"Toh kya aap apne usage ko kam kar sakte hai, driving se bach sakte hai aur yahi ho sakta hai ki aap apne goal tak pahunch jao. Kya yeh usage se pain ki tension khatam ho sakti hai?"
48,Am I just not going anywhere ever? I might not drive as often,routine,106_48,P,id,,Kya main kabhi kahin nahin ja raha hoon? Shayad main itni baar gaadi chalata nahi hoon.
49,"So that strategy might not work. That's something you've been tossing around though, this idea of isolating a little bit more, and drinking a little less. Seems like all your options here kind of grim. Yeah, that's just that's just me doesn't seem that way to you too.",routine,106_49,T,id,,"To aise strategy might not kaam kare. Ye kuch tum toss kar rahe the, ye idea of thoda isolating karke, aur thoda kam peete hue. Lagta hai ki yaha saare options kinda kharab hai. Haan, ye bas mere opinion hai, tumhe bhi aisa hi lagta hai na."
50,Now that I'm like,inactive,106_50,P,id,,Ab mai aisa hu jaise ki
51,"talking through it, yeah.",inactive,106_51,T,gc,,"Baat karke dekh liya, haan."
52,I'd like don't think I have any choice really,routine,106_52,P,od,,"Mujhe lagta hai ki mere paas koi bhi vikalp nahi hai, sach mein."
53,have any choice? What's going to happen is going to happen?,routine,106_53,T,crq,,koi bhi chunao hai    to kya hoga waise hi hoga?
54,I don't know.,routine,106_54,P,on,,Mujhe pata nahi hai.
55,All right. So let's start with the lead now. Pick up with me now. You don't want to make it bad impression in this whole court proceeding with a DUI. What do you think you could do that would make a bad impression?,routine,106_55,T,irq,,Thik hai. Toh chalo ab hum shuru karte hain lead se. Mere saath jud jao. Tumhe yeh puri court prakriya mein ek DUI ke saath kharab impression nahi banana chahte hai. Tum kya kar sakte ho jo kharab impression banane mein kaam ayega?
56,"Um, go to court drug",routine,106_56,P,id,,"Um, go to court dawaai"
57,I would do it.,routine,106_57,T,id,,Mai kar lunga.
58,"Get another DUI in the meantime, that was not good either.",routine,106_58,P,id,,"Agar aap vakt ke beech mein aur ek DUI le lo, toh yeh bhi accha nahi hoga."
59,"So you want to avoid those behaviors for sure. So you know, for sure you don't want to have sex? Would it be acceptable those things anyway?",routine,106_59,T,irq,,"Toh tum chaho ke unn kriyaon se pak ho, pak se. Toh tum jaante ho, pak se tumhein sex nahi karna hai? Kya woh cheezein bhi manzoor hogi?"
60,"I mean, not really. I mean, I think I should avoid does not like drunk driving enough. Or maybe not during the day of my court date,",routine,106_60,P,id,,"Mera matlab hai, bilkul nahi. Mera matlab hai, mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe sharab chadhna sahi nahi hai. Ya shayad meri din ki Hi court ki sair me nahi."
61,So would you appreciate those skulls like avoiding those situations I go in the court truck,routine,106_61,T,id,,Kya tum woh haddiyon ko pasand karoge jaise ki woh paristhitiyon se bachne ke liye main court truck mein jata hoon?
62,Yeah.,inactive,106_62,P,ack,,Haan.
63,Goals that you could get behind,routine,106_63,T,id,,"Tum uss lakshya ke peeche ho sakte ho, jo tum man se maante ho."
64,"I mean, I can try I guess to like think about it and Charlie get out now I'm gonna be stressed out ate my court date. It's gonna be hard to like not drink that day.",routine,106_64,P,id,,"Arre yaar, main to soch sakta hoon ki Charlie ko bahar nikaal ke stress ho gaya hoga mere court date par. Us din sharab na peena bahut mushkil hoga."
65,You're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea.,routine,106_65,T,od,,Tum mujhe iss khayaal ke baare mein atyant utsaahi nahi lag rahe ho.
66,Now,inactive,106_66,P,gc,,Abhi ab
67,"this is really tough for you is the outcome. The marriage laws are important. Yeah, this whole this book, do you I think it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed. Yeah. So is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life with fat that is gonna change things",routine,106_67,T,id,,"Yeah, yeh bahut mushkil hai tere liye. Shaadi kaanoon mahatvpurn hai. Haan, yeh saara kitaab, kya tum sochte ho ki yeh sirf kuchh par apni khushi se humdaam ho rahi hai. Haan. To kya yeh ek pareshaani hai jo tum asaani se paar kar sakte ho ya yeh ek badi zindagi ka badlav hai jo cheezein badal dega."
68,"I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it then just dealing with it. I mean, if I like don't go to court or anything that's like a worn out for me like I can't, I can't avoid this situation.",routine,106_68,P,id,,Mujhe maloom nahi kyunki mujhe kisi aur tarah se uske aas paas se deal karne se alawa koi aur tareeka nahi pata. Main mera matlab ye hai ki agar main court nahi jaata ya koi aur cheez nahi karta to usse mere liye ek worn out ho jaata hai jaise main is situation se bach nahi sakta.
69,"But if there's a condition of your treatment, the judge says no more drinking is no more marijuana period. We can see that that if you obey those rules or word, jail",routine,106_69,T,id,,"Par agar aapke treatment ka shart hai, toh judge kehte hain ki ab aur nasha nahi aur na hi marijuana ka samay. Hum dekh sakte hain ki agar aap uss rule ya shabd ka palan karein toh jail."
70,"now, I couldn't get to that. I know it possibly could probably well, but I was I don't know.",routine,106_70,P,id,,"Abhi abhi, mujhe us tak pahunchne mein nahi ho paya. Main jaanta hoon ki shayad ho sakta hai, lekin mai kya karu, mai nahi jaanta."
71,I would think it almost certainly would have happened. Yeah.,routine,106_71,T,id,,Mujhe lagta hai ki yeh hakikat mein ho chuka hoga. Haan.
72,I don't know what I'm gonna do.,inactive,106_72,P,on,,मुझे नहीं पता मैं क्या करने जा र
73,back a couple of steps. How long have you been using the alcohol marijuana?,symp/reasoning,106_73,T,irq,,Kuch kadam piche jaao. Tum alcohol marijuana ka istemaal kitni der se kar rahe ho?
74,"For about like, six years, six years.",symp/reasoning,106_74,P,id,,"Lagbag, chahe, chhe saal, chhe saal."
75,"Have you ever until now with the DUI, have you ever envisioned stopping? Now, what's your plan? Like pre d? Why was your plan and all this?",routine,106_75,T,yq,,"ab kya apne ap ko hamesha se DUI, ko ka socha hai, ki kya apna irada hai rokne ka? ab, kya hai aapka plan? jaise rok d? are, aapka plan kya tha, aur saara hai kya?"
76,I just had dinner like the jerking kind of has gotten worse.,routine,106_76,P,id,,मैंने अभी रात का खाना खाया है जैसे कि उसका सभूत्ती
77,Yeah. So without this or something you would have continued using?,routine,106_77,T,yq,,Haan. Toh bina iske kya tum chalte rehte?
78,"Yeah, I didn't really have any like",routine,106_78,P,id,,"Haan, mujhe kuch bhi pasand nahi tha, sach mein."
79,until now. Yeah. Could this be a strange way like an opportunity?,routine,106_79,T,yq,,Ab tak. Haan. Kya ye kisi tarah se ek mauka ki tarah ho sakta hai?
80,"I mean, I guess if I had if I wanted to stop by this would be a way for me to stop or reason for me to stop.",routine,106_80,P,id,,"Mai samajhta hu, main sochta hu ki agar main chahta toh main yahaan rukh sakta hu ye mere liye ek tarika hoga rukhne ka ya kaaran rukhne ka."
81,If you really wanted to stop because your stuff,routine,106_81,T,id,,Agar tum sach mein rokna chahte toh kyonki tumhara saman hai.
82,I don't know.,routine,106_82,P,on,,Mujhe nahi pata hai.
83,you could give a shot. You're just not sure you could. You could actually do it.,routine,106_83,T,id,,Tum ek baar try kar sakte ho. Tum bilkul yakin nahi hai ki tum kar sakte ho. Tum actually kar sakoge.
84,"Yeah, I mean, I've never tried to before so I don't know.",routine,106_84,P,on,,"मैंयह मतलब है, मैंने पहले कभी नहीं कोशिश किया था तो मु"
85, It's just unknown.,routine,106_85,T,id,,Yeh toh bas anjaana hai.

94,summary,"The patient got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol and marijuana about a week ago. The patient is not losing any social support by stopping to drink since they do it alone. They do it for pain relief and feeling good. There is a little social component of drinking with friends during the weekends. The patient has been drinking and using marijuana for six years now. The patient hasn't really considered to stop using, but they feel they can if they intend to stop. The therapist offers to meet again since the court hearing is not for another few weeks. They promise to have IEP and other things in the second week and pick up with that.  ",,,,,
