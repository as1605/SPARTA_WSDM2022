0,Thanks for coming along today broke. I've really been looking forward to meeting you.,inactive,110_0,T,gt,,"Aaj aajke saath aana ke liye dhanyavaad, you're broke. I am eagerly waiting to meet you."
1," Yeah, me too. ",inactive,110_1,P,ack,,"Haan, main bhi."
2,"Cool. Okay. So I just wanted to ask, did you receive that information pack that was sent out to you in the mail? ",inactive,110_2,T,yq,,Thik hai. Accha. Toh main bas ye puchna chahta tha ki kya tumhe woh information pack mila jo tere paas mail ke through bheja gaya tha?
3,"Yes, I did. ",inactive,110_3,P,op,,Haan maine kiya.
4,Fabulous. Okay. So would you mind if we just spend a few minutes going through that together now?,inactive,110_4,T,yq,,Kya baat hai. Thik hai. Kya aapko koi problem hogi agar hum ab woh saath mein kuch minutes nikal lein?
5,"Yeah, no, that's okay. ",inactive,110_5,P,op,,"Haan, nahi, woh thik hai."
6,"So I guess something really important that I would like to draw your attention to first of all, is this issue here of confidentiality, okay. Basically, everything that you and I talk about together in therapy is just between you and I, however, because I am a professional psychologist, the things that we discussed, I may need to share with my supervisor, okay. ",inactive,110_6,T,id,,"Toh main samajhta hoon ki kuch bahut hi mahatvapurna cheezein hain jin par main aapki dhyaan aakarshit karna chahta hoon, yeh hamari guftagoo ki gopniyat ka mamla hai, tik hai. Ekta toh, hamare beech jo bhi baatein hain, woh sirf aap aur main ke beech mein hain, lekin kyonki main ek professional psychologist hoon, toh jo cheezein humne discuss ki, usse main apne supervisor ke saath bhi share kar sakta hoon, theek hai."
7,"Yeah, yeah, that's all right. Will it only be with your supervisor?",inactive,110_7,P,yq,,"Haan, haan, woh theek hai. Ye sirf aapke supervisor ke saath hi hoga na?"
8," Yeah, that's right. Yep. Yeah. There are a few special circumstances though, where I may have to break confidentiality. That is if you tell me that you might be of harm to yourself or someone else. Okay. If you tell me that you've been involved in a serious crime, okay for us. Somebody else wishes to access the information that we talked about in the context of legal proceedings and they take it off subpeona I'm required to give that information then okay. But of course, if any of these things ever did come up, I would discuss these with you first. Okay, that'd be good. Okay. All right. All right. So something else I just would like to draw your attention to here as well. It's just our fee here at the clinic. Yes. Which as we discussed on the phone is $20.",routine,110_8,T,ack,,"He haan, vahi sahi hai. Haan. Haan. Vahi kuch khaas mauke hai, jahaan main gopniyata todna pad sakta hai. Yadi aap mujhe bataye ki aap apne aap ko ya kisi aur ko nuksaan pahucha sakte hai, tab main tod dunga. Thik hai. Yadi aap mujhe bataye ki aapne gambheer jurm mein liya hai, to hamare liye thik hai. Koi aur vyakti ne hamare baare mein baat ki hai aur uski jaankari humare paas subpeona dwara chahiye, to main us jaankari ko dena zaroori hai. Lekin haan, yadi in sab baaton mein se kuch bhi hua to main aapke saath pehle baat karunga. Thik hai, yeh achcha hoga. Thik hai. Theek hai. Theek hai. To kuch aur main aapki dhyaan mein yahan par laana chahta hu, yeh bhi hamare klinic ki fees hai. Haan. Jiska humne phone par baat ki thi, vah 20 dollar hai."
9,Yes. And that's fine. No problems.,routine,110_9,P,id,,Haan aur Wahi toh theek hai. Koi pareshaani nahi.
10,Okay. And I understand from time to time that things can come up as well and that you might have to reschedule one of your appointment. We just asked that if you could provide us with about 24 hours notice beforehand shot so that gives us a chance to be able to set up another appointment time.,routine,110_10,T,id,,Okay. Aur main samajhta hu ki kabhi kabhi kuch cheezein aa sakti hain aur aapko apne appointment ko badalna pad sakta hai. Hum bas yeh kehte hain ki agar aap pichle 24 ghante se pehle humein inform kar sakein toh humein mauka milega ki hum dusra appointment ka samay tayyar kar sakein.
11,"Yeah, yeah, that's fine. No worries. ",routine,110_11,P,op,,"Haan, haan, theek hai. Chinta mat karo."
12,Okay. Did you have any other questions about anything that you read on that shape there?,routine,110_12,T,yq,,Okay. Kya aapke paas kisi aur cheez par padhai ke bare mein koi aur sawaal hai jo aapne us shape par padha?
13,"Um, no. it all seems fine with me. Yeah. ",routine,110_13,P,on,,"Na, yea toh sab sahi lag raha hai mereko. Haan."
14,Yeah. Okay. So if you wouldn't mind just popping your signature at the bottom there. Thanks.,routine,110_14,T,id,,अरे। ठीक है। तो अगर आप जरूरत न हो तो बस वहाँ नीचे अपने हस्ताक्षर दे दें। ध
15,"I haven't, I'm feeling a little nervous. ",routine,110_15,P,od,-2.0,"मैंने नहीं किया है, मुझे थोड़ा घ"
16,"Yeah, I can understand that it can be a bit confronting and scary The first time you come along. Yeah. So I guess, I mean, just to give you a bit of an idea about how I like to work with clients, is that I like it to be a collaborative approach so that the two of us get to work together on new problems and concerns that you're having at the moment. Okay. ",routine,110_16,T,id,,"Haan, main samajh sakti hun ki ye thoda challenging aur daravna ho sakta hai jab pehli baar aap aaoge. Haan. Toh main yahi samajhti hun ki hum dono ek saath kaam karenge, aur humare beech naye masle aur pareshaniyon par mil ke kaam karenge jo aap abhi face kar rahe hain. Theek hai."
17,Yeah. Sounds good.,routine,110_17,P,ack,,Haan. Sunte hue accha lag raha hai.
18,"So the purpose of today's session, I guess, would be for me to get more of an understanding of what's happening for you lately. All right, and give us a chance to get to know each other a little bit more. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's really good. Yeah. And at the end, we can sort of have a touch base again and see how we went for today and whether we'd like to take it on from there.",story,110_18,T,id,,"Aaj ke session ka maksad mujhe yeh samajhna hai ki aapke haalat mein kya ho raha hai. Aur hame ek dusre ko thoda aur jaan ne ka mauka dena. Thik hai. Thik hai. Haan. Haan, yeh bahot achcha hai. Aur session ke ant mein, hum phir se baat kar sakte hain aur dekh sakte hain ki aaj hum kaise rehte hain aur kya hum waha se age badhna chahte hain ya nahi."
19," Yeah, that sounds good. We'll have a better idea then. ",routine,110_19,P,op,,"Haan, yeh achha lag raha hai. Tab humein behtar idea hoga."
20,"Yes, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay. So I mean, just to start off with then I guess, are there any other things that you've tried apart from coming to therapy and As some ways to help you cope with what's happening for you.",symp/reasoning,110_20,T,irq,,"Haan, haan, bilkul sahi. Haan. Theek hai. Toh main bas shuru karna chahungi ki kya aapne koi aur cheez try ki hai, therapy ke alawa, apne jo ho raha hai ke saamna karne ke liye."
21,"Umm not really like when I feel ya know, when I feel down like I just stay at home. Yeah, I don't really go anywhere. Yeah. or do anything I just yeah, just sort of withdraw. That's all I really done. ",symp/reasoning,110_21,P,on,,"Umm not really like when I feel ya know, when I feel down like I just stay at home. Yeah, I don't really go anywhere. Yeah. or do anything I just yeah, just sort of hatao. I really done ke baare mein bas utarta hoon."
22,Yeah. We've been really keeping it to yourself and it's quite a big step for you to reach out to to someone today.,routine,110_22,T,id,,Haan. Humne sach mein apne aap ko sambhala hua hai aur yeh aapke liye ek bada kadam hai ki aaj kisi se madad maangne ke liye aap ne koshish ki hai.
23,"Yeah, it is. It just got to that point where he just wanted to come in and didn't really know what to do. Yeah. ",routine,110_23,P,id,,"Haan, yeh tha. Bas uss point tak pahunch gaya tha jahaan usse aana chahta tha aur use kuch bhi samajh nahi aa raha tha. Haan."
24,"Okay, I guess to start off with him. Would you like to tell me a little bit more about what's been happening for you? ",inactive,110_24,T,yq,,"Thik hai, shuruwat karne se pehle main samajh chuka hu ki tumse juda hua hai. Kya tum mujhe apne baare mein thoda aur bataoge jo tumhare saath ho raha hai?"
25,"Yes, sure.",inactive,110_25,P,op,,"Haan, zaroor."
