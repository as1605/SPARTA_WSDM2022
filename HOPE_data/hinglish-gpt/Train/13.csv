0,"I know it's uncomfortable. Because it sucks like this therapy is just like a not getting anywhere. Like it's just not like doing anything. So yeah, it's like it's uncomfortable to talk about because it's like I don't know.",symp/reasoning,13_0,P,com,,"Mujhe pata hai ye uncomfortable hai. Kyunki yeh therapy aisi hai jaise ki kuchh hone hi nahi de rahi hai. Jaise ki yeh kuchh kar hi nahi rahi hai. Toh haan, iske baare mein baat karna uncomfortable hai kyunki mujhe yeh pata hi nahi hai."
1,My sense is that you're trying to say something and then you just kind of almost like gave up there.,inactive,13_1,T,orq,,Meri samajh mein hai ki tum kuch kehne ki koshish kar rahe ho par phir achanak se haat daal diya.
2,"Well, what I'm trying to talk about and I don't know what else like you want me to do. I told you that I'm not good. I'm getting something out of therapy. I feel like I'm being very clear, but I guess I'm not.",routine,13_2,P,od,,"Well, mujhe jo baat karni hai uske baare mein aur mujhe pata nahi ki aur kya karna chahte ho tum. Maine tumhe bata diya hai ki main acchi nahi hoon. Main therapy se kuchh hasil kar rahi hoon. Mujhe lagta hai ki main bahut saaf-saaf bol rahi hoon, lekin shayad main nahi hoon."
3,Are you feeling angry at me?,routine,13_3,T,irq,,Kya tum mujh par gussa ho rahi ho?
4,"I mean, I'm feeling angry that the therapy isn't working. Like I've been saying. I'm feeling angry that like, I'm still in the place that I'm in. Even though I've been trying. I'm like, just feeling like, I'm feeling like pissed in general, you know? ",routine,13_4,P,id,,"Mujhe matlab hai, mujhe gussa aa raha hai ki terapi kaam nahi kar rahi hai. Jaise ki maine kaha tha. Mujhe gussa aa raha hai ki main wahi jagah par hu jaha par main abhi hu. Bina kisi karan ke. Mujhe esa lag raha hai ki main kisi kaam ka nahi hu, pata hai?"
5,"Right. So, you know, I understand that you're pissed in general. But are you angry at me? I mean, it sounds to my senses here that you're feeling angry at me right now. If you are. I really want to know about it.",routine,13_5,T,crq,,"Sahi. Toh, tum jaante ho, main samajh sakta hu ki tum gussa ho generally. Par kya mujhse gussa ho? Mera yahaan se sense ho raha hai ki tum abhi mujhse gussa feel kar rahi ho. Agar ho toh. Main sach mein iske baare mein jaana chahta hu."
6,"Well, I mean, I guess there is a part of me that's like a little. Yeah, a little angry. That you're not the Helping me. I came is there because I wanted to feel better. And yeah, I mean, I guess I am feeling angry that that's not like what I'm getting from you even though that's what I what I'm trying to get. So",story,13_6,P,cd,,"Arre yaar, I know na, I mean there is a part of me that's like thoda. Haan, ekdum thoda gussa hai. Ki you're not Helping me. Mai yahan aya because I wanted to feel better. Aur haan, I mean I guess main gussa feel kar raha hoon ki wahi main tujhse expect kar raha tha, but you're not giving me that, jaisi ki mujhe chahiye."
7,"yeah, you're sounding really exasperated to me. How does it feel to tell me about this?",routine,13_7,T,crq,,"Haan, aap mujhe bahut pareshaan lag rahe hain. Isse batane par aapko kaisa lagta hai?"
8,"It feels hard. I mean, the feels hard to say that I'm angry. It's like not a feel it's not a comfortable thing to say or not a comfortable thing to feel. It's just like makes me like",routine,13_8,P,cd,,"Yeh mushkil ho raha hai. Matlab ye mushkil ho raha hai ki main gussa hun kehna. Ye ek feel nahi hai, ye kehna ya mehsus karna comfortable nahi hai. Ye sirf ek aisa hai jo mujhe aise feel karata hai."
9,"Okay, so I want to push you too hard. But can you say any more about that while you're what's uncomfortable bother. So I mean, I do understand that it's uncomfortable. I mean,",routine,13_9,T,irq,,"Theek hai, main chahta hoon ki tumhe zyada dabao. Lekin kya tum uske baare mein aur kuch keh sakte ho jab tak ki tumhe kya pareshani ho rahi hai. Toh matlab, main samajh raha hoon ki yeh pareshani ki baat hai. Toh matlab, main..."
10,"it's not something I would like ordinarily say to someone that I'm angry at them, so feels like, I feel like I'm kind of anxious now like even saying, like, I don't want you to think I just like that. It's like your fault. It just like feels like I'm like, that's something I'm really not supposed to say.",symp/reasoning,13_10,P,id,,"Ye aisa kuch hai jo main normally kisi ko naraaz hote hue nahi bolna chahta, toh aisa lagta hai ki, mujhe aise bolne se thoda sa ghabrahat si ho rahi hai, jaise ki, main chahta hoon ki aap mujhe aisi baat karne se mat sochein, yeh aapki koi galti nahi hai. Yeh mujhe aisa lagta hai ki main aisa kuch bilkul bhi nahi kehna chahiye."
11,"So, I mean, part of it sounds like is you're concerned that I'm going to feel like you're blaming me.",symp/reasoning,13_11,T,orq,,"Toh, mera matlab hai, uska ek hissa aisa lag raha hai ki tum chinta kar rahe ho ki main tumhe dosh de rahi hu."
12,"Really? I guess. I don't want to do that. But yeah. Yeah. It is hard to feel like this. I feel like I'm alone in this therapy that like, I've been coming here and trying and I'm just not like getting anything from you. Okay, so that",story,13_12,P,od,,"Are you serious? I believe so. I don't want to do that. But haan. It's difficult to feel this way. I feel like aaulone in this therapy, like I've been attending and struggling, but I'm not getting anything from you. Fine, then."
13,"sounds really important, right? It sounds like you're you know, it's hard to say this. But you're you know, you're feeling angry of the maybe you feeling disappointed? You're feeling all alone. Yeah, like you can't even really talk with me about this.",routine,13_13,T,crq,,"Sounds bahut hi zaruri hai, na? It sounds like tu samajh raha hai, its difficult to say this. Lekin tu samajh raha hai, tu gussa ho raha hai ya shayad disappointed feel kar raha hai? Tu akela feel kar raha hai. Haan, jaise ki tu mujhse iss ke baare mein bola bhi nahi jaa sakta."
14,"Yeah, feels really hard and I want to be able to.",inactive,13_14,P,cd,,"Haan, yeh bahut mushkil lag raha hai aur main yeh kar sakti hon."
15,Okay.,inactive,13_15,T,ack,,Thik hai.
16,"I'm still feeling a little anxious, but I mean, I think it's better feels better that it's like out there. I guess that I'd like said it and I think maybe that helps. ",story,13_16,P,orq,,"Mai abhi bhi thoda anxious feel kar rahi hu, but I mean, mujhe lagta hai ki yeh better hain ki yeh baat bahar aa gayi hai. Shayad maine yeh kah diya hai isliye shayad ye madad karta hai."
17,"Okay, so let's so at least it's out there. Right.",inactive,13_17,T,od,,"Theek hai, toh kam se kam yeh baat ab khul gayi hai. Thik hai."
18,summary,"The patient was feeling angry that the therapy wasn't getting them anywhere. The patient was anxious to share that they are angry at the therapist since it is not something they usually say. The therapist clarifies that the patient is concerned if the therapist would feel like they are blaming them. The patient further adds that they feel alone in this therapy. But they feel better now that they have shared everything, it helps them.",,,,,
