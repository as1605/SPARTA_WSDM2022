"Okay. Ami just as far as Okay, if I take notes as we go through is just, Ami trying to, I guess samajhtei ache what you're telling me and it helps me to likhte parchi it down and I'll share this with you later. Okay, so it sounds like those are those are some quite negative thoughts to have. You're kind of saying, you know, it feels like it's pointless, It's more effort than it's worth. And I don't deserve to be here. I mean, when you have those thoughts, how do you feel?",T,"gc, irq"
Very unworthy. Probably will be the best way to put it kind of I didn't know lower than normal. It makes me think about all the Things I should have been doing better.,P,id
"Okay, so what you described that you said, Ami unworthy, I should be doing lots of things better. And those are kind of what I would call thoughts Actually, Ami suppose Ami trying to samajhtei ache what it feels like in your gut. What kind of emotions do you feel happier? Do you feel sad? What kind of emotions you're feeling when you have those thoughts?",T,"gc, irq"
Sad not happy with. Ami have kind of anger and frustration as well.,P,id
"Okay. I just when you kind of tell me this, and Ami know this is quite heavy topic. But you're kind of laughing and Ami suppose Ami wonder a little bit of your a bit. You know, how do you feel about having these emotions? Talking about these emotions?",T,"gc, irq"
"Yes. embarrassed. Ami've never yet talked about it, So it's quite uncomfortable to be in this situation.",P,id
"Well, you're doing a great job because Ami know Ami know that this can be difficult. Okay, so it sounds like some of the thoughts you're describing are, it's pointless, it's more than it's worth. I don't deserve to be here. Ami unworthy. And those kind of thoughts. It sounds like they just flit through your mind. And then he's kind of describing different emotions that those lead to kind of screaming sad, anger, frustration, embarrassed. What about in your body? What happens? How do you feel kind of physically?",T,"gc, irq"
"Ami used to be, Ami think from those emotions very wound up very kind of stressed all the time. Recently, it's just a lot more draining than anything, just quite lethargic and can't be bothered anymore. And it's, my body reflects that. But then when Ami try and sleep Ami just can't seem to have a satisfied by sleep. It's really, really frustrating.",P,id
"So it sounds like this is affecting, it's draining you of your energy, like, like your body can't be bothered. Ami think that's a really good way of describing it. And you're noticing sleep problems as well. And then what do you do? So this is so we're back to the point before the lecture. So you start having these thoughts, these emotions, and you know your body, I guess it sounds like those thoughts quite draining. So be draining your energy, what then happens what you do next?",T,"gc, irq"
"kind of focus on the negative thoughts when Ami probably should not think about them, but Ami focus on them and then Ami don't really want to do anything gonna stay in bed or",P,id
"So you think even more about those kind of warnings that you have to do a bit of dwelling any say in bed. And it sounds like you don't, you haven't tried speaking to your friends about it. Okay, and then after you've done that, so after you've not gone to the lecture, you've stayed in bed, you kind of spent time As you said, focusing on those those thoughts, those negative thoughts, how do you feel after that to feel better? Or do you feel worse?",T,"gc, irq"
"Ami guess Ami felt slightly worse, but then a bit numb in a way, kind of once you've felt bad because Ami do feel tired all the time, Ami just try and push it out. And then you don't really think about anything. And it's almost nicer that way than to keep focusing on how much you're getting wrong and how much you can't do stuff. Sometimes it's better just to not think about it at all.",P,id
"So it sounds like in some ways, it's a bit of a relief to do that, But in other ways, maybe you think it might make things worse,",T,gc
probably in the long run.,P,gc
